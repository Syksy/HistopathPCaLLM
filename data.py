            "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks. In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. The finding thus fits the suspected benign prostate hyperplasia.",

            ["Transurethral resection chippings were obtained after operation, totalling 10g in sample weight. Examination of the chippings provided evidence of adenocarcinoma with heterogeneous growth patterns, with Gleason grading major 4 and minor 3. The identified minor components were distributed focally, totalling around 10% of tumor area, with the major component prominent in whole sample (totalling around 40% of tumor area). The non-tumorous area exhibited benign hyperplasia, with further chronic inflammation patterns. The ISUP Grade Group 3 suggests that patient should be possibly screened or biopsied further in addition to his on-going active surveillance, as cribriform-like patterns were pointed out by colleague John Doe, MD, during post-BPH treatment consultation.", "TURP", "yes|kyllä|ja", "^4\\+3=7$"],
