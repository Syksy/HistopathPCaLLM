Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Several sampling sites are available from standard locations. One sample part appears to be not representative, as it contains no prostate tissue. Otherwise the sampled tissue appears representative of prostate tissue. While no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue, the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes.
