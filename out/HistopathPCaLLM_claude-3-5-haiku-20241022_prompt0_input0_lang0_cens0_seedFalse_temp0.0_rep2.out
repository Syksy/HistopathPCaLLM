{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "chipping samples"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly states "no malignancies, or carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and the finding is described as benign prostate hyperplasia
