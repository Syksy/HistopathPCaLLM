{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "chipping samples"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly states "no malignancies, or carcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
