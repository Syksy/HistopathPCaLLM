{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor finding is "no" because the conclusion states the finding is "leaning towards benign" and the diagnosis is "uncertain"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant diagnosis was made
