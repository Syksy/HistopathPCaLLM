{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" because no specific type of prostate sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) was definitively mentioned.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: "no" because the statement mentions "normal basal cells" and does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor.
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" since no malignant tumor was identified and no Gleason grading was performed.
