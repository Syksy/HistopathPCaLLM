{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The text mentions "normal basal cells" and does not confirm any malignant tumor, so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor is found, "NA" is used.
