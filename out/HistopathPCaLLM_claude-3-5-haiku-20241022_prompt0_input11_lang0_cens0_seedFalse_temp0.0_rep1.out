{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit mention of "invasive tumor tissue"
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly stated in the text, with primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 3, summing to a Gleason score of 7
