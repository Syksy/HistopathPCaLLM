{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of a prepared sample with limited material (approximately 5% investigated)
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement does not confirm a definitive malignant tumor, and mentions inability to reliably assess Gleason scores
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a confirmed malignant finding and the statement that Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed
