{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of a prepared sample with limited material (approximately 5% investigated)
2. Malignant tumor is "no" because while Gleason scores are mentioned, no definitive malignant finding is stated
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no confirmed malignant tumor was identified
