{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of a prepared sample with limited material (approximately 5% investigated)
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as no definitive malignancy is confirmed, and the statement suggests inconclusive findings
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no clear malignancy was detected and the Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed
