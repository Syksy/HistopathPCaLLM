{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "electrosection shavings from the prostate"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says the material is "classified as benign"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
