{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because while cancer is present, no specific Gleason grading details are provided in the text
