{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text mentions "samples" and describes taking samples from prostate locations, which suggests this is a biopsy.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While there are "suspicious patterns" mentioned, the text does not definitively confirm malignant tumor findings. The statement suggests further verification is needed, so the finding is not conclusively malignant.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
