{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes "samples" taken from prostate locations, which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor: While there are "suspicious patterns" mentioned, no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed. The text suggests further consultation is needed, so the finding is not conclusively malignant.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
