{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Key reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description of "prostatetectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit mention of "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as specified in the text, with the description that the larger portion is score 3 (approximately 60%)
