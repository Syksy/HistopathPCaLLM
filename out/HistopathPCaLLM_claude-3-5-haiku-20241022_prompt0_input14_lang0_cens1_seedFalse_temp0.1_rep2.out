{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes a comprehensive prostate tissue sample with multiple batches of samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), which suggests a biopsy.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While the text mentions "special patterns of cell growth", there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy. The text actually suggests further investigation is needed.
3. Gleason Grade: No definitive Gleason grade is reported. A colleague mentioned a previous patient with Gleason 7, but this is not applicable to the current patient. The text explicitly states that further histopathological investigation is warranted.
