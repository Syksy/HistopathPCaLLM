{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "prostate chippings" which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" as the text explicitly confirms "adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material".
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as the statement indicates Gleason 4 is most represented, with a sum of 8, suggesting a Gleason score of 4+4.
