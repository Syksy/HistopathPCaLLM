{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Prostate tissue material"
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because while clinical notes suggest a suspected adenocarcinoma, the histopathological examination could not confirm this
- Gleason grade is "NA" as the report explicitly states that a representative Gleason grade could not be determined at this time

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
1. "could not be determined at this time"
2. "Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session"
3. The suspicion is based on clinical notes, not on the actual histopathological findings
