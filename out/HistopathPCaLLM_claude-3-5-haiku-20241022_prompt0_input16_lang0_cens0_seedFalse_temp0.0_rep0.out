{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "three fusion biopsies"
- Malignant tumor is "yes" due to explicit description of carcinoma focuses
- Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the conclusion statement specifying architecture 3 covering 2/3 and architecture 4 covering 1/3 of the carcinoma part
