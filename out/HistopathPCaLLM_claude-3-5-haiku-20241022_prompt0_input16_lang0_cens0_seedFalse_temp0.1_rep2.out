{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

The reasoning for this structured output:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "three fusion biopsies"
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" due to explicit description of carcinoma focuses
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the conclusion statement describing architecture 3 covering about 2/3 and architecture 4 covering about 1/3 of the carcinoma part
