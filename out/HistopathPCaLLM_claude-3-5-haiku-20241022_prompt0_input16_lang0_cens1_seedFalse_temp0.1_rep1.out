{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "biopsy" - The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and discusses digital histopathology of the sample, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: "yes" - The text indicates suspicious foci and mentions cell differentiation patterns suggestive of potential malignancy.
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" - While the text suggests potential malignancy, it explicitly states that explicit Gleason scoring is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and manual review is recommended. Therefore, a definitive Gleason grade cannot be assigned.
