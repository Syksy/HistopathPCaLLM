{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and suggests further manual review of slides.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the text mentions "suspicious foci" and discusses potential tumor cell differentiation grades.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because the text explicitly states that explicit scoring is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and recommends manual grading before definitive assessment.
