{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the detailed description of a prostatectomy preparate
- Malignant tumor is "yes" due to multiple clear tumor foci and description of tumor infiltration
- Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the statement indicates the most dominant grade is 4, with some grade 3, and the most severe lesion is described as Gleason 4+3
