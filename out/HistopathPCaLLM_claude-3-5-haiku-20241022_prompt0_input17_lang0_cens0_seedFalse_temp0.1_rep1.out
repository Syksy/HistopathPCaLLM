{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- "Prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen
- Multiple clear foci of tumor with Gleason pattern 4 and 3 are described
- The most dominant pattern is Gleason 4, with some Gleason 3, so the grade is reported as 4+3=7
- Perineural invasion and capsular penetration confirm malignancy
