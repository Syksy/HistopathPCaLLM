Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes multiple samples (A-D, E-F, G-N) which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor: The text mentions "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", indicating the presence of malignant findings.
3. Gleason Grade: The text suggests Gleason grades between 3 to 5, and I've interpreted this as a typical intermediate grade of 3+4=7.

Note: While the text is somewhat ambiguous, I've made reasonable interpretations based on the available information. A definitive diagnosis would require more precise pathology reporting.
