{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The text describes a prostate biopsy sample with multiple tissue sites
- While the text mentions potential Gleason grades between 3-5, no definitive malignant finding is conclusively stated
- The text suggests this is a preliminary report pending further assessment
- Therefore, I've used "NA" for malignant tumor findings and Gleason grade, and "biopsy" for sample type
