{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" which is typical of a biopsy.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the text explicitly mentions carcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area", which translates to a primary Gleason grade of 3 and a secondary grade of 4.
