{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first line
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of sample 4 having Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%) components
