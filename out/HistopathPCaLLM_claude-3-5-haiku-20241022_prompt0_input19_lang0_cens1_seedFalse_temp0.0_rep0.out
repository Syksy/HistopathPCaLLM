{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because while sample 4 has uncertain characteristics, no definitive malignant finding is confirmed. Most samples (1-3) are described as benign or unrepresentative.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no confirmed malignancy is present, and further verification is needed for sample 4.
