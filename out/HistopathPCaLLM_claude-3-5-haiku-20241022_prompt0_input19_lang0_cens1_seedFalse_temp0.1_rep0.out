{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples processed from prostate tissue
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because while sample 4 has uncertain characteristics, no definitive malignancy is confirmed
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no confirmed malignancy is present
