{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the text ("12 representative needle biopsies")
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the conclusion states "only benign-like growth is observed"
3. Since no malignant tumor was found, the Gleason grade is set to "NA"
