{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to multiple mentions of adenocarcinoma
3. The Gleason grade is "4+4=8" based on the description of the basis presenting mostly with class 4+4, which takes precedence over the 3+4 from the apex section
