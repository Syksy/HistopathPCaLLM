{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" and describes multiple samples from different regions, which suggests a biopsy.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The text explicitly states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region", which means no definitive malignant tumor finding can be confirmed.
3. Gleason Grade: While a hypothetical "3+4" Gleason grade is mentioned, the text emphasizes that no actual assessment can be made due to the patient's treatment history and tissue alteration.
