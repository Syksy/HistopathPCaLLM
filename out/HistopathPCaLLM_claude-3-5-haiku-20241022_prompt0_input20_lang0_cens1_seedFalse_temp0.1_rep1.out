{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" and describes multiple samples from different regions, which suggests a biopsy.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement explicitly indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" and the tissue samples are highly affected by previous therapies, so the finding is "NA".
3. Gleason Grade: Due to the inability to definitively assess the tissue and the mention that even a hypothetical Gleason grade (3+4) cannot be confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
