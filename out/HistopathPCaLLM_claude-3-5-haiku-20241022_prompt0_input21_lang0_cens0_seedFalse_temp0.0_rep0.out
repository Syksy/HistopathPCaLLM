{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of tumor-like tissue and tumor characteristics
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9" as the most severe lesion shows primary pattern 5 and secondary pattern 4, which sum to 9
