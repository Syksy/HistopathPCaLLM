{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments
2. Malignant tumor findings cannot be definitively determined due to technical issues with the sample ("nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise confounds assessment")
3. Gleason grade cannot be determined due to poor sample quality, hence "NA"

The key observations supporting this interpretation are:
- Fragments of prostate material suggest a biopsy
- Technical problems with the sample prevent clear tumor assessment
- The statement explicitly mentions the need for additional quality control (QC)
