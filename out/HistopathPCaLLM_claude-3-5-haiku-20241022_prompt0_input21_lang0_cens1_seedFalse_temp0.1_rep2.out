{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm the presence of malignant cells
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the pathological assessment, with mentions of technical noise and unclear cell differentiation patterns

The statement suggests significant technical limitations in the sample's assessment, preventing a clear determination of malignancy or grading.
