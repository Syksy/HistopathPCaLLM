{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement describes "prostate thick needle biopsies"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the left side fragments show carcinoma tissue structures
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", with the primary (first) pattern being 3 and secondary (second) pattern being 4
