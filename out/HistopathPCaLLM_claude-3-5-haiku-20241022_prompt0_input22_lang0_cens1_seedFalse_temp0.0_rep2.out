{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of tissue sampling material with fragmented pieces from left and right sides.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly indicates that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and need reprocessing.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the inability to definitively assign a Gleason score, with the text noting that "assigning a Gleason... proves to be exceptionally difficult".
