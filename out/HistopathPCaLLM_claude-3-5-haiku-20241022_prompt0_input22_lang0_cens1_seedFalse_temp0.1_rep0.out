{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of tissue sampling material with multiple fragments.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly indicates that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and need to be reprocessed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the inability to definitively assign a Gleason score, with the text noting that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult".
