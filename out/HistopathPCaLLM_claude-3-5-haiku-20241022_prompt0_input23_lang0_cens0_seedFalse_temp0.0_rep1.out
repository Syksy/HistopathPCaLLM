{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Key reasoning:
- "prostatectomy preparate" indicates sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy)
- Presence of adenocarcinoma with detailed Gleason grading confirms malignant tumor
- Gleason score is explicitly stated as 9, with primary grade 4 (60% of tumor) and secondary grade 5 (30% of tumor)
- Tertiary grade 3 is noted but does not change the primary Gleason grade calculation
