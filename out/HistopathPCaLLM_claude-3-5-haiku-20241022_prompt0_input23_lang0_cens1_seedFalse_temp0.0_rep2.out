{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The text describes a biopsy sample with multiple sections
- There are no definitive malignant tumor findings confirmed in this statement
- While a prior report mentioned potential Gleason 3 findings, the current statement is inconclusive and recommends reprocessing the sample
- Therefore, the structured result reflects uncertainty with "NA" values
