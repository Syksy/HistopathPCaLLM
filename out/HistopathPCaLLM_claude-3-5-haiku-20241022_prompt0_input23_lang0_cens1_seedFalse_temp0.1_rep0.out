{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of prepared sample set and multiple macro/microscopic sections
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because no definitive malignancy is confirmed in the statement
- Gleason grade is "NA" since the statement indicates potential findings but no conclusive diagnosis, with a recommendation to reprocess the sample
