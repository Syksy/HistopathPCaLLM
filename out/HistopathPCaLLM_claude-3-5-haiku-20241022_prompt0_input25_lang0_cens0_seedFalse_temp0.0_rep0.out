{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because multiple small tissue cylinders were examined
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" as the conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on the most severe sample (Sample 1 and 2 both have Gleason pattern, with Sample 1 showing 4 pattern 20% and 3 pattern 30%, and Sample 2 showing similar pattern). The more severe pattern (4) is listed first in the Gleason score.
