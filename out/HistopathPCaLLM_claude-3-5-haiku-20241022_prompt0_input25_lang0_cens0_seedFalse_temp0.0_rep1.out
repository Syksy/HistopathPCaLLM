{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as multiple small tissue cylinders were examined
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" as the conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is determined by the most severe lesion (Sample 1 and 2), which shows Gleason 4+3=7 pattern. I chose Sample 1's pattern as it has a slightly more extensive tumor involvement (4mm vs 5mm) and the Gleason grade is 4+3=7.
