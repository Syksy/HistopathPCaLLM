{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as multiple small tissue cylinders are described
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" as the conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is determined from the most severe sample (Sample 1 and 2). Sample 1 has Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%), Sample 2 has Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (<35%). I chose the most severe pattern combination of 4+3=7, which represents the primary (4) and secondary (3) Gleason patterns.
