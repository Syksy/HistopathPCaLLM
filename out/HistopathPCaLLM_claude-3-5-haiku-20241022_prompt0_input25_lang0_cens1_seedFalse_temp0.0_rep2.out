{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being examined.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the conclusion explicitly states that the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant finding was made.
