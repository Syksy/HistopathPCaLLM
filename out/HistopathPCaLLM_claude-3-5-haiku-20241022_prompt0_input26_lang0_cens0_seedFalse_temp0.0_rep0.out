{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description of a "prostatectomy preparate"
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to the description of a "widely spread tumor"
- Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the statement indicates dominant Gleason class 3 with class 4 differentation being almost as prevalent
