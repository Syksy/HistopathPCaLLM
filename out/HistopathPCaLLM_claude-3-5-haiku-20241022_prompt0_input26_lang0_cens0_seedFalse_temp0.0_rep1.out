{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" due to explicit mention of "widely spread tumor"
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the statement indicates dominant Gleason is class 3, with class 4 differentiation being almost as prevalent, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
