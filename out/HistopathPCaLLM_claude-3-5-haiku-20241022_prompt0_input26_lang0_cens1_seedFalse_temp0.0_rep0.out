{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples (A-F) from different prostate regions.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the histopathology is deemed unassessable due to recent radiation therapy.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because while a clinical note mentions a possible Gleason sum of 7, the pathologist explicitly states the histology cannot be reasonably assessed.
