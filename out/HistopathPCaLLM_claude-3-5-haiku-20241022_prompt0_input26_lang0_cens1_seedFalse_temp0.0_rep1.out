{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: This appears to be a biopsy sample, as multiple samples from different prostate regions (apex and basis) are mentioned.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: Cannot be definitively determined due to recent radiation therapy making histological assessment difficult. Hence marked as "NA".
3. Gleason Grade: While clinical notes mention a possible "Gleason sum 7", the pathologist explicitly states the histopathology cannot be reasonably assessed due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
