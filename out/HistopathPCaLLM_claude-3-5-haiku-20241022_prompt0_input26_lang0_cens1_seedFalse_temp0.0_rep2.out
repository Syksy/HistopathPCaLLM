{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: This appears to be a biopsy based on the description of multiple samples (indices A-C for apex, D-F for basis) and the detailed histological examination.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement is inconclusive due to recent radiation therapy, which makes histological assessment difficult. Therefore, "NA" is the most appropriate response.
3. Gleason Grade: While clinical notes mention a possible "Gleason sum 7", the pathologist explicitly states that the histopathology cannot be reasonably assessed due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, "NA" is the most appropriate response.
