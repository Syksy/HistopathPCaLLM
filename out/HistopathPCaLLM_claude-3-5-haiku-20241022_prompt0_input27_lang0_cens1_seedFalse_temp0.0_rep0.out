{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being examined
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" since the statement mentions potential tumor growth patterns
3. Gleason grade is "3+3=6" as the statement suggests a possible Gleason score of 3, with the most conservative interpretation being a symmetric 3+3 pattern
