{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first sentence ("six biopsy cylinders")
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to multiple adenocarcinoma descriptions
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as this is the highest grade malignant finding (from focus #1), matching the summary statement about the "highest grade malignant finding"
