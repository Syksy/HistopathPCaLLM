{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: This appears to be a biopsy, as multiple "regions of interest" were examined from different sites, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While there are "atypical growth patterns" and "possible pre-malignant changes", no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed in the statement. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The structured response captures the key characteristics of the pathological statement while adhering to the specified JSON format and allowed values.
