{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the detailed description of multiple planes and lobes being sampled, and the comprehensive nature of the specimen.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of invasive adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the summary indicates a Gleason score sum of 7, with the description noting "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" (primary grade 4) and a "smaller portion" suggesting a secondary grade 3.
