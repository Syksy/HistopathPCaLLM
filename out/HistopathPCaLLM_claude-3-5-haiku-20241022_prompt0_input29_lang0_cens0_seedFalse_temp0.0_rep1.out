{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the detailed description of multiple lobar samples and the comprehensive examination.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of invasive adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as stated in the summary, with the primary (major) grade being 4 and the secondary (minor) grade being 3, totaling a Gleason score of 7.
