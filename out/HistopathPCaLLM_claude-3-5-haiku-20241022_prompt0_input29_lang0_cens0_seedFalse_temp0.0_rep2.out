{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the detailed description of multiple planes and lobes, and the comprehensive sampling of the prostate.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of invasive adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the summary indicates a Gleason score sum of 7, with the text specifying "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" (primary grade 4) and a "smaller portion" suggesting secondary grade 3.
