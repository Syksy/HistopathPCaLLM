{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: This appears to be a biopsy based on the description of multiple tissue samples (A-F) being taken from different prostate locations.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement indicates that a definitive assessment could not be made. The samples A and C were non-prostatic and the colleague requested re-examination. Therefore, the malignant tumor finding is "NA".
3. Gleason Grade: The summary explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible", so the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Multiple samples were taken
- Samples A and C were non-prostatic
- No definitive tumor assessment was possible
- Re-examination was recommended
