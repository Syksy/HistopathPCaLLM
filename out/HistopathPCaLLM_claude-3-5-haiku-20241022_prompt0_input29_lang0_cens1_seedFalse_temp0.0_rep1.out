{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: This appears to be a biopsy based on the description of multiple tissue samples (A-F) being taken from different prostate locations.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement indicates that the samples A and C were non-prostatic and inconclusive, and a definitive tumor assessment was not possible. Therefore, the result is "NA".
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive tumor assessment was made and the samples were deemed insufficient, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "From sample indices A and C non-prostatic tissue is observed"
- "Capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed"
- "Score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined"
