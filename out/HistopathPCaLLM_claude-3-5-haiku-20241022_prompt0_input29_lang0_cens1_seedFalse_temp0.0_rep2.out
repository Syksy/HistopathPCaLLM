{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being taken from different prostate locations.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement indicates that the samples were inconclusive and need re-examination, with no definitive tumor assessment.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as the summary explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible" and the samples need to be re-examined.
