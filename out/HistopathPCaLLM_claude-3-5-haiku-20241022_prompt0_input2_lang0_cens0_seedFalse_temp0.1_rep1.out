{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the statement "fresh prostatectomy specimen"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the summary indicates no tumor growth and describes only benign changes
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
