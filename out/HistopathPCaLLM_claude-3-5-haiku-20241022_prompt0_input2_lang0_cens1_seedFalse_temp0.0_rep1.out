{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement indicates this is an autopsy specimen, but does not specify a standard prostate sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While the summary mentions potential adenocarcinoma, the statement explicitly notes that reliable findings cannot be inferred, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason Grade: No definitive Gleason grade can be determined from this statement, so "NA" is used.

The key points supporting this interpretation are the statements about inflammatory changes, age-related changes, and the need for further inspection, which prevent a clear determination of malignancy or grading.
