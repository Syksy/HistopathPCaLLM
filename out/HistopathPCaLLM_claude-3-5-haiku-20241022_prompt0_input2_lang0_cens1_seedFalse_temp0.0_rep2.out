{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because the statement indicates this is an autopsy specimen for research, not a standard clinical biopsy or procedure sample
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because while potential adenocarcinoma is mentioned, no definitive malignancy is confirmed
- Gleason grade is "NA" due to lack of a clear malignant diagnosis and inconclusive findings

The statement suggests further investigation is needed and the current sample cannot reliably characterize potential malignancy.
