{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement indicates this is an autopsy specimen, but does not specify a standard prostate sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While the summary mentions potential adenocarcinoma, the statement explicitly notes that reliable findings cannot be inferred, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason Grade: No definitive Gleason grade can be determined from this statement, so "NA" is used.

The key points supporting this interpretation are the phrases "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and "samples can be only marginally utilized", which indicate insufficient information to make a definitive diagnostic assessment.
