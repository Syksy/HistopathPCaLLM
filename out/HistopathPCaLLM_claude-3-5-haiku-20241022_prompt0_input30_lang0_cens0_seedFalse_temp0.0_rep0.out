{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: No clear indication of specific sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP), so "NA"
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: Confirmed "yes" due to mention of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason Grade: Explicitly stated as primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4, which translates to "3+4=7"

The key details supporting this interpretation are:
- "diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3"
- "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3)"
- Updated from previous uncertain diagnosis to a more definitive Gleason grade
