{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement appears to be a consultation note about diagnostic uncertainty
- There are no clear definitive statements about prostate cancer
- No specific sample type is mentioned
- No confirmation of malignant tumor findings
- No Gleason grade can be determined from this text
- All fields are therefore marked as "NA"
