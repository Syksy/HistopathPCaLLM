{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" (specifically targeted biopsy)
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" (multiple references to tumor)
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on:
   - Primary pattern is 4
   - Secondary pattern is described as 5
   - This represents the most severe lesion found
   - The statement explicitly notes that the previous Gleason 3+3=6 did not capture the most aggressive tumor characteristics
