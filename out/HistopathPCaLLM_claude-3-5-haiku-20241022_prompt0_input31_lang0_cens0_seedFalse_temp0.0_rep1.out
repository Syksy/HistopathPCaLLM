{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the text mentioning "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies"
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to clear description of tumor foci
- Gleason grade is "4+5=9" because the text describes a primary pattern of 4 and a secondary pattern of 5, which represents the most severe lesion, overriding the initial Gleason 3+3=6 finding
