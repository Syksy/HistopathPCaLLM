{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to the presence of tumor foci and Gleason grading
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the description of primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, which represents the most severe lesion found in the second targeted biopsy
