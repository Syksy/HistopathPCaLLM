{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement indicates samples were taken, which suggests a "biopsy"
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While there are "suspicious findings", they are only in 5% of samples and the interpretation is unclear. The statement does not definitively confirm malignancy, so the answer is "no"
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, the grade is marked as "NA"
