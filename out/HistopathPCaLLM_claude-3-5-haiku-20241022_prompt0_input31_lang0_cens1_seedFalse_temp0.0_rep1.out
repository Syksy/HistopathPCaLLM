{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of samples being taken for investigation
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because:
   - Findings are described as "suspicious" but not definitively malignant
   - Only 5% of samples show suspicious characteristics
   - The interpretation is inconclusive and additional samples are needed
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor was confirmed
