{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the statement's first sentence.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the statement mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate".
3. The Gleason grade is "4+4=8", which is the most severe pattern mentioned in the statement (specifically noted "Gleason 4+4 pattern was observed particularly in the base of the prostate").
