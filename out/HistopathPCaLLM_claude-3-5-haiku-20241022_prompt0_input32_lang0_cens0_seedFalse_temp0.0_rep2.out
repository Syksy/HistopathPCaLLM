{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the statement's first sentence.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the statement mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate".
3. The most severe Gleason grade reported is "4+4=8", which appears in the description of the prostate base's tumor pattern.
