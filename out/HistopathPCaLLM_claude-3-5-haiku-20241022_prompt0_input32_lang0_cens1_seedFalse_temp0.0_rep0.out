Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: "no" because the summary indicates lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, with no explicit mention of a malignant tumor
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" since no malignant findings were reported
