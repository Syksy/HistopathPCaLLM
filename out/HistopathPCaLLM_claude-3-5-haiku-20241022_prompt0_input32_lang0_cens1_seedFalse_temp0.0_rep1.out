Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is clearly identified in the text.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: "no" because the statement indicates that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, suggesting no malignant findings.
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" because no specific Gleason grading is mentioned and the findings appear to be negative for malignancy.
