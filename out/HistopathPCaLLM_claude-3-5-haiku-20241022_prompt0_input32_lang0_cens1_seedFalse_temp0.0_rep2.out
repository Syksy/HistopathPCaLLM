Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" - The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP)
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: "no" - The summary indicates lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, suggesting no malignant findings
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" - No specific Gleason grading is mentioned, and the findings appear to be negative for cancer
