{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the first sentence
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of tumor penetrating capsule and Gleason grade variations
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on the statement "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3", with the most severe pattern being 4+3
