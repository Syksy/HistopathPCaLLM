{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the first sentence.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit description of tumor growth, capsule penetration, and lymph node involvement.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the statement indicates varying growth patterns of Gleason types 3+4 and 4+3, with the more severe pattern (4+3) being selected.
