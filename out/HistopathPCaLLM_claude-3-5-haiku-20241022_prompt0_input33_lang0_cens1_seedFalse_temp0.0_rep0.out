Based on the provided pathology statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" - No specific sample type is clearly identified in the statement.
2. Malignant Tumor: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles".
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" - Since no malignant tumor was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The response follows the specified JSON structure and uses the allowed values for each field, focusing on the most severe (in this case, benign) findings.
