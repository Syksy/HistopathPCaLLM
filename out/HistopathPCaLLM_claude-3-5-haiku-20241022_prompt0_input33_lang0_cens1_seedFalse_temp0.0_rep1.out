Based on the provided pathology statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: Cannot be definitively determined from the text, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignant Tumor: Explicitly stated "No malignant findings", so marked as "no"
3. Gleason Grade: No malignant tumor detected, so marked as "NA"

The response follows the specified JSON structure and uses the allowed values for each field, focusing on the most severe (in this case, non-existent) lesion.
