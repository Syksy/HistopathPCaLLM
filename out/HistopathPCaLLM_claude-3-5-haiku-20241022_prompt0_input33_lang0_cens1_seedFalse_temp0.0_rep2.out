{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: Cannot be definitively determined from the text, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: Explicitly stated "No malignant findings", so marked as "no"
3. Gleason Grade: No malignant tumor detected, so marked as "NA"

The text appears to be a general description of sample processing with no clear indication of a specific prostate cancer diagnosis. The statement mentions "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm a malignant tumor, and specifically notes "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles".
