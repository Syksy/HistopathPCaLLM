{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of a resection specimen
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly says "no malignities" and "findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
