{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of a resection sample
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly says "no malignities" and "findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
