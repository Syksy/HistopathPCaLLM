{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" and describes hyperplastic tissue
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
