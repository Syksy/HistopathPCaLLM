{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of tissue casettes and sample preparation
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" and describes hyperplastic tissue
3. Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
