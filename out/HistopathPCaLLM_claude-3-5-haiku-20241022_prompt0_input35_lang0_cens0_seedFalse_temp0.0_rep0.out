{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found, and the only noted finding was a small high-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) which is not considered a malignant tumor
