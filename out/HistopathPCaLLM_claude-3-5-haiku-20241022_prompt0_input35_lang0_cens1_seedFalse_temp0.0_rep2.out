{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of samples from left and right lobes
2. No malignant tumor is found - the statement mentions high-grade PIN changes and hyperplasia, but does not confirm cancer
3. Since no malignant tumor is found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
