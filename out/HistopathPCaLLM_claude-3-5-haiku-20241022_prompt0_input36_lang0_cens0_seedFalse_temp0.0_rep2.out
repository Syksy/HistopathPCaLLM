{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a specific sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement explicitly states "No signs of malignity", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason grade is "NA".
