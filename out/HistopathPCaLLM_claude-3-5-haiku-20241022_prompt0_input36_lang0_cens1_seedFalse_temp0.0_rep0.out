{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because no specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
- Malignant tumor is "no" because the statement describes benign findings (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia)
- Gleason grade is "NA" as there are no malignant findings
