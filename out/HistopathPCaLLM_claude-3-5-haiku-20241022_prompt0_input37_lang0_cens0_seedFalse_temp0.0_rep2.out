{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the text mentions "electrosection chippings", which is typical of a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. Malignant tumor is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (benign condition) and no malignancy is mentioned.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no cancer was found and the statement describes a benign condition.
