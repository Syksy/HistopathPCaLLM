{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the statement suggests a partial sample examination
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because no definitive malignancy is confirmed in the statement
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the examination and statement that further examination is pending
