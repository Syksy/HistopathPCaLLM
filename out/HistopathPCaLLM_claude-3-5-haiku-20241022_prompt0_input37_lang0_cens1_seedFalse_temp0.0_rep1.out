{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the statement suggests a partial sample examination
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because no definitive malignancy is confirmed in the statement
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to incomplete examination and inconclusive findings

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- "Less than half of the total sample material preparated"
- "Further examination was not possible at this time"
- No clear confirmation of cancer or specific tumor grading
