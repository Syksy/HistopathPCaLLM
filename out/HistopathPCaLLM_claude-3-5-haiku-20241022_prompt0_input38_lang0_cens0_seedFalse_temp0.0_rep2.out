{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the text "Representative needle biopsies as samples"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the text explicitly states "No suspected malignity"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
