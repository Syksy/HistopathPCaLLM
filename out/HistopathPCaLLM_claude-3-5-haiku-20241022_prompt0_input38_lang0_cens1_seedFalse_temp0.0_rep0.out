{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type is mentioned
- Malignant tumor is "no" because the statement describes hyperplastic prostate tissue and chronic inflammation, which are benign findings
- Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
