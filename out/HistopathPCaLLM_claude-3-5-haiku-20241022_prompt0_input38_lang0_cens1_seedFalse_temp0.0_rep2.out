{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type is mentioned
2. Malignant tumor is "no" because the statement describes hyperplastic prostate tissue and chronic inflammation, which are benign findings
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
