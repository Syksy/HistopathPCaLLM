{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" due to explicit mention of tumor with multiple foci
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as directly stated in the text, with 3 as the major grade and 4 as the minor grade
