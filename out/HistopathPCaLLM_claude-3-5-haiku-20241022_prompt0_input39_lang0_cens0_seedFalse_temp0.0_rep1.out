{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" due to the description of tumor foci and Gleason grading
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as explicitly stated in the text, with 3 being the primary (major) grade and 4 being the secondary (minor) grade
