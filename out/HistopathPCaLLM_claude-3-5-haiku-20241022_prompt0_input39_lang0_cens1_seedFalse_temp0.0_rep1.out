{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of extracted slices and microscopic inspection.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says it is unclear whether there are malignant findings, and no definitive malignancy is reported.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement indicates that Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point.
