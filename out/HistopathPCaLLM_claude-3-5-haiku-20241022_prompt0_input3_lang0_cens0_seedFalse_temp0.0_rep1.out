{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
