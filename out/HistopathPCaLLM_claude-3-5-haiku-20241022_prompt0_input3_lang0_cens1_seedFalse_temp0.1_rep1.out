{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: Cannot definitively determine the specific type of sample, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: No malignant tumor is reported; the statement mentions inflammation but explicitly states nothing conclusive could be derived
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor was found, marked as "NA"
