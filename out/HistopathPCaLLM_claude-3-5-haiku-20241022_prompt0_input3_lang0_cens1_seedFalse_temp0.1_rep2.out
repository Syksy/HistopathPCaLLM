{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: Cannot definitively determine from the text, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: No malignant tumor is reported; the text mentions only inflammation and burn artifacts
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor is found, marked as "NA"

The text describes a prostate sample with inflammation and burn artifacts that prevent a conclusive examination, but does not indicate the presence of a malignant tumor.
