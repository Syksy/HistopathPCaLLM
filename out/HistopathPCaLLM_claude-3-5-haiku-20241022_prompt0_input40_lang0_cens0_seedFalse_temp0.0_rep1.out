{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of shaving material and procedure
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the summary explicitly states "Benign prostate hyperplasia"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and this is a benign tissue sample
