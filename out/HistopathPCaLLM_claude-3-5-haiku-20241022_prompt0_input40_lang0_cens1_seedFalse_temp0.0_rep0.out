{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used
- There are no definitive malignant tumor findings mentioned
- No Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used
- The text suggests only hyperplastic prostate and inflammation, which are non-malignant findings
