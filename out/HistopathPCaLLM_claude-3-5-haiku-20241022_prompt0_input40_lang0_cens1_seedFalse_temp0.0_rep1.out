{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used
- There are no definitive malignant tumor findings mentioned, so "no" is selected
- No Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used
- The text suggests hyperplastic prostate and inflammation, but no confirmed malignancy
