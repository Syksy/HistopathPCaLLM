{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used
- The statement mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, but no definitive malignant tumor is described, so "no" is used for malignant tumor findings
- No Gleason grade is applicable, so "NA" is used
