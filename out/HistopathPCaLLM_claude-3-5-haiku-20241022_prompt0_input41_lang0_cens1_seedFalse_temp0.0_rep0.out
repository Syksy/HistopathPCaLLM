{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since multiple samples were collected from prostate lobes
2. No malignant tumor findings are reported; the statement indicates difficulty in determining cancer-related changes
3. Since no cancer is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
