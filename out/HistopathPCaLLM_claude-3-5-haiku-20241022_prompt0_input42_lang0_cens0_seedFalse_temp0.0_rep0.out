{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. "Prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen
2. The description includes malignant tumor findings with Gleason grading
3. The summary explicitly states the Gleason score as 7, with primary grade 4 and secondary grade 3
