{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of a "prostate sample"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says cancer cannot be determined
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive cancer diagnosis was made
