{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
