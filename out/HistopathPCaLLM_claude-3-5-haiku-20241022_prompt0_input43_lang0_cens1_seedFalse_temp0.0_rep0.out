{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Approx 30g prostate samples"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no cancer was identified
