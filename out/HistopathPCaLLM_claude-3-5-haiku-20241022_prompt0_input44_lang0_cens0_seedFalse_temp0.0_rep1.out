{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first line
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the summary indicates "no tumor tissue can be seen"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no current tumor is present, despite previous cancer history
