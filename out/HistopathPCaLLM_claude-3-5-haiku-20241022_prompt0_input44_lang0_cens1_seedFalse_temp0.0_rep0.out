{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the statement mentioning "biopsies" and "prostate samples"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the current statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no current malignant tumor is identified in this sample, despite previous reports of prostate cancer
