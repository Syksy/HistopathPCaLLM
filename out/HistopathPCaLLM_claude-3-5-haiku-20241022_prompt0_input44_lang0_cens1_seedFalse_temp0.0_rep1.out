{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the statement mentioning "biopsies" and the context of the histopathological examination.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the current statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found in this current sample, despite a note about earlier biopsies reporting prostate cancer.
