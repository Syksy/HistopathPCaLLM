{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description of a "whole prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to the description of tumor tissue focus
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as explicitly stated in the text that gland structures are in "classes 3+4" and tissue Gleason is 3, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
