{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description of a whole prostatectomy preparate
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to the description of tumor tissue focus
- Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as explicitly stated in the text (most severe lesion classes 3+4)
