{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because it appears to be a prostate sample with multiple sections (E, F, G) and a small tissue focus being examined.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the statement mentions a "suspect prostate sample" with a "fusing tissue focus" where "most of gland structures and canals are separated".
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because while there are suspicious findings, the statement explicitly notes that the "structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "further inspection is needed", so a definitive Gleason grade cannot be assigned.
