Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


A suspect prostate sample, processed according to the routine. Sample material from the middle (E, F, G) form a fusing tissue focus (size approx 3x2x1mm). In focus, most of gland structures and canals are separated. Seminal vesicles in sections O and P are clean. Negative marginals, capsel intact. No metastases seen in lymph nodes in the area. However, the structure is unclear and not able to detect. Further inspection is needed.
