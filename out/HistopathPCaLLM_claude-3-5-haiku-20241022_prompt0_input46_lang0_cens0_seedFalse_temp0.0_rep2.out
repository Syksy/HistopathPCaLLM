{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" based on the description of "shaved prostate chippings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no cancer was found
