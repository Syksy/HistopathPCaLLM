{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of prostate material being processed
2. No malignant tumor findings are reported; the statement mentions only regular prostate tissue and possible basal cell hyperplasia
3. The pathologist explicitly states they are "not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes", so Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
