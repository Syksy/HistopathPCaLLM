{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of prostate material being processed.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement indicates regular prostate tissue and inability to definitively confirm cancer-related changes.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was confirmed.
