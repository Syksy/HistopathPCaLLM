{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of examined prostatic material
2. No malignant tumor findings are reported; the statement explicitly says they are "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings"
3. Since no malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
