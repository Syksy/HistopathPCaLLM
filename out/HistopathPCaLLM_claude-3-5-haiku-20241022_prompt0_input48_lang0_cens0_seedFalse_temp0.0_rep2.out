{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a prostate resection weighing 100g
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" due to the explicit finding of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" as stated in the summary, which represents the most severe lesion (Gleason 9 tumor)
