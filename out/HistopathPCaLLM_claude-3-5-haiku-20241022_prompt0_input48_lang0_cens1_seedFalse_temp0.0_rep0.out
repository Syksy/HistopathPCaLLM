{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes an autopsy sample, which does not fit the standard biopsy/RP/TURP categories, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The summary explicitly states that no differentiation scores are being derived, and no clear malignant tumor is described, so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: The text specifically mentions that Gleason scores (1-5) are not being used for this demonstration, so "NA" is appropriate.
