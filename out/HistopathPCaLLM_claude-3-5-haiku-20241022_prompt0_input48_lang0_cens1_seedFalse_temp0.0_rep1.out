{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes an autopsy sample, which does not match the standard clinical sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The summary explicitly states that this is not used to derive differentiation scores, and no clear malignant tumor is described, so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: The text mentions "Gleason 1-5" in a context of not deriving scores, so "NA" is appropriate.
