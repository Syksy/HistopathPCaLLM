{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" since the statement mentions "5 shavings contained carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the most common Gleason class is 3 and the second most common is 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 7
