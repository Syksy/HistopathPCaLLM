{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the text mentions "prostate chippings" which typically refers to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because the statement explicitly mentions that 5 shavings contained carcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the text indicates the most common Gleason class is 3 and the second most common is 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
