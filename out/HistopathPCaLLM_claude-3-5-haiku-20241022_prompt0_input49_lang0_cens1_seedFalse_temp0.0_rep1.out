{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the statement mentions investigating prostate samples across multiple glasses, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because while some changes were noted that warrant further investigation, no definitive malignant tumor was confirmed due to technical limitations.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no conclusive malignant finding was established.
