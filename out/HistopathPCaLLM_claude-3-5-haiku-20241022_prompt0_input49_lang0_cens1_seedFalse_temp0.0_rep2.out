{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the statement mentions investigating prostate samples across multiple glasses, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant tumor is "NA" because while there are mentioned "changes that warrant further investigation", no definitive malignant tumor finding is confirmed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a confirmed malignant diagnosis and the statement that further assessment is not possible due to technical limitations.
