{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly says "the samples do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
