{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple sampling sites and tissue sampling.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement explicitly notes no notable atypic patterns and insufficient material to confirm adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of confirmed malignancy and insufficient sample material to grade.
