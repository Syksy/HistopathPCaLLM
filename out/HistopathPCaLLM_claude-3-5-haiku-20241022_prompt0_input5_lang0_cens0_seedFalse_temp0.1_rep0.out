{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the first sentence
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to explicit statement of "cancerous tissue is observed"
- Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the description of macro B showing the most severe lesion with architecture 4+5 and sum of 9
