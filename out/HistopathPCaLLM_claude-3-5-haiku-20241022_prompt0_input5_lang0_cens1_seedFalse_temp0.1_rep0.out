{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes a biopsy with samples taken from different parts of the prostate (apex and basis), so "biopsy" is the appropriate classification.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement explicitly mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed" and that Gleason classes could not be inferred, suggesting no clear malignant tumor was found. Therefore, "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor was definitively identified, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The key phrases supporting these choices include:
- "Samples taken from both apex and basis" → indicates biopsy
- "Microscopically clear prostate tissue" → suggests no malignant finding
- "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred" → supports "NA" for Gleason grade
