{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes a biopsy with multiple sections taken from different parts of the prostate (apex and basis), so "biopsy" is the appropriate sample type.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The text explicitly states "Microscopically clear prostate tissue" and mentions that Gleason classes could not be inferred, suggesting no clear malignant tumor was found. Therefore, "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor was definitively identified, "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.

The key phrases supporting these choices include:
- "Samples taken from both apex and basis" → indicates biopsy
- "Microscopically clear prostate tissue" → suggests no malignant findings
- "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred" → supports "NA" for Gleason grade
