{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text describes a prostate biopsy with samples taken from different sections (apex and basis), so "biopsy" is the appropriate classification.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The text explicitly states "Microscopically clear prostate tissue" and mentions that Gleason classes could not be definitively inferred, suggesting no clear malignant tumor.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
