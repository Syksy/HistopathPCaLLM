{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "shaving chips" and multiple tissue cassettes
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement describes benign prostate hyperplasia
3. Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason grade is "NA"
