{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of "prostatic operation material"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the results are described as inconclusive and no definitive tumor is mentioned
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the examination and inability to fully inspect the sample
