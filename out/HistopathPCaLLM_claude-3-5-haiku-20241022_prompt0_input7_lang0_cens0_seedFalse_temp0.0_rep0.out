{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor is "yes" because the text mentions "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma", even though the finding is small and not conclusive
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because while there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, no definitive Gleason score is provided, and the finding is described as inconclusive
