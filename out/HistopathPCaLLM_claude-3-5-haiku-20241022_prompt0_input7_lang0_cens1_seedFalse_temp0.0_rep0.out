Based on the provided histopathological statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "biopsy" - The statement describes a prostate sample collection typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor: "no" - The statement indicates that while there were some atypical structures, no definite malignant conclusion could be drawn, and the finding was "diminishingly small".
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" - Since no definitive malignant finding was confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
