Based on the provided histopathological statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "biopsy" - The statement describes a prostate sample collection typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor: "no" - The statement indicates that while there were some atypical structures, no definite malignant findings were conclusively identified. The finding was described as "diminishingly small" and no definitive conclusion was drawn.
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" - Since no definitive malignant tumor was identified, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
