Based on the provided histopathological statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "biopsy" is selected as the statement describes a prostate sample collection.
2. Malignant Tumor: "no" is selected because the statement mentions that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the atypical structures were "diminishingly small".
3. Gleason Grade: "NA" is appropriate since no definitive malignancy was confirmed.
