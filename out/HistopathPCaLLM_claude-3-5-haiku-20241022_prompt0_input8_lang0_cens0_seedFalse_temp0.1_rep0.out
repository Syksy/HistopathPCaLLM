{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Key reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the text
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to tumor tissue being observed with invasive properties
- Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly reported in the statement, with pattern 4 being the primary (major) grade and pattern 3 being the secondary (minor) grade
