{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", 
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Key reasoning steps:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" due to tumor tissue being observed in both lobes with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly reported in the statement, with the highest identified Gleason growth pattern being 4+3=7
