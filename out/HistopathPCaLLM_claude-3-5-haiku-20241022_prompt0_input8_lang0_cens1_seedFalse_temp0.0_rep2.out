{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple segments and samples.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as the statement explicitly confirms that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings".
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor was identified, and the text mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and no grade score was reported.
