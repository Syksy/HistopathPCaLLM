{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The description mentions "electrosection shavings" which is characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings are observed" and describes benign hyperplasia.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignant tumor was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
