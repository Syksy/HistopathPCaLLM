{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "electrosection shavings"
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" as explicitly stated in the text: "No malignant findings are observed"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found, and the findings are described as benign hyperplasia
