{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: No specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement indicates that "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and no definitive malignancy is reported, so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignancy is found and the findings are inconclusive, "NA" is used.

The structured response follows the specified JSON format and addresses the three key questions based on the provided histopathological statement.
