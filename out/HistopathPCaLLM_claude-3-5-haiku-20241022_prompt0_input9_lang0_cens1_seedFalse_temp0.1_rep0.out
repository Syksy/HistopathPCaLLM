{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of obtaining sample material and processing it for histological examination.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" because the statement indicates the epithelial cell lining appears normal and no definitive tumor is described.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was identified and the conclusions were inconclusive.
