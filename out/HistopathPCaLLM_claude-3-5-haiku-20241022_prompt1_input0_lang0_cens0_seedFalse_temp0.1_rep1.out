{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "chipping samples" and the volume of tissue.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "no malignancies, or carcinoma" and describes benign prostate tissue.
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason score is "NA".
