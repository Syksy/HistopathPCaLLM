{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Given the description of "Chipping samples" and the volume mentioned, this appears to be a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "no malignancies" and describes the tissue as benign, so the malignancy is "no".
3. Gleason score: Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
