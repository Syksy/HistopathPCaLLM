{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly states that no malignancy can be inferred.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason grading was possible.
