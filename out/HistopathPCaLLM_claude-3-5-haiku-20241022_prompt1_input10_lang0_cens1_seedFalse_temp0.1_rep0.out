{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
- Malignancy is "no" because the statement mentions "normal basal cells" and no definitive malignant tumor finding
- Gleason is "NA" since no Gleason grading is reported and the finding is benign
