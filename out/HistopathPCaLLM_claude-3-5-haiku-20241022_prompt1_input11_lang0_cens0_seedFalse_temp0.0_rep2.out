{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of "invasive tumor tissue"
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as explicitly stated in the text: "with a Gleason grading 4+3"
