{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of the statement describing a prepared sample of prostate tissue.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are observations about tissue structure, no definitive malignant tumor finding is reported. The statement mentions inability to reliably assess Gleason scores and an inconclusive evaluation.
3. Gleason score is "NA" due to the lack of a conclusive malignant finding and the statement that only 5% of the material could be investigated.
