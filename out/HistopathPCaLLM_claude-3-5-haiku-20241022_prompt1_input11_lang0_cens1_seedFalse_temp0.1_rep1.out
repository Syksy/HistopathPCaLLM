{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of the statement describing a prepared sample of prostate tissue.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are observations about tissue structure, no definitive malignant tumor finding is reported. The statement explicitly mentions that Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed.
3. Gleason is "NA" due to the inability to conclusively assess the Gleason score, with only 5% of the material investigated.
