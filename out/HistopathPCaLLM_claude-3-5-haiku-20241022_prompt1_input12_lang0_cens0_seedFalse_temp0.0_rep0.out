{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate", which is most consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states that the material is "classified as benign", so the malignancy is "no".
3. Gleason score: Since the sample is benign, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
