Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: Cannot be definitively determined from the text. The statement mentions a "prostate cancer tissue" sample but does not specify the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: While "prostate cancer tissue" is mentioned, there's insufficient clear confirmation of malignancy. The text suggests the sample is being processed but doesn't provide a definitive malignancy assessment. Thus, "NA" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No specific Gleason grading is provided in the text. The statement only mentions the sample is in process with images pending. Therefore, "NA" is used.
