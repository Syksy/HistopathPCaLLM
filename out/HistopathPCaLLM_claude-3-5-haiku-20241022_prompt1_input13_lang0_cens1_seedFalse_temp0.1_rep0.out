Based on the provided statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" because the text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate"
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are some suspicious patterns noted, no definitive malignancy is confirmed, and the statement suggests further consultation is needed
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy is confirmed and no specific Gleason grade is mentioned
