{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "prostatetectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma"
3. Gleason score is "3+4=7" - the statement indicates the larger portion is score 3 (approximately 60%), which suggests a Gleason pattern of 3 as the primary (major) grade, and pattern 4 as the secondary (minor) grade, totaling 7
