{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "prostatetectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the observation of "tumorous growth"
3. Gleason score is "3+4=7" as the statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings" - this suggests a Gleason pattern of 3 (primary) and 4 (secondary)
