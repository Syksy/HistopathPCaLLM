{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA", 
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The text appears to be a detailed description of a histopathological examination, but does not definitively state a malignant finding
- No clear sample type is specified (mentions multiple sample batches but not a definitive type)
- While a Gleason 7 score is mentioned in reference to another patient, it is not directly attributed to this patient's sample
- The text suggests further investigation is needed and no conclusive diagnosis is made
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" based on the available information
