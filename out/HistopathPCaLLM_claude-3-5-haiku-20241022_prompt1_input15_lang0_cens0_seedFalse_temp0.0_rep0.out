{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "Prostate chippings" which indicates a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the text explicitly states "confirm adenocarcinoma".
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" because the text indicates Gleason 4 is the most represented grade, and the sum of the grades is 8.
