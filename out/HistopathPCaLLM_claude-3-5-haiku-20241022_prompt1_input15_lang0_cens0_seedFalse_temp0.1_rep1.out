{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is confirmed
3. Gleason score is "4+4=8" as the statement indicates Gleason 4 is most represented, and the sum is 8
