{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA", 
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is not explicitly specified, so marked as "NA"
- Malignancy is uncertain - the text mentions a suspected adenocarcinoma but explicitly states that no definitive Gleason grade or marker could be determined
- No confirmed Gleason grade is present, so marked as "NA"
- The statement indicates that further examination is needed to confirm or discard the initial suspicion
