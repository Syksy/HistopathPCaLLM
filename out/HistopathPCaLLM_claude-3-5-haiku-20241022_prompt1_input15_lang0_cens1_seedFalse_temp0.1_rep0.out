{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA", 
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- Sample type is "NA" because no specific type of prostate sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is definitively mentioned
- Malignancy is "NA" because while there is a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, no definitive confirmation is made in the histopathological statement
- Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement explicitly notes that a representative Gleason grade could not be determined at this time, despite clinical notes suggesting a potential high-grade suspicion

The key points are the lack of definitive histopathological confirmation and the explicit statement that Gleason grading could not be determined in this examination.
