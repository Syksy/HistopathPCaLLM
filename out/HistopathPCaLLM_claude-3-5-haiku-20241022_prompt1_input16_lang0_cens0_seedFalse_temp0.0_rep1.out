{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the text mentions "three fusion biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma foci are detected
3. Gleason score is "3+4=7" based on the conclusion statement that describes Gleason architecture as 3 covering approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covering approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma part, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
