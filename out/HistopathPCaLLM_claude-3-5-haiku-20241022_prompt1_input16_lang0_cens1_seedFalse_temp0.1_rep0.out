{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate", which suggests a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The text indicates suspicious foci and mentions cell differentiation patterns, suggesting the presence of a malignant finding.
3. Gleason grade: The statement explicitly notes that explicit Gleason scoring is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and recommends manual grading. Therefore, "NA" is the appropriate response.

The structured response follows the specified JSON format and captures the key information from the pathological statement.
