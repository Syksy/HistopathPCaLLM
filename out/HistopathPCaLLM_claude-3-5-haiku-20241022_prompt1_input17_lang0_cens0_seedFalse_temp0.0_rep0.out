{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to multiple clear tumor foci and detailed description of tumor characteristics
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3"

The structured data captures the key diagnostic information from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as instructed.
