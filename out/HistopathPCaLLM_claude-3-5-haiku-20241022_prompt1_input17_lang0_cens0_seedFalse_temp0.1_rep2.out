{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to multiple clear tumor foci being described
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3"
