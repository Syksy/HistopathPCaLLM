{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The text appears to be a procedural description of sample processing and preparation
- There is no definitive statement about a malignant tumor finding
- No specific Gleason grade is mentioned
- The sample type is not explicitly stated
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (not available)
