{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma is detected
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description that the tumor has a Gleason sum of 7, with the larger fraction (60%) being grade 3, which implies a 3+4 pattern
