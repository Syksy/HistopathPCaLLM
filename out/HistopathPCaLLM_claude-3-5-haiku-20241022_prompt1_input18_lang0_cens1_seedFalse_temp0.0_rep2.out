{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates that >95% of material appears benign, and the suspicious focus is too small to definitively classify
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor was confirmed, and the suspicious focus was too small to assign a grade group
