{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first line of the text
2. Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is detected in sample 4
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of the tumor composition (90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4), with the more significant grade listed first according to standard notation
