{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is detected in sample 4
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%) components, with the standard reporting convention of listing the primary (most common) grade first
