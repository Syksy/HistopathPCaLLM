{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue" and multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions samples 1-3 are benign, and sample 4 is uncertain and requires further verification.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no definitive malignant finding is reported, and the sample requires further investigation.
