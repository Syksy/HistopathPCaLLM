{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue" and multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly notes samples 1-3 are benign, and sample 4 is uncertain and requires further verification.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no definitive malignant finding was reported.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Samples 2 and 3 are described as "healthy benign prostate tissue"
- Sample 4 is uncertain and requires further lab verification
- No confirmed malignant tumor is identified in the statement
