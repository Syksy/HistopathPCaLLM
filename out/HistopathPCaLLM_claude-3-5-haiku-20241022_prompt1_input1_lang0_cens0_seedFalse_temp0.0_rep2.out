{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the text ("12 representative needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is "no" because the conclusion states "only benign-like growth is observed"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
