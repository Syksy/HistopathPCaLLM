{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of "prostate cancer samples" and standard location sampling.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement explicitly notes the results are "inconclusive" and no definitive malignancy is confirmed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since the findings are subjective and additional inspection is required, with no clear Gleason score determined.

The structured response follows the specified JSON format and captures the uncertainty in the pathological statement.
