{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of "prostate cancer samples" and standard location sampling.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement explicitly notes the results are "inconclusive" and no definitive malignancy is confirmed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since the findings are described as subjective and requiring additional inspection, with no specific Gleason grade mentioned.
