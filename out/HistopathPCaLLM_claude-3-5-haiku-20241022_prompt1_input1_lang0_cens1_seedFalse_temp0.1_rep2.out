{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of "prostate cancer samples from standard locations"
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the results are described as "inconclusive" and no definitive malignancy is confirmed
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since the findings are not conclusive and no specific Gleason score is reported
