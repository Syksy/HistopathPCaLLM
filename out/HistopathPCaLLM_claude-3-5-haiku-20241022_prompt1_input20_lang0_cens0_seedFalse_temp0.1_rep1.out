{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to adenocarcinoma being detected
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" based on the description of the basis presenting "mostly with class 4+4", which represents the most severe lesion in the statement. Although the apex shows 3+4, the basis lesion with 4+4 is more severe and thus takes precedence.
