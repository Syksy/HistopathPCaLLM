{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to adenocarcinoma being detected
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" based on the statement about the basis presenting "mostly with class 4+4", which represents the most severe lesion in this case (compared to the 3+4 at the apex)
