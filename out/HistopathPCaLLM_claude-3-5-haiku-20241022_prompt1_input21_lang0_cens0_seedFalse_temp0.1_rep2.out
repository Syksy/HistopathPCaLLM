{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "Prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of tumor-like tissue and poorly differentiated growth
3. Gleason grade is based on the most severe lesion, which is the most common Gleason grading of 5, with the second most common being 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is represented as 5+4=9.
