{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement describes a prostate biopsy sample (multiple fragments extracted)
- The sample appears to have technical issues with tissue quality that prevent definitive assessment
- No clear malignancy is confirmed
- Due to poor tissue quality, no Gleason grade can be determined
- Therefore, I've used "NA" for malignancy and Gleason grade, with "biopsy" as the sample type
