{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement describes a prostate sample (likely a biopsy based on the description of "extracted prostate material" and "fragments")
- The sample appears to be of poor quality with technical issues that prevent definitive assessment
- No clear malignancy is confirmed
- Due to the technical limitations, no Gleason grade can be determined
- Therefore, I've used "NA" for Malignancy and Gleason grade, and "biopsy" for sample type
