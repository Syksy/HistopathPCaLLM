{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the text
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma tissue structures are detected in the left side fragments
3. Gleason score is "3+4=7" based on the description of low grade differentiation with Gleason scores of 3 and 4, with the primary (first) grade being 3 and secondary (second) grade being 4
