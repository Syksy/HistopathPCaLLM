{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue sampling material"
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement explicitly says the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies"
3. Gleason is "NA" as the pathologist found it impossible to assign a Gleason grade due to sample fragmentation and variability
