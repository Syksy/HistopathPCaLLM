{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "4+5=9" as the most severe component is grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%), with the Gleason score sum explicitly stated as 9 in the conclusion
