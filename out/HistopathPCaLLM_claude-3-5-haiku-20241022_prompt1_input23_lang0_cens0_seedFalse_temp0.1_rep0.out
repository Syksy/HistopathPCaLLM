{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence about "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "4+5=9" based on the conclusion stating "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5", with the most severe components being grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%)
