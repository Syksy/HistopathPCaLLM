Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed for further investigation (4 macro sections and the usual microscopic sections), which present an adenocarcinoma spanning from the mid section to the basis. Presents mainly differentation stage 4 (60%). The second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion) represents the poorly differentiated tumor component. Tertiary grade with the least area, class 3, is diminishingly small. The samples do not appear suggest capsule breach or positive margins. CONCLUSION: Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5.
