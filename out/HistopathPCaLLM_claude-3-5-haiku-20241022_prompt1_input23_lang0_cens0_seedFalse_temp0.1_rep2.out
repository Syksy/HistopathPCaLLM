{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence about "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is 9, with the most severe component being grade 4 (60% of tumor) and grade 5 (30% of tumor), which translates to a Gleason pattern of 4+5=9, matching the conclusion's Gleason-score sum of 9
