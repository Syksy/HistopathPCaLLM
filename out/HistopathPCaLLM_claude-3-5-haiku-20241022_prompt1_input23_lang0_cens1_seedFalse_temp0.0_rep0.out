{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not definitively confirm a malignant tumor finding
- The sample type is not clearly specified (could be a biopsy, but insufficient information to confirm)
- While there is a mention of potential Gleason 3 findings in a prior report, the current statement is inconclusive and recommends reprocessing the sample
- Therefore, I've used "NA" for all fields to reflect the uncertainty and lack of definitive diagnostic information
