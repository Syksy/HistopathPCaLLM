{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The text describes a sample investigation process but does not definitively confirm a malignant tumor finding
- No clear sample type is specified (could be a biopsy, but insufficient evidence)
- While there's a mention of potential Gleason 3 findings in a prior report, the current statement does not confirm a malignant diagnosis
- The conclusion suggests further investigation is needed, which implies no definitive malignancy at this stage
