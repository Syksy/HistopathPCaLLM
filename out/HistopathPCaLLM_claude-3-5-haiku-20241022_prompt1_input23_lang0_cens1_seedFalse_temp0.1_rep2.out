{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- The text describes a sample investigation process but does not definitively confirm a malignant tumor finding
- No clear sample type is specified (could be a biopsy, but not explicitly stated)
- While there is a mention of potential Gleason 3 findings, this is not a conclusive diagnosis
- The text suggests further investigation is needed, so a definitive classification cannot be made
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" to reflect the uncertainty in the pathological statement
