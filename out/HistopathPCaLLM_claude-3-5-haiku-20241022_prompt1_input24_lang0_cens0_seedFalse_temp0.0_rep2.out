{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" as specified in the text ("turp-chippings")
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the adenocarcinoma finding and Gleason grade
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as stated in the summary, representing the most severe lesion with equal primary and secondary grades
