{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" as specified in the text ("turp-chippings")
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the explicit mention of "adenocarcinoma" and "malignant suspicion"
3. Gleason score is "4+4=8" based on the summary statement mentioning "sum 8" and the description of "Gleason 4-class tumor growth"
