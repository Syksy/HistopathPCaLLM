{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as multiple tissue cylinders are described
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to explicit conclusion of "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason score is derived from Sample (1), which has the most severe lesion:
   - Gleason 4 pattern is 20%
   - Gleason 3 pattern is approximately 30%
   - This translates to a Gleason score of 4+3=7
   - Sample (2) has similar but slightly less extensive tumor, so Sample (1) is used
   - Sample (3) contains no abnormal tissue
