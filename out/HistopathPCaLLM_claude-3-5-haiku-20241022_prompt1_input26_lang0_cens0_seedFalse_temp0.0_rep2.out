{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of a "widely spread tumor"
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the statement indicates the dominant Gleason is class 3, with class 4 differentiation being almost as prevalent, which translates to a 3+4=7 Gleason score
