{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because the statement does not explicitly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP).
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma was histologically detected.
3. Gleason grade is "3+3=6" as stated in the text for the most severe lesion.
