{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of prostate tissue samples being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates that growth patterns did not follow normal tumor differentiation, and the potential Gleason score mention is tentative and not definitive
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no clear malignant finding was confirmed
