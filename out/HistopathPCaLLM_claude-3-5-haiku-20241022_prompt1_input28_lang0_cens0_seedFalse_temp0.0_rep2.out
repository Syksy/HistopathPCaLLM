{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

The structured data is based on the following reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to multiple adenocarcinoma findings
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as this represents the most severe lesion (Focus #1), which has the highest Gleason sum according to the summary statement
