{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text describes multiple regions of interest from a prostate tissue examination, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are atypical and pre-malignant changes mentioned, no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed in the statement.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor with specific Gleason grading is reported.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "six different sites of interest"
- "atypical growth patterns"
- "possible pre-malignant changes"
- "sent to pathologist for further evaluation"
- No conclusive statement of cancer is made
