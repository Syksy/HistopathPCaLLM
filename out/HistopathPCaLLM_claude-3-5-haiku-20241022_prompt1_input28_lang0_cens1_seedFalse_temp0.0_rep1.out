{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple sites of interest being examined, which is typical of a prostate biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are atypical and pre-malignant changes mentioned, no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed in the statement.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor with specific Gleason grading is reported.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "six different sites of interest"
- "atypical growth patterns"
- "possible pre-malignant changes"
- "sent to pathologist for further evaluation"
- No conclusive statement of cancer is made
