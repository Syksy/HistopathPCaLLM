{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the detailed description of a prostate specimen with multiple sections and weight measurement.
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the explicit description of invasive adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as stated in the summary, with the primary (major) grade being 4 and the secondary (minor) grade being 3, resulting in a total sum of 7.
