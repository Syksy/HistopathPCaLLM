{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being taken from different prostate locations.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement indicates that the samples could not be definitively assessed, with specific mention that "Score sum determination was not possible" and samples need to be re-examined.
3. Gleason score is "NA" due to the inability to conclusively determine tumor characteristics from the current samples.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Multiple tissue samples were taken
- Some samples were non-prostatic or contaminated
- Tumor cell assessment was not possible
- Further sampling is recommended
- No definitive malignancy or Gleason score could be determined
