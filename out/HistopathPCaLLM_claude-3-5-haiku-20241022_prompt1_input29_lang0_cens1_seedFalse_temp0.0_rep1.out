{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being taken from different prostate locations.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement indicates that the samples could not be definitively assessed, with non-prostatic tissue observed and a request for re-examination.
3. Gleason score is "NA" as the summary explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible" and the samples need to be re-examined.
