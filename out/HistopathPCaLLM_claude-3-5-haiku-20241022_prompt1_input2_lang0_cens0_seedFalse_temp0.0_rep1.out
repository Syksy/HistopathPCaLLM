{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "fresh prostatectomy specimen"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary indicates no tumor growth and describes only benign changes
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
