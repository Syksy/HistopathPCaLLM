{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not specified as a standard biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of prostate), so "NA" is used.
- The statement does not definitively confirm malignancy. While potential adenocarcinoma is mentioned, the summary suggests further investigation is needed, so "NA" is used.
- No definitive Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used.

The text describes an inconclusive research autopsy specimen with inflammatory changes and potential but unconfirmed malignant changes, requiring further investigation.
