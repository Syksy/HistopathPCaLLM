{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not clearly specified, so "NA" is used
- No definitive malignancy is confirmed in the statement
- No clear Gleason grade is reported
- The summary suggests inconclusive findings and the need for further investigation
- The text describes potential changes but does not definitively diagnose prostate cancer
