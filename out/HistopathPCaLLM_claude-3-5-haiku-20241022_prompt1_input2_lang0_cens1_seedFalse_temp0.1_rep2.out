{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not specified as a standard biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of prostate), so "NA" is used.
- The statement does not definitively confirm malignancy. While potential adenocarcinoma is mentioned, the summary indicates that further inspection is required and current samples cannot reliably characterize malignant changes.
- No specific Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used.

The text describes an inconclusive research autopsy specimen with inflammatory changes and insufficient information to make a definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer.
