{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: No clear indication of specific sample type, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignancy: Confirmed by mention of "adenocarcinoma" and discussion of Gleason grades
3. Gleason Grade: The statement indicates primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4, with a total Gleason score of 7 (3+4=7), which corresponds to Grade Group 3
