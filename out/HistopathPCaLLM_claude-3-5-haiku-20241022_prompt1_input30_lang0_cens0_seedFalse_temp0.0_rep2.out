{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned in the text.
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the mention of adenocarcinoma and Gleason grading.
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of primary pattern grade 3, secondary pattern grade 4, and the statement about the diagnosis being updated to Grade Group 3.
