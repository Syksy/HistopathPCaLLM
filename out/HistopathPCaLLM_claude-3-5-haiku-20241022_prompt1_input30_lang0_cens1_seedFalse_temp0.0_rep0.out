{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- The text appears to be a consultation note about medical uncertainty, not a definitive histopathological statement about prostate cancer
- No clear sample type is specified
- No confirmation of malignancy is made
- No Gleason grade is reported
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (not available)
