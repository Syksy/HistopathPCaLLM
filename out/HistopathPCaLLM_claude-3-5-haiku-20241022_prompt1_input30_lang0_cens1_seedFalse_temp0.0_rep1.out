{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- The text appears to be a consultation note about medical uncertainty
- There are no clear statements about a prostate biopsy or definitive cancer findings
- No specific sample type is mentioned
- No confirmation of malignancy is present
- No Gleason grade can be determined from this text
- All fields are therefore marked as "NA" (not available)
