{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes", 
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" (specifically targeted biopsy)
2. Malignancy is "yes" (multiple references to tumor/cancer)
3. Gleason grade is based on the most severe lesion described:
   - Primary pattern is 4
   - Secondary pattern is 5
   - Therefore, Gleason sum is 4+5=9
   - This is confirmed by the statement that the previous Gleason 6 did not capture the most aggressive tumor characteristics
