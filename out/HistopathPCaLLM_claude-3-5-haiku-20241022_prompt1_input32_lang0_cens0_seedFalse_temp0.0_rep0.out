{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the first sentence describing the procedure.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate".
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as this is the most severe pattern mentioned in the description of the Gleason patterns. While other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3 are noted, the 4+4 pattern is the most severe and should be reported according to the instructions.
