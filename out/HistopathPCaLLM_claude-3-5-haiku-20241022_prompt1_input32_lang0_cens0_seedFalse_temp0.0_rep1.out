{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of the procedure.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because a multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate was detected.
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8", which represents the most severe Gleason pattern mentioned in the statement (the 4+4 pattern at the base of the prostate).
