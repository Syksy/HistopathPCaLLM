{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of the procedure
2. Malignancy is "yes" because a multifocal adenocarcinoma was detected
3. The Gleason grade is "4+4=8", which represents the most severe pattern observed in the prostate base (among the various Gleason patterns mentioned: 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, and 4+4)
