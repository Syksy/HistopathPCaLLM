Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a specific sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, suggesting no malignant findings, so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: With no malignancy detected, "NA" is the appropriate response.

The statement provides a general overview of sample examination but lacks specific details about a definitive prostate cancer diagnosis or Gleason grading.
