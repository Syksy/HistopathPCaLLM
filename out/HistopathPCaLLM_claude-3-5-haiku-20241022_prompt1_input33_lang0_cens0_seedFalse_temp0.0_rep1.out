{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement describes tumor growth, capsule penetration, and lymph node involvement.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on the description of growth pattern varying between Gleason types 4+3 and 3+4, with the more severe pattern (4+3) being reported.
