{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the text describes tumor growth, capsule penetration, and lymph node involvement.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on the statement "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3", where the more severe pattern (4+3) is selected as per instructions.
