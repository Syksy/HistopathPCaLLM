Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: "NA" - The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings"
3. Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason score is mentioned, and there are no malignant findings
