{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Cannot definitively determine from the text, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" and describes hyperplastic tissue, so marked as "no"
3. Gleason score: Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason score is marked as "NA"
