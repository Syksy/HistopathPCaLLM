{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found, only PIN changes and hyperplasia were noted
