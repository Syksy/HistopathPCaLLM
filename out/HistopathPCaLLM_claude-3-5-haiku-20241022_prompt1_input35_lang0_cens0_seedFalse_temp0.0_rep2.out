{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes were noted, which are not considered cancer
