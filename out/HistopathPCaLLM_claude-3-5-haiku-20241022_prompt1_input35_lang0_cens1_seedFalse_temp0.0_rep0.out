{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of samples from left and right lobes
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes high-grade PIN changes and hyperplasia, but does not indicate a malignant tumor
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
