{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified in the text.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity".
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found and the text describes only benign findings like nodular and epithelial hyperplasia.
