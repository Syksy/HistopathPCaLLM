{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes benign findings (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia)
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was found and no Gleason score is applicable
