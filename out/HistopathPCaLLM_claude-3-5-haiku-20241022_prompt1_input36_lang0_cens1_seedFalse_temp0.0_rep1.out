{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes benign findings (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia)
3. Gleason score is "NA" as there are no malignant findings
