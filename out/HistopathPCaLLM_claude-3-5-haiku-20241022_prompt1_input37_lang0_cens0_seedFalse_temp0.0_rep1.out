{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "electrosection chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (benign condition)
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason score is "NA"
