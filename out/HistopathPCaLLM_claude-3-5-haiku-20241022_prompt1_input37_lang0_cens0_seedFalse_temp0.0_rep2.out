{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the mention of "electrosection chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (benign condition)
3. Since no malignancy is found, Gleason grade is "NA"
