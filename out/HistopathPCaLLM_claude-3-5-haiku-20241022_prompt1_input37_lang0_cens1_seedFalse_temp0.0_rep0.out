{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of a partial sample examination
2. No malignant tumor findings are reported; the statement describes normal prostate tissue with minor inflammation
3. Since no malignancy is detected, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
