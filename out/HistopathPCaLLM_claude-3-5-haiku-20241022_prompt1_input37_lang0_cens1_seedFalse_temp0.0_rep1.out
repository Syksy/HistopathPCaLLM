{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of prostate tissue examination
2. Malignancy is "no" because no malignant tumor findings are mentioned
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignant tumor was detected
4. The statement describes a partial examination with minor inflammation, but no cancer was identified
