{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of a partial sample examination of prostate tissue.
2. Malignancy is "no" because no malignant tumor findings are mentioned. The statement describes normal prostate tissue with minor inflammation.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was detected.
