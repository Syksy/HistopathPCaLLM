{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

The reasoning for this structured response is as follows:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the original text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No suspected malignity"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found, and the tissue was described as hyperplastic with chronic inflammation
