{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the text "Representative needle biopsies as samples"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the text explicitly states "No suspected malignity"
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is set to "NA"
