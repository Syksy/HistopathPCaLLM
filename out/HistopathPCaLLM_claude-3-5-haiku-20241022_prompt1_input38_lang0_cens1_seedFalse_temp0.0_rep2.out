{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not specified, so marked as "NA"
2. The statement describes hyperplastic prostate tissue and chronic inflammation, which are benign findings, so "Malignancy" is marked as "no"
3. No Gleason grade is applicable for benign findings, so marked as "NA"
