{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description of a "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of tumor foci
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the text explicitly mentions Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages, with the major grade listed first
