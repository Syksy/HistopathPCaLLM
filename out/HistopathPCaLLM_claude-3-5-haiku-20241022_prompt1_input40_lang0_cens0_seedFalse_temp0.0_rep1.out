{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of shaving material and the context.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary explicitly states "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and the text mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth".
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA".
