{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not clearly specified, so "NA" is used
- There are no definitive malignant tumor findings mentioned, so "no" is used
- No Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used
- The statement suggests a benign finding with hyperplasia and inflammation, but no conclusive cancer diagnosis
