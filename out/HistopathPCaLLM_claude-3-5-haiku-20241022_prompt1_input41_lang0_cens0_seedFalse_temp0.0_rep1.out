{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

The reasoning for this structured response is as follows:
1. The statement mentions "systematic biopsies", so the sample type is "biopsy"
2. The statement explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material", so the malignancy is "no"
3. Since no cancer was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
