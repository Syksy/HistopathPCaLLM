{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

The reasoning for this structured response is as follows:
1. The sample type is clearly a "biopsy" as stated in the first sentence.
2. The last sentence explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material", which indicates no malignancy.
3. Since no cancer was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
