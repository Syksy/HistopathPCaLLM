{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions samples collected from prostate lobes
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates difficulty determining cancer changes and mentions only inflammation and atrophy
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
