{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since samples were collected from prostate lobes
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates difficulty determining cancer changes and mentions only inflammation and atrophy
3. Gleason score is "NA" as no malignancy was detected
