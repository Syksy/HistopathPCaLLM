{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of Gleason grades and description of tumor differentiation
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as explicitly stated in the summary, with grade 4 being the predominant pattern
