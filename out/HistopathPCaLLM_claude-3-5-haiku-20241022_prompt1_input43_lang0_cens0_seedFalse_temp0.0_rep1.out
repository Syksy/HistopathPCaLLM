{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings" and the processing of material in multiple cassettes.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material".
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
