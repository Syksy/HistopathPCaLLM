{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason score is "NA"
