{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly specified, so marked as "NA"
2. The statement indicates no cancerous changes were found, so "Malignancy" is set to "no"
3. No Gleason grade is applicable since no cancer was detected, so marked as "NA"
