{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because while a prostate sample is mentioned, the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and describes mostly ordinary prostate tissue.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was detected.
