{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first line of the text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary indicates "no tumor tissue can be seen" despite previous cancer findings
3. Since no malignant tumor is found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
