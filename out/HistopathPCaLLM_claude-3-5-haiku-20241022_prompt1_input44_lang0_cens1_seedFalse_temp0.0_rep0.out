{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the text mentioning "prostate samples" and "biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected in this sample, despite previous mentions of cancer in earlier biopsies
