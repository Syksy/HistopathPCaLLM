{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the description "whole prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the detected tumor focus and description of tumor tissue
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the statement mentions "classes 3+4" in the tumor focus, with tissue Gleason noted as 3
