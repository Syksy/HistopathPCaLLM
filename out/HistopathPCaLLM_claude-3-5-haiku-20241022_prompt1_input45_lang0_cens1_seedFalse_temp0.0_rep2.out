{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not explicitly specified, so it is marked as "NA"
- While the statement mentions a "suspect prostate sample", the findings are ultimately negative, with no clear malignancy detected
- The statement explicitly notes that the "structure is unclear and not able to detect"
- No Gleason grade is applicable since no malignancy was found
- The statement indicates negative findings, with clean seminal vesicles, negative margins, and no metastases
