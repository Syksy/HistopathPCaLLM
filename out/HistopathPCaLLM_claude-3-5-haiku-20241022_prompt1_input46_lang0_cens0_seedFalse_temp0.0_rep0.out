{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "Shaved prostate chippings" and the tissue processing details.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material."
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no cancer was found, and the statement describes only benign tissue findings.
