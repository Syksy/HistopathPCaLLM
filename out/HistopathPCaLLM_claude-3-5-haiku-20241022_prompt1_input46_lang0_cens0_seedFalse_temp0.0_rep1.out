{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "Shaved prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Since no cancer was found, the Gleason score is "NA"
