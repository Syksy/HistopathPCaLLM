{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Prostate material" being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates regular prostate tissue and specifically notes "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no specific Gleason grade was mentioned
