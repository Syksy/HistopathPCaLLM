{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Prostate material" being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates regular prostate tissue and mentions inability to definitively assess cancer-related changes
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
