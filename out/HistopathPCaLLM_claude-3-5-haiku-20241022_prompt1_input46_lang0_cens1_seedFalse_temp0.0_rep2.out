{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Prostate material" being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates regular prostate tissue and no definitive cancer findings
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no specific Gleason grading was mentioned
