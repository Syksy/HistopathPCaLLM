{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the text mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No malign findings on the left or the right"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
