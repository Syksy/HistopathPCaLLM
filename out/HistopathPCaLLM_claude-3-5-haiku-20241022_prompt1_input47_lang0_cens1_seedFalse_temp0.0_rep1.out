{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of examined sample material from prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says they are "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings" and describes normal prostate epithelium.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
