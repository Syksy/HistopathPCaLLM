{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of examined sample material from right and left prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says they are "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings" and describes only normal prostate epithelium with chronic inflammation.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
