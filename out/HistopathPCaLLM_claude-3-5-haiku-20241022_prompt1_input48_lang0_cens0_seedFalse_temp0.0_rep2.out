{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the clear description of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9" as per the summary statement, which indicates the most severe lesion has Gleason 5 as the primary grade and Gleason 4 as the secondary grade, totaling 9
