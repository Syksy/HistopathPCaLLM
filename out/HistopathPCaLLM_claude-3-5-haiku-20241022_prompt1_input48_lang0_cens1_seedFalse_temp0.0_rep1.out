{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because the text describes autopsy samples without specifying a specific clinical sample type
- Malignancy is "no" because the text indicates no definitive malignant tumor findings
- Gleason is "NA" as the summary explicitly states that no differentiation scores (Gleason grades) were determined
