{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not clearly specified, so "NA" is used
- No malignant tumor findings are reported, so "no" is used
- The summary explicitly states that no differentiation scores (Gleason grades) are being derived, so "NA" is used for Gleason
