{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the mention of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma was detected in 5 out of the shavings
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the most common Gleason class is 3 (primary/major grade) and the second most common is 4 (secondary/minor grade), which results in a Gleason sum of 7
