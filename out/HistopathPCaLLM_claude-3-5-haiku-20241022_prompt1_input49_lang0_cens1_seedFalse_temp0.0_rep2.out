{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "prostate samples" and investigation on "8 glasses", which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because while some changes were noted that warrant further investigation, no definitive malignant finding is confirmed.
3. Gleason score is "NA" due to the lack of a conclusive malignancy assessment and technical limitations preventing further evaluation.
