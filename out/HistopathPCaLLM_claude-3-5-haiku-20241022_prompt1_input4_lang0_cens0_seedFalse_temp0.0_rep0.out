{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates benign tissue and explicitly states no adenocarcinoma is present
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
