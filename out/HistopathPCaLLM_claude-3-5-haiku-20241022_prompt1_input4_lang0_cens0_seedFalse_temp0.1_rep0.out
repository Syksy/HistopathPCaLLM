{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignancy is "no" because the text states "benign prostate tissue" and "do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
