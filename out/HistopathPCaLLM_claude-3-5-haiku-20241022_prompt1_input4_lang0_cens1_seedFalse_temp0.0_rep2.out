{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" based on the context of sampling sites and tissue sampling.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions no notable atypic patterns and insufficient material to confirm adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and the sample was deemed insufficient for definitive assessment.
