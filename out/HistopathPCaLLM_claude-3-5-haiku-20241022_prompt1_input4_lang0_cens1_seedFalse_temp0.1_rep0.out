{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the context of multiple sampling sites and tissue sampling.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions no notable atypic patterns and insufficient material to confirm adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason score is "NA" due to the inability to definitively assess the presence of malignancy.
