{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" based on the context of sampling sites and prostate tissue sampling.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions no notable atypic patterns and insufficient material to confirm adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive malignant finding and insufficient sample material to grade.
