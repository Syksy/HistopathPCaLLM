{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple sections taken from different parts of the prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the report explicitly states "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed" and no definitive cancer diagnosis is made.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no clear Gleason grading could be inferred, and the report suggests the samples are benign.
