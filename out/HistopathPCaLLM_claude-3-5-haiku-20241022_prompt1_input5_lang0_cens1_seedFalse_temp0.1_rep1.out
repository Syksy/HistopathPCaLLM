{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples taken from different parts of the prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the report indicates "Microscopically clear prostate tissue" and no definitive cancer diagnosis.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no clear Gleason grading could be inferred, and the report suggests the samples are benign.
