{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "shaving chips" and multiple tissue cassettes.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes benign prostate hyperplasia and normal prostate glandular structures.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
