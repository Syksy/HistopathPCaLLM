Based on the provided statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The text explicitly mentions "prostate biopsies", so the sample type is "biopsy".
2. Malignancy: The statement suggests a suspicious finding of adenocarcinoma ("morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma"), so the malignancy is marked as "yes".
3. Gleason Grade: Since the finding is described as small and inconclusive, and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- "prostate biopsies" indicates biopsy sample type
- "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" indicates potential malignancy
- The finding is described as small and not conclusive, so no specific Gleason grade can be assigned
