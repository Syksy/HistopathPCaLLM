Based on the provided statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate biopsies", so the sample type is "biopsy".
2. Malignancy: Although the finding is described as "suspicion-level" and not conclusive, there is a suggestion of adenocarcinoma, so the malignancy is marked as "yes".
3. Gleason Grade: Since the finding is inconclusive and no definitive Gleason grade is specified, the grade is marked as "NA".

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- The text describes prostate biopsies
- There is a mention of "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma"
- The finding is described as small and not conclusive
- No specific Gleason grade is provided
