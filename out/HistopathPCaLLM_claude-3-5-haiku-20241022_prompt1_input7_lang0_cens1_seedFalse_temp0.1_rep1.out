Based on the provided statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement refers to a prostate sample collection.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the atypical structures were "diminishingly small".
3. Gleason is "NA" since no definitive malignancy was confirmed.

The key phrases that support this interpretation are:
- "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected"
- "some atypical structures and morphological changes"
- "finding was so diminishingly small"
- "no definite conclusions could be drawn"
