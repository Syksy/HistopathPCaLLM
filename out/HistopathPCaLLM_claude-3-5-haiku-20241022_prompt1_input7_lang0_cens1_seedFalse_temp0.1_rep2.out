Based on the provided statement, here's the structured JSON response:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement refers to a prostate sample collection
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the atypical structures were too small to confirm malignancy
3. Gleason is "NA" since no definitive malignant finding was reported
