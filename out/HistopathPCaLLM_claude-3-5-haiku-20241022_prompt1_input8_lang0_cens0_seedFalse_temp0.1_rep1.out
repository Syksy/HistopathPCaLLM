{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the text: "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because tumor tissue is observed with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly reported in the statement: "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7"
