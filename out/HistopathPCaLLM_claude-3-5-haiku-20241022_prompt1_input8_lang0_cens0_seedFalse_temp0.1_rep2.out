{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignancy is "yes" because tumor tissue is observed with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly reported in the statement, which represents the highest identified Gleason growth pattern
