{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly confirms that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor was identified, and the text mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing"

The structured response follows the specified JSON format and captures the key information from the pathological statement.
