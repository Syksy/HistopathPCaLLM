{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple tissue samples being examined
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly confirms that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no definitive malignant tumor was identified, and the text mentions missing grade scores and uncertainty about grading
