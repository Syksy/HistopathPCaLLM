{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "NA" because no specific type of prostate sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
- Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates the epithelial cell lining appears normal and no definitive cancer is reported
- Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason grading was performed
