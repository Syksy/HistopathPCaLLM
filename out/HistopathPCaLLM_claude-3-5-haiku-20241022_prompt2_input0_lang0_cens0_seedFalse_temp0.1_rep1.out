{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "Chipping samples" and multiple blocks being processed.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and describes benign prostate tissue.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and thus no Gleason grading is applicable.
