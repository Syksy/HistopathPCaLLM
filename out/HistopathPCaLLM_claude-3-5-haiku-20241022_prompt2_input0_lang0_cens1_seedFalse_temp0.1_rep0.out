Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "sample material" and "prostate tissue", which suggests a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and no malignancy was found.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy was detected, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
