Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and no malignancy was found, so "no" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no malignancy was detected, the Gleason grade is "NA".
