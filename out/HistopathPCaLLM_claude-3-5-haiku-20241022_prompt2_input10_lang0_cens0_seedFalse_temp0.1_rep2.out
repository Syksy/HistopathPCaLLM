{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the conclusion states the finding is "leaning towards benign" and there is no definitive carcinoma diagnosis
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was confirmed and no Gleason score was reported
