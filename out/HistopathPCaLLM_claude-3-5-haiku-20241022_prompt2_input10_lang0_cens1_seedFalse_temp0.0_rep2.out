{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not describe a definitive prostate cancer diagnosis
- The sample type is not specified (marked as "NA")
- The statement mentions "normal basal cells" and no malignant tumor findings (marked as "no")
- No Gleason grade is reported (marked as "NA")

The text appears to be a description of sample handling and preliminary examination with no conclusive cancer diagnosis, so the structured data reflects the lack of specific diagnostic information.
