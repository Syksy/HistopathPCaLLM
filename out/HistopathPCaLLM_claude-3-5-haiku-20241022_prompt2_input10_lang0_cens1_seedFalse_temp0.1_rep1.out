{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not describe a definitive prostate cancer diagnosis
- Sample type is not specified, so marked as "NA"
- The text mentions "normal basal cells" and no explicit malignancy, so "Malignancy" is set to "no"
- No Gleason grade is mentioned, so marked as "NA"

The statement appears to be a technical description of sample handling and staining procedures, with no clear evidence of malignant tumor findings.
