{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not describe a definitive prostate cancer diagnosis
- The sample type is not specified (marked as "NA")
- The statement indicates normal basal cells were observed, suggesting no malignancy
- No Gleason grade is mentioned, so it is marked as "NA"
- The text describes technical difficulties with sample processing and staining, but does not provide a clear cancer diagnosis
