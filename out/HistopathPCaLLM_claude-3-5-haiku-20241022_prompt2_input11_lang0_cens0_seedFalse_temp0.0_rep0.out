{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because invasive tumor tissue is explicitly mentioned
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly stated in the text "with a Gleason grading 4+3"
