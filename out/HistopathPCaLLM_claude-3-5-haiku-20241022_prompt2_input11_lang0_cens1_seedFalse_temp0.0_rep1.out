Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates no definitive malignant tumor findings. While Gleason scores of 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are not confirmed as part of a malignant tumor, and only 5% of the material could be investigated. Therefore, "no" is used.
3. Gleason: Since no definitive malignant tumor is identified, "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "could not be reliably assessed"
- "only 5% of the whole material could be investigated"
- "evaluation remains inconclusive"
- No explicit confirmation of a malignant tumor
