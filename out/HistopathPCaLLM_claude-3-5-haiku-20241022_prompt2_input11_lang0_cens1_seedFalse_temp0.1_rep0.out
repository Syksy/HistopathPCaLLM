Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates no definitive malignant tumor findings. While Gleason scores of 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are not confirmed as part of a malignant tumor, and only 5% of the material could be investigated. Therefore, "no" is used.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".

The key observations supporting this interpretation are:
- No definitive malignancy is reported
- Only 5% of the material was investigated
- The evaluation remains inconclusive
- The cell architecture resembles normal prostate tissue
