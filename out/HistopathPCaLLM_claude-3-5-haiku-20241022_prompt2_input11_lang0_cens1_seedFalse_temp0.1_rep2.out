Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates no definitive malignant tumor findings. While Gleason scores are mentioned, they are not confirmed as representing a malignant tumor. The text suggests an inconclusive evaluation with only 5% of material investigated.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "could not be reliably assessed"
- "requested evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive"
- No definitive statement of cancer or malignant tumor
