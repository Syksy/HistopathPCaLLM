Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate", which is typically associated with a Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states that the material is "classified as benign", so the malignancy is "no".
3. Gleason: Since the sample is benign, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
