Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified guidelines:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: While the statement mentions a prostate sample, there is no clear specification of the exact sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: Although "prostate cancer tissue" is mentioned, the statement lacks definitive confirmation of malignancy, so "NA" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No specific Gleason grade is provided in the statement, so "NA" is used.

The statement appears to be a preliminary or incomplete pathology report that does not provide sufficient detailed information to definitively structure the requested fields.
