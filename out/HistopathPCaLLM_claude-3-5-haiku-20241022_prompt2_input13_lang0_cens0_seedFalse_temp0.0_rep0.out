{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the text ("prostate needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma is observed
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" as explicitly stated in the text, representing the most severe lesion (Gleason score 4 in primary pattern and 5 in secondary pattern, totaling 9)
