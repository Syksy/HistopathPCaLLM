{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

The reasoning for this structured output is as follows:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma is observed in sample B
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" as explicitly stated in the text, representing the most severe lesion with a Gleason score of 9 (4 as the primary grade and 5 as the secondary grade)
