{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of samples taken from prostate locations
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates no definitive malignant findings, only mentioning "suspicious pattern" that requires further verification
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was confirmed
