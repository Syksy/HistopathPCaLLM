{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "prostatetectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the explicit mention of "tumorous growth"
3. Gleason score is "3+4=7" as the statement indicates a Gleason 7-stage carcinoma with the larger portion being score 3 (approximately 60%)
