{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is confirmed through-out the sample
3. Gleason score is "4+4=8" as the statement indicates Gleason 4 is the most represented, with a sum of 8
