{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- The statement indicates an inconclusive histopathological examination
- No definitive Gleason grade is reported
- The sample type is not specified
- While there is a mention of suspected adenocarcinoma, no confirmed malignancy is established
- The text suggests further examination is needed to confirm or discard initial suspicions
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA"
