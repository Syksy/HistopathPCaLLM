{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "three fusion biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma focuses are described
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the conclusion that describes architecture 3 covering about 2/3 and architecture 4 covering about 1/3 of the carcinoma part, with a total Gleason score of 7
