{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "three fusion biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of carcinoma focuses
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of mainly level 3 grade growth with some Gleason 4-type structures, and the explicit conclusion stating a Gleason score of 7 with architecture 3 covering about 2/3 and architecture 4 covering about 1/3 of the carcinoma part
