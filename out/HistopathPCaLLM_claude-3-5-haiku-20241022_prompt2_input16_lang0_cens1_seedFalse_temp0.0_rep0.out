{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale for this structured response:
1. The statement does not definitively specify the sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. While the text mentions "suspicious foci" and suggests potential malignancy, there is no conclusive statement of malignant tumor findings, so "NA" is used.
3. The text explicitly states that Gleason grading is inconclusive due to resolution issues, so "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.

The statement describes a technical challenge in digital histopathology assessment, highlighting difficulties in grading, but does not provide a clear, definitive diagnostic conclusion about the prostate tissue sample.
