{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the statement "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to multiple clear foci of tumor and description of tumor infiltration
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as the statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3"
