{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because multiple prostate tissue samples (A-D, E-F, G-N) are mentioned, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "NA" because while the text discusses potential Gleason grades (between 3 to 5), no definitive malignancy is confirmed.
3. Gleason is "NA" because no specific Gleason score is assigned, only a potential range is mentioned.

The text appears to be a preliminary report discussing potential assessment of prostate tissue samples, with no conclusive findings of malignancy.
