{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" which is typical of a biopsy.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the text explicitly mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma".
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the statement "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area". This suggests a Gleason pattern of 3 (primary grade) and 4 (secondary grade), totaling 7.
