Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that >95% of material appears benign, and the suspicious focus is too small to definitively classify. Therefore, "no" is used to indicate no confirmed malignancy.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, and the suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade, "NA" is used.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "normal cell architecture"
- ">95% of material appears benign"
- "suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group"
