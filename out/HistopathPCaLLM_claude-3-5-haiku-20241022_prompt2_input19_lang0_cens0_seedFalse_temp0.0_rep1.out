{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" because sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of sample 4 having Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%) components, which sum to a Gleason score of 7
