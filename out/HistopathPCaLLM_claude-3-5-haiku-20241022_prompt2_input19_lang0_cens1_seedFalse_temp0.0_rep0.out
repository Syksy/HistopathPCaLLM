Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample type: Cannot be definitively determined (marked as "NA")
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions samples 1-3 are benign, and sample 4 is uncertain but not confirmed as malignant. Therefore, the malignancy is marked as "no".
3. Gleason grade: No definitive Gleason grade is reported, so it is marked as "NA"

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Samples 2 and 3 are described as "healthy benign prostate tissue"
- Sample 4 has uncertain tissue characteristics but is not confirmed as malignant
- No specific Gleason grading is provided in the statement
