Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that samples 1-3 are benign, and sample 4 is uncertain but not confirmed as malignant. Therefore, "no" is the appropriate response.
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason grade is "NA".

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Samples 2 and 3 are described as "healthy benign prostate tissue"
- Sample 4 has uncertain tissue characteristics but is not definitively diagnosed as malignant
- No definitive malignant tumor finding is reported in the statement
