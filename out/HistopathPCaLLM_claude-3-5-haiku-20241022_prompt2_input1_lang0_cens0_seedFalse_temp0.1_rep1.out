{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the conclusion explicitly states "only benign-like growth is observed"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and thus no Gleason grading is applicable
