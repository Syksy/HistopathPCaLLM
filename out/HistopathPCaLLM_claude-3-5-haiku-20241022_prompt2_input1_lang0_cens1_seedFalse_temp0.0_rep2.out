{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the mention of "prostate cancer samples" and "standard locations"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates "mostly normal cell architectures" and the results are "inconclusive"
3. Gleason is "NA" since no definitive Gleason grade is reported and the findings are inconclusive
