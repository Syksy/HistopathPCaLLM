{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is detected in multiple sections.
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" based on the description of the basis section, which presents "mostly with class 4+4". While the apex shows 3+4, the most severe lesion is at the basis with 4+4, so this is the grade that should be reported.
