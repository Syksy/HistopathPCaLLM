{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is detected in multiple sections.
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" based on the description of the basis section presenting mostly with class 4+4, which represents the most severe lesion in this case. While the apex shows 3+4, the basis section with 4+4 is more severe and thus takes precedence.
