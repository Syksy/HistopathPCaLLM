{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not provide a clear, definitive histopathological finding
- There is no explicit confirmation of malignancy
- No specific Gleason grade is reported
- The text suggests that a proper assessment is not possible due to previous therapies affecting tissue morphology
- The sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA"
