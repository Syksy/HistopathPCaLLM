{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of tumor-like tissue and poorly differentiated growth
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9" because the most severe lesion is described as having the most common grade of 5, with a secondary grade of 4, resulting in a Gleason sum of 9
