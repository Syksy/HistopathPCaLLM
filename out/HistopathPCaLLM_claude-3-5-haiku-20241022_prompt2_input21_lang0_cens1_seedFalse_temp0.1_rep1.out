Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement describes technical difficulties in assessment and suggests the material needs further quality control, so "NA" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and the statement suggests the material is not conclusive for grading, so "NA" is used.

The statement appears to be a technical description of a problematic sample with insufficient clarity to make definitive diagnostic statements.
