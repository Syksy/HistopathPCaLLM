{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the text ("prostate thick needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma tissue structures are detected
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of "low grade differentation" with Gleason scores of 3 and 4, with the more significant grade listed first (3+4=7)

The structured data follows the specified JSON format and captures the key information from the histopathological statement.
