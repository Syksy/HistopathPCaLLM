{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma tissue structures are detected
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description of "low grade differentation" with Gleason score first of 3 and secondly of 4, which translates to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7
