{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of tissue sampling material with fragments from left and right sides.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly indicates that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no definitive Gleason score could be assigned due to sample fragmentation and variability.
