{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragmented tissue samples.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly indicates that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and need to be reprocessed.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no definitive Gleason score could be assigned due to the fragmented and variable nature of the samples.
