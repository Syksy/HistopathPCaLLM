{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as specified in the first sentence "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "4+5=9" based on the conclusion stating "Gleason-score sum 9" and the description of tumor components (60% grade 4, 30% grade 5, with a small tertiary grade 3 component)
