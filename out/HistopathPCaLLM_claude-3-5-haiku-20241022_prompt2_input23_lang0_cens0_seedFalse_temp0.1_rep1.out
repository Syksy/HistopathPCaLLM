{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as specified in the first sentence "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is derived from the most severe lesion:
   - Primary grade is 4 (60% of tumor showing stage 4 differentiation)
   - Secondary grade is 5 (30% of tumor showing stage 5 differentiation)
   - This results in a Gleason score of 4+5=9, which matches the conclusion's Gleason-score sum of 9 and grade group 5
