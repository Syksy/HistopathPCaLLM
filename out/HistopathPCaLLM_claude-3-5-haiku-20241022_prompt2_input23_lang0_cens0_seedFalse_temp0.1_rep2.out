{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as specified in the text "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "4+5=9" based on the description of differentiation stages and the explicit conclusion of "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5"
   - Primary (most common) grade is 4 (60% of tumor)
   - Secondary grade is 5 (30% of tumor)
   - Tertiary grade is 3 (small proportion)
   - Sum of primary and secondary grades is 4+5=9
