{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" as specified in the text ("turp-chippings")
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the summary mentions "malignant suspicion" and "adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as explicitly stated in the summary ("resulting in sum 8")

The structured data follows the specified JSON format and captures the key information from the histopathological statement.
