{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because multiple tissue cylinders were taken for examination
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on:
   - Sample (1) has Gleason 4 pattern (20%) and 3 pattern (30%)
   - Sample (2) has Gleason 4 pattern (15%) and 3 pattern (<35%)
   - The most severe lesion appears to be in Sample (1) with a Gleason score of 4+3=7
