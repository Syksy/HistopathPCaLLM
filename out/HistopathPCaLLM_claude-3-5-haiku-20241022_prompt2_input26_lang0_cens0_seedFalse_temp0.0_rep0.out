{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of a "widely spread tumor"
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description that the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
