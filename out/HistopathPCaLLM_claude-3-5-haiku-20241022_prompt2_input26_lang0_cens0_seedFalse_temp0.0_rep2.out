Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because a widely spread tumor is described throughout the specimen.
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the statement mentions a dominant Gleason class of 3, with class 4 differentiation being almost as prevalent, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
