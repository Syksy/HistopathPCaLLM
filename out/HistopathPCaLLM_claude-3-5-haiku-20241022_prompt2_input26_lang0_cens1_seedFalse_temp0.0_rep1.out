{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA", 
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement does not provide a clear confirmation of malignancy
- The sample type is from prostate, but cannot be definitively classified as biopsy, RP, or TURP
- While there is a mention of a possible "Gleason sum 7", the text explicitly states that this is unverified and the histopathology is difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" based on the lack of definitive diagnostic information
