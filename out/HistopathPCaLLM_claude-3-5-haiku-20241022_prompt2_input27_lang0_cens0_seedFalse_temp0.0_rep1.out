{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of "shavings" and multiple blocks being examined
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma was detected
3. Gleason score is "3+3=6" as explicitly stated in the statement
