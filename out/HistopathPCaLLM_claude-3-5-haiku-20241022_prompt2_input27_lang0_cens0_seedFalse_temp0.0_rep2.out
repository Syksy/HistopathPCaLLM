{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

The reasoning for this structured result is as follows:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the statement describes tissue shavings processed across multiple blocks, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma was explicitly detected.
3. Gleason grade is "3+3=6" as directly stated in the histopathological description.
