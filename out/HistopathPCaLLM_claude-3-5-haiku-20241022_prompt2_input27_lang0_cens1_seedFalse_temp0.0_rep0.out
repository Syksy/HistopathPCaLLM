Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and suggests this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that the growth patterns did not follow normal tumor differentiation, and there's uncertainty about even a minimal Gleason score. Therefore, I interpret this as a "no" for malignancy.
3. Gleason: Since there's no definitive malignancy, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".

The key phrases that influenced this interpretation:
- "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue"
- "growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation"
- "Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities" (which is not definitive enough to classify as malignant)
