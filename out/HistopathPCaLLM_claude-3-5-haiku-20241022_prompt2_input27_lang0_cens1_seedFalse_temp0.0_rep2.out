Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and suggests this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as multiple samples were examined from the total prostate tissue.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates no clear malignant tumor findings. While there's a mention of a potential Gleason score 3, it's described as debatable and in small quantities, so I've classified this as "no" malignancy.
3. Gleason Score: Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
