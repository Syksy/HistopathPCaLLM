{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

The reasoning for this structured result is:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the first sentence
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to multiple adenocarcinoma findings
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as this is the highest grade malignant finding (Focus #1), which matches the summary statement of "the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8"
