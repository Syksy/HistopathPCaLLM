Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" because the text describes multiple regions of interest (RoIs) being examined from prostate tissue, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are atypical and pre-malignant changes mentioned, no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed in the statement.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no specific Gleason grading is provided and no confirmed malignancy exists.

The key observations supporting this interpretation are:
- Multiple sites of interest are examined
- Atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes are noted
- The material is sent for further pathological evaluation
- No definitive cancer diagnosis is made in the statement
