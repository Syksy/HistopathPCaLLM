{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) because the description mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and details multiple sections from different lobes, which is typical of a complete prostate removal.

2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement explicitly mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" with details about tumor characteristics.

3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as directly stated in the summary: "Score sum 7" and the text describes tumor cells with mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern, with a smaller portion as grade 3, matching the 4+3=7 Gleason score.
