{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement describes "Fresh prostate tissue material" obtained through multiple samples (A-F), which indicates this is a prostate biopsy.
2. Malignancy: No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported. The statement mentions non-prostatic tissue and inability to assess tumor characteristics, suggesting no clear malignancy.
3. Gleason Grade: The summary explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible", so "NA" is appropriate.
