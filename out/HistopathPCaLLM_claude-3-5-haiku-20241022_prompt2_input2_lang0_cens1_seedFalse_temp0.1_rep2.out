{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "NA", 
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement describes an autopsy specimen for research
- No definitive malignancy is confirmed
- No specific Gleason grade is reported
- The summary suggests further investigation is needed
- The sample cannot be reliably characterized for malignancy
- Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA"
