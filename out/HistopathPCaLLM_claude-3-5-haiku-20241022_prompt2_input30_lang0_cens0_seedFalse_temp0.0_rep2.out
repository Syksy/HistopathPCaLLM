Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: "NA" - No specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is clearly mentioned in the text.
2. Malignancy: "yes" - The statement mentions a moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma and confirms malignant findings.
3. Gleason Grade: "3+4=7" - The text indicates a revised Gleason grade with primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4, and a total Gleason score of 7 (Grade Group 3).

The structured data reflects the most severe lesion and follows the specified JSON format with the requested fields.
