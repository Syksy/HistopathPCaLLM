Based on the provided statement, which appears to be a consultation note with no clear histopathological findings, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
- The text does not specify a sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP)
- There are no definitive malignancy findings
- No Gleason grade is mentioned
- The statement describes an inconclusive consultation that requires further examination
