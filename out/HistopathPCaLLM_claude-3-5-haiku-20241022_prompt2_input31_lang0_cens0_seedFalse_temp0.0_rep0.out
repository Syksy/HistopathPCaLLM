{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "two targeted biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of tumor findings
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the description of the second targeted biopsy with primary differentiation pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, which represents the most severe lesion in the statement
