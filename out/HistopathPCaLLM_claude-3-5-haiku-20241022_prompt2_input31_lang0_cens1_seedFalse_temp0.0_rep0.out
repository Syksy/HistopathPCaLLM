Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since samples were taken for examination
2. Malignancy is "no" because:
   - The samples contain only suspicious findings
   - Only 5% of samples were suspicious
   - The interpretation was inconclusive
   - Additional samples and treatment planning are needed
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive malignant diagnosis
