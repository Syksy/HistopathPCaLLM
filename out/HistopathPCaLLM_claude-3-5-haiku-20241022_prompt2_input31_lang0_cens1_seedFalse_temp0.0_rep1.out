Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since samples were taken for diagnostic purposes.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates suspicious but inconclusive findings, with only 5% of samples showing suspicious characteristics, and additional samples and interpretation are needed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive malignant diagnosis and the need for further investigation.
