Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since samples were taken for diagnostic purposes.
2. Malignancy is "no" because while there are suspicious findings, they only encompass 5% of the samples and the interpretation is inconclusive.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive malignant diagnosis and the need for additional samples and treatment planning.
