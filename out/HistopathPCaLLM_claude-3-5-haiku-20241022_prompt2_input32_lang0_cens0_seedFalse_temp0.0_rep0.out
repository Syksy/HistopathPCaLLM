{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because a multifocal adenocarcinoma is described.
3. Gleason grade is "4+4=8" as this is the most severe Gleason pattern mentioned in the statement (other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3 are also present, but 4+4 is the most severe).

The structured data captures the key information from the histopathological statement while following the specified JSON format and rules.
