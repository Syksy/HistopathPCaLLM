Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a specific sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement mentions that "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear", which suggests no malignancy was found, so "no" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No specific Gleason grade is mentioned, so "NA" is used.

The statement appears to be a general summary of examination findings without providing specific details about a prostate cancer diagnosis or Gleason grading.
