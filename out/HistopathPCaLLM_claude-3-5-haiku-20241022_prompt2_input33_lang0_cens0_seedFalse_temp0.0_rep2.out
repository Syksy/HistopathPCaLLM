{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement describes tumor growth, capsule penetration, and lymph node involvement.
3. Gleason grade is "4+3=7" based on the description of growth pattern varying between Gleason types 3+4 and 4+3, with the more severe pattern (4+3) being used as per instructions to report the most severe lesion.
