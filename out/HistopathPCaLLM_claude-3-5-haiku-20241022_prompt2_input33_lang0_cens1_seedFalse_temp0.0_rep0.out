Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Score: No Gleason score is mentioned, so "NA" is used.

The structured response follows the guidelines of providing the most severe lesion's information, using only the allowed values, and presenting a non-nested JSON format.
