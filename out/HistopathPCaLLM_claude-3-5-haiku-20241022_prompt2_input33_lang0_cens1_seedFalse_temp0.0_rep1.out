Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sampletype is "NA" because no specific sample type is mentioned.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles".
3. Gleason is "NA" as there are no specific Gleason grades mentioned and no malignant tumor is identified.

The statement appears to be a general, non-specific pathology report with no clear definitive findings of prostate cancer.
