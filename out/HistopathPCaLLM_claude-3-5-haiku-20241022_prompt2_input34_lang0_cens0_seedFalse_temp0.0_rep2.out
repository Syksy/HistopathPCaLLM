{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of a resection sample
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no malignities" and "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is "NA"
