Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Cannot be definitively determined from the text, so marked as "NA"
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic" and describes hyperplastic tissue, so marked as "no"
3. Gleason grade: No malignancy is reported, so marked as "NA"
