Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" as no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is clearly mentioned.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic" and describes hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
