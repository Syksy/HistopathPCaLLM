Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement explicitly mentions "representative prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement concludes "No signs of carcinoma"
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and there are only mentions of high-grade PIN changes and hyperplasia, which are non-cancerous conditions
