Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" because the statement mentions samples from left and right lobes, which is typical of a prostate biopsy.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes high-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) and hyperplasia, which are non-malignant findings.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found, and thus no Gleason grading is applicable.
