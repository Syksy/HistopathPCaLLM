{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of the preparate's weight and size, which suggests a complete prostate removal.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity".
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and the statement describes only benign findings like nodular and epithelial hyperplasia.
