Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The description suggests this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, given the weight and size of the preparate.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states "No signs of malignity", so the malignancy is "no".
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
