{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a preparate with weight and size typical of a surgically removed prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity".
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and the statement describes benign findings like nodular and epithelial hyperplasia.
