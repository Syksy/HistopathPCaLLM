Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes nodular and epithelial hyperplasia, which are benign conditions.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found and no Gleason grading was performed.
