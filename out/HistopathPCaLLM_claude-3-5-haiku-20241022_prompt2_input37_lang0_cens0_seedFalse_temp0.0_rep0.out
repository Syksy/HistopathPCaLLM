Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "electrosection chippings" which is typical of a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (a benign condition) and there is no mention of malignant tumor.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
