Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "electrosection chippings" which is typical of a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (benign condition) and no malignant tumor is mentioned.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since there is no malignancy detected.
