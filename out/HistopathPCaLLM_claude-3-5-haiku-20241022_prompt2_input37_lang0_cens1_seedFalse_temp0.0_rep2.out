Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement refers to a prostate tissue sample.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement does not indicate any malignant tumor findings. The description mentions only "partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation".
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason grading was provided.
