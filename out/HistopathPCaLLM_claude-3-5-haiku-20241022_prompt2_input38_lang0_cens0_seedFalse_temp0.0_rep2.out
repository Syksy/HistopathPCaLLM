Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as specified in the statement ("Representative needle biopsies as samples")
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No suspected malignity"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
