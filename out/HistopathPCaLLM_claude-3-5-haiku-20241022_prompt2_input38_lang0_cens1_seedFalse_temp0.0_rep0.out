Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because no specific sample type is mentioned
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement describes hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, which is a benign finding
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
