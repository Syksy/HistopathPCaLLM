{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because a tumor with multiple foci was detected
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as explicitly stated in the text, with 3 being the primary (major) grade and 4 being the secondary (minor) grade
