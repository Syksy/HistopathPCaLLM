Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
