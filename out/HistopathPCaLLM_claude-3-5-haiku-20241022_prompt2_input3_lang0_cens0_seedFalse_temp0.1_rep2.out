Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "prostate chippings" and describes a tissue sample typical of a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly states "Nothing indicating malignancy is found."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was detected.
