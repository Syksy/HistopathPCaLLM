Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate), which is evident from the description of shaving material and the procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary explicitly states "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth".
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
