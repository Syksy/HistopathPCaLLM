Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate), which is typical for this type of tissue sample.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary explicitly states "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth".
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and thus no Gleason grading is applicable.
