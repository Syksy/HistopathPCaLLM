Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of shaving material and examination of prostate tissue.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary explicitly states "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth".
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and therefore no Gleason grading is applicable.
