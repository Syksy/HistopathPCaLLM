Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement suggests no definitive malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "hyperplastic prostate" and inflammation, which are typically benign conditions. Therefore, "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, so "NA" is used.

The structured response follows the guidelines of providing the most severe lesion's information, and uses the allowed values for each field.
