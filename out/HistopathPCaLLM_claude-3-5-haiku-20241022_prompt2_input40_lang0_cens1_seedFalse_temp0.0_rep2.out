Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement suggests no definitive malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "hyperplastic prostate" and suggests further examination is needed, which implies a benign finding.
3. Gleason Grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, so "NA" is used.

The structured data reflects the uncertainty and lack of definitive malignant findings in the original statement.
