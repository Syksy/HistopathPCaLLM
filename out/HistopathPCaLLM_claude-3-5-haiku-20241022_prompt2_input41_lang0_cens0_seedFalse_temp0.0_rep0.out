Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as systematic biopsies from right and left lobes were taken
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
