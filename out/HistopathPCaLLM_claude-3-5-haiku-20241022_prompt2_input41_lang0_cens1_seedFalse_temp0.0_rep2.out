Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" since samples were collected from prostate lobes, which is typical of a prostate biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates no definitive cancer findings, only mentioning chronic inflammation and atrophied glands.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason score was reported.
