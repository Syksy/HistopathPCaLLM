{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of Gleason grading and description of tumor differentiation
3. Gleason score is "4+3=7" as explicitly stated in the summary, with Gleason grade 4 being the primary (major) grade and Gleason grade 3 being the secondary (minor) grade
