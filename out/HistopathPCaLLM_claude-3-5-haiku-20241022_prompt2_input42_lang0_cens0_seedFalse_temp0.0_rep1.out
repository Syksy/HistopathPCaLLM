{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the phrase "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of Gleason grades and tumor differentiation
3. Gleason score is "4+3=7" as explicitly stated in the summary, with 4 being the primary (major) grade and 3 being the secondary (minor) grade
