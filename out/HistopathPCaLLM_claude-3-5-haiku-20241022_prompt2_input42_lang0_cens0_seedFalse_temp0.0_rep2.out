{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "Prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the presence of Gleason grade differentiation
3. Gleason score is "4+3=7" as explicitly stated in the summary, with the primary (major) grade being 4 and the secondary (minor) grade being 3
