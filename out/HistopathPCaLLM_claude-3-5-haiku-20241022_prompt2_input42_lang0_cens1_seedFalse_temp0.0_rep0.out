Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify the type of prostate sample, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states that it cannot be determined whether the findings are cancer or inflammation, so "NA" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: Since malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The statement lacks clear diagnostic information about the presence of cancer or specific Gleason grading, which leads to the "NA" values across all fields.
