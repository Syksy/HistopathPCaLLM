Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify the type of prostate sample, so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states that it cannot be determined whether the findings are cancer or inflammation, so "NA" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive cancer diagnosis is made, the Gleason grade is "NA".

The statement indicates uncertainty about the nature of the findings, which prevents a more specific classification.
