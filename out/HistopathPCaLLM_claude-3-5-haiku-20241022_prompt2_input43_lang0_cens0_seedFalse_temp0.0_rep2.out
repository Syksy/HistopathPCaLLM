Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was found
