Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since it mentions prostate samples
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and describes mostly ordinary prostate tissue
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was detected
