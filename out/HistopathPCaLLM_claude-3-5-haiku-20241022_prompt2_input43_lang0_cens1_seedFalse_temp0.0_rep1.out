Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) since the statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and describes "mostly ordinary prostate tissue"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found
