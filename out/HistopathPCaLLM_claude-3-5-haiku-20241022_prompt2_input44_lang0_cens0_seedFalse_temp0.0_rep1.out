Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the text.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary indicates "no tumor tissue can be seen" in the current biopsy, despite earlier biopsies showing cancer.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no current malignant tumor was found in this biopsy.
