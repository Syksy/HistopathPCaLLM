Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as explicitly stated in the first line.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the summary indicates "no tumor tissue can be seen" in the current biopsy, despite earlier biopsies showing cancer.
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignant tumor is present in this current sample.
