Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" because the statement mentions "prostate samples" and references "earlier biopsies".
2. Malignancy is "no" because the current statement explicitly states "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" and describes normal tissue.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy is detected in this current sample, despite a previous history of prostate cancer.
