{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "whole prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the description of tumor tissue focus
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" as the statement describes gland structures with classes 3+4, which translates to a Gleason score of 7
