Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "No metastases seen" and the structure is "not able to detect", suggesting no clear malignant tumor findings, so "no" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and no malignancy is confirmed, so "NA" is used.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "structure is unclear and not able to detect"
- "No metastases seen in lymph nodes"
- "Negative marginals, capsel intact"

These suggest a negative finding without definitive malignancy.
