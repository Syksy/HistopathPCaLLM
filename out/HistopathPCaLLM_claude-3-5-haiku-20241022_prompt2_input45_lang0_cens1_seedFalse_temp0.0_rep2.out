Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "No metastases seen" and the structure is "unclear and not able to detect", suggesting no definitive malignant tumor findings, so "no" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and no malignancy is confirmed, so "NA" is used.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "not able to detect"
- "No metastases seen"
- "Further inspection is needed"

These suggest an inconclusive finding without a clear malignant diagnosis.
