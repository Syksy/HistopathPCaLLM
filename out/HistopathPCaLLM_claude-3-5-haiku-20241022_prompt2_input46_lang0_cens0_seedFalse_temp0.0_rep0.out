Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is characteristic of a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material."
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found.
