Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement refers to "Prostate material" and appears to be a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates regular prostate tissue with no definitive cancer findings, and mentions "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not".
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was confirmed and no Gleason score was reported.
