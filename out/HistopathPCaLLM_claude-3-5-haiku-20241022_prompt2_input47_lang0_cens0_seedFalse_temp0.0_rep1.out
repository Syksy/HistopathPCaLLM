{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The statement describes a prostate biopsy (6 total biopsies from right and left)
- There are explicitly "No malign findings"
- Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason score is marked as "NA"
- The sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of examining multiple biopsy cores
