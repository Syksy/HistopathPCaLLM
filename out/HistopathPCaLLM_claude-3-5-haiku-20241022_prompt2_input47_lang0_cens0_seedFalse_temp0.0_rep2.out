Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions examining three biopsies from the right and three from the left.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly states "No malign findings on the left or the right."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and therefore no Gleason grading is applicable.
