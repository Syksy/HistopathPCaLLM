Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement describes examined sample material from the prostate.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions normal prostate epithelium and indicates no malign findings.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason score was reported.
