{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the clear description of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "5+4=9" as the summary states the most severe tumor focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small portion of Gleason 4, resulting in a Gleason sum of 9
