{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g"
2. Malignancy is "yes" due to the clear statement of adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "5+4=9" as the summary indicates the most severe lesion has a Gleason score of 9, with the primary (first) grade being 5 and the secondary grade being 4
