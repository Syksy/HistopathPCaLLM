{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified as a standard clinical sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. The statement indicates no clear malignant tumor findings, with the summary suggesting no definitive cancer diagnosis.
3. The summary explicitly states that no Gleason scoring is being derived, so "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- Multiple autopsy samples were examined
- No explicit cancer diagnosis is made
- The text emphasizes this is for educational purposes
- No specific Gleason grading is applied
