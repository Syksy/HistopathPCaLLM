{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified as a standard clinical sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. The statement indicates no clear malignant tumor findings, with the summary suggesting no definitive cancer diagnosis.
3. The summary explicitly states that no Gleason scoring is being derived, so "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.

The text appears to be a description of an autopsy sample used for educational purposes, with no clear diagnostic intent for prostate cancer.
