{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified as a standard clinical sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. The statement indicates no clear malignant tumor findings. The summary suggests this is an educational/demonstration sample with no definitive cancer diagnosis.
3. The summary explicitly states that no differentiation scores (Gleason grades) are being derived, so "NA" is used for Gleason.
