Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "prostate chippings" which is typical of a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement explicitly mentions that 5 shavings contained carcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the statement indicates the most common Gleason class is 3 (primary grade) and the second most common is 4 (secondary grade), which results in a Gleason score of 7.
