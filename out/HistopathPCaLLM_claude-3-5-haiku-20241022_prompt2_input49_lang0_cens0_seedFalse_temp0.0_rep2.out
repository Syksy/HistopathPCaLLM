Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) because the statement mentions "prostate chippings" and multiple shavings.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement explicitly states "5 shavings contained carcinoma".
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because the statement indicates the most common Gleason class is 3 and the second most common is 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
