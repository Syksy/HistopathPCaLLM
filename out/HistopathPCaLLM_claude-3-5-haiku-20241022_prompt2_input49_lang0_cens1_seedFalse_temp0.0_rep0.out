Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "prostate samples" and investigation across multiple glasses (typical of a biopsy procedure).
2. Malignancy is "no" because while some changes were noted that warrant further investigation, no definitive malignant tumor is confirmed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the technical limitations preventing a full assessment and no clear malignant finding.
