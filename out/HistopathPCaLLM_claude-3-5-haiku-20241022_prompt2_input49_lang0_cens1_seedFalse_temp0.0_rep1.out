Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "prostate samples" and investigation across multiple glasses (cores).
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates only some changes that warrant further investigation, but no definitive malignant tumor finding is reported.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a clear malignant diagnosis and the mention of technical limitations preventing further assessment.
