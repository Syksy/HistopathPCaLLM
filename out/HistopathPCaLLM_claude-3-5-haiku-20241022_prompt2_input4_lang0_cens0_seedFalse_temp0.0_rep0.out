Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly specified as "biopsy"
2. The statement explicitly states that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, so "Malignancy" is set to "no"
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is set to "NA"
