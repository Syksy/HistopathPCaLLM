Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly specified as "biopsy"
2. The statement explicitly states that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma
3. Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason score is marked as "NA"
