Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" because the statement describes multiple sampling sites and tissue samples, which is typical of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly states that no notable atypic patterns are present and the sample is insufficient to confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was detected and no Gleason grading could be assigned.
