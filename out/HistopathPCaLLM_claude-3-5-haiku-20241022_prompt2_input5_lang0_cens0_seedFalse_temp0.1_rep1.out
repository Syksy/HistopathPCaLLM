{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as explicitly stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because cancerous tissue is observed in the apex macroblocks.
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the description in macro B, which shows the most severe lesion with a Gleason sum of 9 (architecture 4+5).
