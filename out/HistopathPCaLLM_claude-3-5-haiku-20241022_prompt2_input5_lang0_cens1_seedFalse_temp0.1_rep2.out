{
    "Sampletype": "biopsy",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" because the text describes a prostate tissue sample with multiple sections processed from different areas (apex and basis).
2. Malignancy is "no" because the text explicitly states "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed" and no definitive malignant tumor findings are reported.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" since no clear Gleason grading could be inferred, and the statement suggests the sample is benign.
