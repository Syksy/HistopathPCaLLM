{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "shaving chips" and the context of the specimen.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia" and notes normal prostate glandular structures.
3. Since no malignancy is found, the Gleason grade is "NA".
