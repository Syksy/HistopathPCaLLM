Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate), which is evident from the description of "shaving chips" and the context of the examination.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia" and notes "relatively normal prostate glandular structures".
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found, and thus no Gleason grading is applicable.
