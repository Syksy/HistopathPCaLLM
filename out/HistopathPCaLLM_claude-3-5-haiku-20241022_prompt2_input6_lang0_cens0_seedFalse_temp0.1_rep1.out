Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "shaving chips" and the context of the examination.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia" and describes the glands as "relatively normal".
3. Gleason score is "NA" since no malignancy was found and the specimen is benign.
