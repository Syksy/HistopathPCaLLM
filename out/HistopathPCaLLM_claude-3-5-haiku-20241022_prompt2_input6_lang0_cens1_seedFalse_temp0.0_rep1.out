Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is selected because the statement mentions "prostatic operation material"
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the results are described as inconclusive and no definitive malignancy is reported
3. Gleason is "NA" due to the inability to properly examine the sample and the inconclusive nature of the results

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "very fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material"
- "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected"
- "results are therefore inconclusive"
- "re-examination is heavily suggested"
