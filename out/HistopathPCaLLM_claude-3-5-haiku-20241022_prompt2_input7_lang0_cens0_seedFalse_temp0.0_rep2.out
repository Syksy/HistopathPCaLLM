Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate biopsies", so the sample type is "biopsy".
2. Malignancy: Although there is a suspicion of adenocarcinoma in one sample, the pathologist notes that the finding is too small to draw a conclusive finding. Therefore, the malignancy is reported as "no".
3. Gleason Grade: Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".

The key phrases that influenced this interpretation are:
- "suspicion-level"
- "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet"
- "Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures"
