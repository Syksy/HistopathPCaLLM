Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "prostate sample", which suggests a biopsy was performed.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly indicates that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the atypical structures were "diminishingly small". Therefore, malignancy is marked as "no".
3. Gleason Score: Since no definitive malignancy was found, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
