Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "prostate sample", and since no specific type is explicitly stated, but a biopsy seems implied by the nature of the sampling, I've selected "biopsy".
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and describes the finding as "diminishingly small", with no clear confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy is marked as "no".
3. Gleason Score: Since no malignancy was confirmed, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".

The JSON follows the specified format with the three required fields, using the allowed values as instructed.
