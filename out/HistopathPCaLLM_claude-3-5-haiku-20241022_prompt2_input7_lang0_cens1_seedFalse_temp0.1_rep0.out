Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "prostate sample", and since no specific type is mentioned other than a general sample collection, I've defaulted to "biopsy" as the most likely sample type.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly indicates that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the finding was "diminishingly small". The language suggests no clear malignancy, so I've marked this as "no".
3. Gleason Score: Since no malignancy was confirmed, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".

The structured JSON follows the specified guidelines, providing clear, non-nested data that captures the key information from the histopathological statement.
