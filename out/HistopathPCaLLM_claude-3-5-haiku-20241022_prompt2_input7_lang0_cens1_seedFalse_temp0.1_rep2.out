Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype is "biopsy" as the statement refers to a prostate sample collection
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement indicates that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the atypical structures were "diminishingly small"
3. Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was confirmed
