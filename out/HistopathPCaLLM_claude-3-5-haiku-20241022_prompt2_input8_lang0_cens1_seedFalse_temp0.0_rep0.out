Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a standard sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: While there are references to Gleason patterns, no definitive grade is reported. The text mentions "empty fields" and "no grade score is reported", so "NA" is used.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- No clear sample type specified
- Explicit confirmation of no malignant findings
- Lack of a clear, reportable Gleason grade
- Mention of potential PIN changes, but no confirmed malignancy
