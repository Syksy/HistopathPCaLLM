Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a standard sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: The statement indicates that Gleason patterns are missing or not clearly reported, with "empty fields" for major and minor grades. Therefore, "NA" is used.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- No definitive malignancy is confirmed
- Gleason grading is incomplete or unclear
- No specific sample type is definitively stated
