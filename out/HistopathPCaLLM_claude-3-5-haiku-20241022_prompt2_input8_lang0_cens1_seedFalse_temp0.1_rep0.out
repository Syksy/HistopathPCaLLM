Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a standard sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: The statement suggests incomplete or missing Gleason grading information, with "empty fields" for major and minor grades. Therefore, "NA" is used.

The key points supporting this interpretation are:
- No clear sample type is specified
- Samples were confirmed free of malignant findings
- Gleason grading information is incomplete or missing
- There are discussions of PIN changes but no definitive malignancy
