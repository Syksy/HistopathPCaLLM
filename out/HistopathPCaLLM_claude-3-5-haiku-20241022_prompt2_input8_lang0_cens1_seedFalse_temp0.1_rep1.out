Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Rationale:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not clearly specify a standard sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings", so "no" is selected.
3. Gleason Grade: While there are hints of potential Gleason pattern discussion, no definitive Gleason grade is reported, so "NA" is used. The text mentions "empty fields" and "no grade score is reported", further supporting the "NA" classification.

The key decision points were the explicit statement of no malignancy and the lack of a clear, reportable Gleason grade.
