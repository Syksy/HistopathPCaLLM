{
    "Sampletype": "TURP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) based on the description of "electrosection shavings" and the processing method.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No malignant findings are observed" and describes benign hyperplasia.
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA".
