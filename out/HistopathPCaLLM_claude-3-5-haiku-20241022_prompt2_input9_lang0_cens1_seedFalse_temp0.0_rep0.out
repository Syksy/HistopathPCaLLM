Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data according to the specified guidelines:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample Type: The statement does not specify a clear sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that the epithelial cell lining appears normal and no malignant tumor is mentioned, so "no" is used.
3. Gleason Grade: No specific Gleason grade is mentioned, and the findings are not malignant, so "NA" is used.

The key phrases supporting this interpretation include:
- "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal"
- "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn"
- No mention of cancer or malignancy
