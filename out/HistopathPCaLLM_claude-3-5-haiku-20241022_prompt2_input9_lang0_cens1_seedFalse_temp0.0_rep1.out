{
    "Sampletype": "NA",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not specified, so it defaults to "NA"
- The statement indicates that the epithelial cell lining appears normal and no malignancy is detected, so "Malignancy" is set to "no"
- Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is set to "NA"

The key observations supporting this interpretation are:
1. "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal"
2. No mention of cancer or malignant tumor
3. Inconclusive results due to potential technical processing issues
