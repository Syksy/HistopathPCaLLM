Based on the provided text, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The text does not clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. It only mentions "prostate samples" without further clarification, so we use "NA".

2. Malignant tumor findings: The statement does not explicitly mention any malignant tumor findings. It only talks about normal basal cells and suspicious formations related to staining issues, but not about cancer. Therefore, we use "NA".

3. Gleason grade: There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any grading system for cancer in this statement. As there's no clear indication of malignancy, we use "NA".
