Based on the provided text, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The text does not clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. It only mentions "prostate samples" without further details, so we use "NA".

2. Malignant tumor findings: The text does not mention any malignant tumor findings. It only discusses normal basal cells and staining patterns. There's no clear indication of malignancy, so we use "NA".

3. Gleason grade: There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any grading system in the text, so we use "NA".

The text primarily focuses on the logistics of sample handling and the results of immunological stainings, without providing specific information about malignancy or grading.
