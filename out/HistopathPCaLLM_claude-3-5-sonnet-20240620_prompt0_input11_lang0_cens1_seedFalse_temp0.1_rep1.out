Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it's set to "NA".
2. The text does not clearly state whether malignant tumor findings were present or not, so it's set to "NA".
3. Although Gleason scores 3 and 4 are mentioned, the text states that they "could not be reliably assessed," so the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
