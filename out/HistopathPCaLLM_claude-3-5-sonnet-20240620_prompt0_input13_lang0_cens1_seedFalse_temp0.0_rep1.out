Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate."
2. The statement does not clearly indicate whether there are malignant tumor findings. It mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but does not confirm malignancy, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, so it's marked as "NA."
