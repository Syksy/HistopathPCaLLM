Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate, totalling in a bit more total sample material originating from the right side in comparison with the left. In sample B some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague. This suspicious pattern includes enough material for inspection and assessment from the left side, but at this time further verification is needed via consultation. Rest of the samples seem to exhibit rather ordinary patterns, and there are no out of the ordinary inflammation either.
