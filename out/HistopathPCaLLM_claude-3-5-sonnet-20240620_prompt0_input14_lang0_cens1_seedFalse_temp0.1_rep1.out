Based on the provided text, I will structure the data according to the requested fields. Here's the JSON output:

{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The text mentions "comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and multiple samples, which suggests this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignant findings: The text does not explicitly state whether malignant tumors were found. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" but does not confirm malignancy, so this is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. Gleason grade: No specific Gleason grade is reported in the text. There is a mention of a comparison to a "Gleason 7 score patient," but this is not a direct finding for this specimen. Therefore, this is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
