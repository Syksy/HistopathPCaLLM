Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as multiple samples (A-O) are mentioned, which is typical for prostate biopsies.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in this statement. The text mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades, but no actual findings are reported.
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported. The text only mentions that Gleason grades between 3 to 5 might be assessed in the future.

Given the lack of definitive information about malignancy and Gleason grade, "NA" (Not Available) is used for these fields.
