Here's the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure."
2. There are malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 7, with the larger fraction being stage 3 (60% of the tumor area). Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "3+4=7".
