Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies", so it's a biopsy.
2. Malignant findings are present, as adenocarcinoma is reported in sample 4.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The most severe lesion is reported, so the Gleason grade is structured as 3+4=7.
