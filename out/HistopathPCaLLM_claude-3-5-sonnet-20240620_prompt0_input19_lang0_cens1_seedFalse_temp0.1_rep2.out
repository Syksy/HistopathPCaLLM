Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "samples" and "cylinder," which suggests these are biopsy samples.
2. Malignant tumor findings: The statement is inconclusive about malignancy. Sample 4 is suspicious but uncertain, and further verification is needed. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings.
3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, and since malignancy is not confirmed, the appropriate value is "NA".
