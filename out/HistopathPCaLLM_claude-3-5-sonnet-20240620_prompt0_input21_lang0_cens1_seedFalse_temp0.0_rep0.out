Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" (Not Available) because the statement does not clearly indicate the presence or absence of malignancy. The assessment is confounded by technical issues and poor quality of the sample.
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Available) because no specific grading is mentioned, and the statement indicates that cell differentiation patterns could not be properly assessed due to technical issues.
