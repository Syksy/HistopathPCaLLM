Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments.
2. Malignant tumor findings are "NA" (Not Available) because the statement does not provide clear information about malignancy due to technical issues and poor quality of the sample.
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Available) because the statement does not mention any Gleason grading, and the quality issues prevent proper assessment of cell differentiation patterns.
