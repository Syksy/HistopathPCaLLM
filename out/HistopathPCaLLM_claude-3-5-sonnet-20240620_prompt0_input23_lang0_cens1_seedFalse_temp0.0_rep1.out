Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. There are no clear malignant tumor findings reported in this statement, so it's set to "NA".
3. While there is a mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior report, this is not a definitive diagnosis for the current sample. Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
