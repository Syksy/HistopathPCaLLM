Here's the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as it describes multiple tissue cylinders.
2. Malignant tumor findings are present ("yes"), as the statement concludes with "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7". This is derived from the most severe lesion, which is in Sample (1) where Gleason 4 pattern is 20% and Gleason 3 pattern is 30%. The higher grade (4) is reported as the major pattern, and the lower grade (3) as the minor pattern.
