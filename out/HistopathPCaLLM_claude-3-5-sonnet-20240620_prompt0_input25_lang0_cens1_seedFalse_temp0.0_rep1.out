Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples and their fragmented nature.
2. Malignant tumor findings are marked as "NA" because the statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified.
3. The Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because no definitive malignant findings were reported, and the statement mentions that differentiation could not be assessed in some samples.
