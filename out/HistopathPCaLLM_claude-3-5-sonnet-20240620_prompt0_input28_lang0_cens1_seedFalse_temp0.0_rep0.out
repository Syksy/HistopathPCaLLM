Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "six different sites of interest" and multiple regions of interest (RoIs) being examined.
2. There are no clear malignant tumor findings reported. The statement mentions "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes," but no definitive malignancy is described.
3. Since no malignant findings are reported, the Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Applicable).
