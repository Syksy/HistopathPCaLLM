Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the description of multiple regions of interest being examined.
2. While there are atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes mentioned, there is no definitive statement of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. Since no malignant tumor is definitively reported, and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
