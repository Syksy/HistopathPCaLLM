{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "targeted biopsy" as the most recent and relevant procedure.
2. There were malignant tumor findings, so this is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 4+5=9, which represents the most severe lesion described in the statement. The primary pattern is 4, and the second most common pattern is strongly suspected to be 5, resulting in a Gleason sum of 9.
