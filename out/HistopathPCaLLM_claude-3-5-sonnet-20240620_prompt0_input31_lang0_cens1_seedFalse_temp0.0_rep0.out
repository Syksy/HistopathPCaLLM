Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "samples were taken," which implies a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignant tumor findings: The text mentions "suspicious findings," which suggests potential malignancy, so we can consider this as a "yes."
3. Gleason grade: There is no specific mention of a Gleason grade in the provided statement, so this is marked as "NA."

Note that while there are suspicious findings, the statement doesn't provide enough detail to determine a specific Gleason grade. The text also mentions difficulties in interpretation and the need for additional samples, which further supports the lack of a definitive Gleason grade.
