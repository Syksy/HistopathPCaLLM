Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "original primary prostate tissue" and "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles," which suggests this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: The statement implies there were findings in the prostate tissue, and specifically mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. This suggests there were likely malignant findings in the prostate, so we can infer "yes" for this field.
3. Gleason Grade: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grading. Therefore, we use "NA" for this field.
