Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "original primary prostate tissue" and "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles," which strongly suggests this is from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While not explicitly stated, the presence of multiple samples with different examination results and the mention of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being "clear" implies that there were malignant findings in the prostate itself.
3. Gleason Grade: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grading, so this is marked as "NA".
