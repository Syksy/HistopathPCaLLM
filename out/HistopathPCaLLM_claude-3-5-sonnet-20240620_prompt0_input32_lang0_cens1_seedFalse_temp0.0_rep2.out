Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample Type: The statement mentions "original primary prostate tissue" and "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles," which suggests this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. Malignant Tumor Findings: While not explicitly stated, the mention of examining lymph nodes and seminal vesicles implies that this is a cancer case, so we can infer "yes" for malignant tumor findings.

3. Gleason Grade: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grading, so this field is marked as "NA".

Note that this structured data is based on limited information from the given statement and some inferences. The Gleason grade, in particular, is not mentioned, so it's marked as "NA" despite the likely presence of cancer.
