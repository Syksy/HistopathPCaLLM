Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Radical prostatectomy preparate started normally according to protocol. On the edges of the capsule, growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3. Tumor has penetrated the capsule (estimate T3b). View specific information from the additional details of the report. One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes in processed macro sections. No malignant findings in seminal vehicles.
