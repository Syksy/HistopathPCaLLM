Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of the preparate weight and size, which is typical for TURP specimens.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Applicable) because the statement describes a benign condition (nodular hyperplasia) with no malignancy.
