Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's set to "NA".

The statement describes partial examination of prostate tissue with some benign findings, but does not provide conclusive information about malignancy or grading. Further examination is pending, so the available information is insufficient to determine definitive answers for the requested fields.
