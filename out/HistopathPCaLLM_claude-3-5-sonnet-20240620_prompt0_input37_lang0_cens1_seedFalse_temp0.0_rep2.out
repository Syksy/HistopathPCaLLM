Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's set to "NA".

The statement primarily describes incomplete examination of prostate tissue with some benign findings, but does not provide enough information to determine the sample type or presence of malignancy definitively.
