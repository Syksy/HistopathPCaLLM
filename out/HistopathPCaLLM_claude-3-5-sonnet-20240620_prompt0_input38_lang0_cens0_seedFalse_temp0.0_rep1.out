Here's the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",

}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "No suspected malignity."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because there were no malignant findings, and Gleason grading is only applicable to malignant prostate cancer.
