Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "prostate chippings."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement describes a benign condition without any mention of malignancy or Gleason grading.
