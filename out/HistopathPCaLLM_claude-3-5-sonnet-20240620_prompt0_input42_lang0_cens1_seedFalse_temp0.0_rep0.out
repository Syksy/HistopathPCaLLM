Here's the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "mixed findings" but cannot determine if it's cancer or inflammation, so malignant tumor findings are set to "NA".
3. Since there's no clear indication of cancer or Gleason grade, it's set to "NA".
