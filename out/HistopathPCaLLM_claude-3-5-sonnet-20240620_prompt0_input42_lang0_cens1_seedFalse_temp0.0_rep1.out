Here's the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "mixed findings" but explicitly states that it cannot be determined whether it's cancer or inflammation. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is set to "NA".
3. Since no cancer is definitively diagnosed, and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
