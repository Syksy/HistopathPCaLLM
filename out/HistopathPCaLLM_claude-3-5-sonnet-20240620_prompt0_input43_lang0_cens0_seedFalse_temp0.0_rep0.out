Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "prostate chippings."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignancy was found, and Gleason grading is only applicable to malignant prostate cancer.
