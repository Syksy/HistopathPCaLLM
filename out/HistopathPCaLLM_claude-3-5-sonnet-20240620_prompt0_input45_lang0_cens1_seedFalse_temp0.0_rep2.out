Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement does not definitively confirm or deny malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".

The statement describes a suspect prostate sample with some abnormal findings, but it doesn't provide clear information about malignancy or a Gleason grade. The conclusion suggests that further inspection is needed due to unclear structure.
