Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it mentions "Prostate material" and describes processing of the tissue.
2. The statement does not definitively confirm or rule out malignant findings, stating "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." Therefore, the malignant tumor findings are marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. Since no cancer is confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
