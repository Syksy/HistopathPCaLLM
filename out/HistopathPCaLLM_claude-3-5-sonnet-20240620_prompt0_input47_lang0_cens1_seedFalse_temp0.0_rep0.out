{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the description of examining material from the right and left sides of the prostate.
2. The presence of malignant tumor findings is marked as "NA" (Not Available) because the statement explicitly says they were not able to determine whether there are malign findings.
3. The Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading in the statement.
