Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies" in the text.
2. The statement indicates that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, so there are no malignant tumor findings.
3. Since the samples are benign, there is no Gleason grade reported, so it is marked as "NA".
