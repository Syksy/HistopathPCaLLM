Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the given statement:

{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy" based on the mention of "Several sampling sites" and "sample material".
2. Malignant tumor findings are marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma.
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" as there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading in the statement.
