Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "Chipping samples" which is typically associated with TURP procedures.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly mentions "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Applicable) because the statement describes a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) with no mention of cancer or Gleason grading.
