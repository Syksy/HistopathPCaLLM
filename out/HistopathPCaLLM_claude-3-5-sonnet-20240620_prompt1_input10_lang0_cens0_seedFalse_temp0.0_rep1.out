Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "biopsies" in the text.
2. Although there is a suspicious focus, the statement concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain and leaning towards benign. There is no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma, so malignancy is considered "no".
3. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, and consequently no Gleason grade reported, the Gleason field is set to "NA".
