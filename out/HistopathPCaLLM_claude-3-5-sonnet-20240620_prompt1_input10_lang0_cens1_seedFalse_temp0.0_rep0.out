Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the requested format. However, it's important to note that the given text does not provide clear information for all the requested fields. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostate samples," which suggests these are likely biopsies. However, it's not explicitly stated, so this is an assumption.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not provide any clear information about malignant tumor findings. It only mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations," but these are not definitive for malignancy.
3. Gleason: There is no mention of Gleason grading in the provided text.

Given the lack of specific information about malignancy and Gleason grading, I've used "NA" (Not Available) for these fields as per the instructions.
