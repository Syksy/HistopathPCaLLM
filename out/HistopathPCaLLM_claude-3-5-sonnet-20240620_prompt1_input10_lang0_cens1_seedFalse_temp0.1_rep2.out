Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate samples," which suggests these are biopsies.
2. Malignancy: There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement focuses on the logistics of sample handling and staining issues, without mentioning any cancer diagnosis.
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade is mentioned, as there is no clear cancer diagnosis provided.

Please note that this statement is primarily about sample handling and staining issues, rather than a typical histopathological report. The structured data reflects the lack of specific cancer-related information in the given text.
