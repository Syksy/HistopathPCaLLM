Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, it's important to note that some information is not explicitly stated or is inconclusive in the given text. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. Therefore, it's set to "NA".
2. Malignancy: The text doesn't explicitly state whether malignant tumor findings are present. It mentions tubular structures of varying differentiation stages, but doesn't confirm malignancy. Therefore, it's set to "NA".
3. Gleason: Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the statement indicates that they "could not be reliably assessed". Given this uncertainty and the lack of a clear Gleason sum, it's set to "NA".
