Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy, as it mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate."
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because the statement does not explicitly confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but does not definitively state malignancy.
3. Gleason grade is set to "NA" because no specific Gleason score or grade is mentioned in the statement.
