Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatetectomy preparate" in the statement.
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumorous growth is observed and described as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 7, with the larger portion being score 3 (approximately 60%). This implies that the remaining 40% is score 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "3+4=7", following the "major+minor=sum" format.
