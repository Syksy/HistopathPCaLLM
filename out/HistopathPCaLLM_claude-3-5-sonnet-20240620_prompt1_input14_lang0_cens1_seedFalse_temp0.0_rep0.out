Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the comprehensive overview of prostate tissue and multiple samples mentioned.
2. The statement does not explicitly confirm or deny malignant tumor findings, so this is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. While a Gleason 7 score is mentioned in reference to a different patient, no specific Gleason grade is reported for this patient. Therefore, this is also marked as "NA".
