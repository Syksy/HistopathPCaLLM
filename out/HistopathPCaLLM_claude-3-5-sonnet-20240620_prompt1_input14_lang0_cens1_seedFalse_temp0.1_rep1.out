Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the comprehensive overview of prostate tissue and multiple samples mentioned.
2. The statement does not explicitly confirm or deny malignant tumor findings, so malignancy is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported in this statement. The mention of a "Gleason 7 score patient" is in reference to a different case, not this specific sample. Therefore, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
