Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy based on the mention of "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight."
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because no definitive malignant findings are reported. The statement mentions suspicions and potential findings, but nothing conclusive.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time."
