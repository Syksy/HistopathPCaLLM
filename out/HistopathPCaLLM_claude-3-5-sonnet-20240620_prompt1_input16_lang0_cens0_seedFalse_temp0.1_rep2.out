Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "fusion biopsies" from the prostate, so it's a biopsy.
2. Malignancy is present, as carcinoma is mentioned multiple times.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as score 7, with grade 3 being the predominant pattern (covering 2/3 of the carcinoma) and grade 4 being the secondary pattern (covering 1/3 of the carcinoma). Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "3+4=7".
