Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate," which suggests this is a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The presence of "suspicious foci" and discussion of cell differentiation patterns indicates malignant findings, so this is marked as "yes".
3. Gleason: Although the statement discusses Gleason grading, no specific grade is assigned due to resolution issues in the digital images. The statement suggests that grading should be done manually on the slides. Therefore, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA" (Not Available) in this structured format.
