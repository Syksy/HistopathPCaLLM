Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions multiple prostate tissue samples (A-O) from different parts of the prostate.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in this statement. The text is primarily describing the sample preparation and mentions that assessment will be done later, so the malignancy status is not available (NA).
3. While Gleason grades 3 to 5 are mentioned, there is no specific Gleason score reported for any malignant findings. The statement indicates that the assessment will be done later, so the Gleason score is not available (NA).
