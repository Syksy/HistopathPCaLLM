Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions multiple prostate tissue samples (A-O) from different parts of the prostate.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in this statement. The text is primarily describing the sample preparation and mentioning that assessment will be done later.
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported. The statement only mentions that Gleason grades between 3 to 5 might be assessed in the future.

Given the preliminary nature of this report and the lack of specific findings, "NA" (Not Available) is used for both the Malignancy and Gleason fields.
