Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. While there is a small suspicious area, the statement doesn't confirm malignancy. The majority (>95%) is described as benign, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported. The statement mentions a possible ISUP GG 1 or above, but it's not confirmed or properly assigned. For benign findings, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
