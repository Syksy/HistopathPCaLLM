Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. While there is a small suspicious area, the statement doesn't confirm malignancy. Over 95% of the material appears benign, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported, and since the overall assessment is benign, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
