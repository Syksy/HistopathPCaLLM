Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value.
2. Malignancy is present, as adenocarcinoma is found in sample 4, so "yes" is the correct value.
3. The Gleason grade is derived from the most severe lesion, which is in sample 4. The statement mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Following the convention of reporting the most prevalent grade first, followed by the highest grade, the Gleason score is reported as "3+4=7".
