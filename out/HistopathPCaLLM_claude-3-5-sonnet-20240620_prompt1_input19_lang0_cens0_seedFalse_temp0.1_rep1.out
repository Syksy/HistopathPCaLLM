Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies", so it's a biopsy.
2. Malignancy is present, as adenocarcinoma is found in sample 4.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Following the convention of reporting the most prevalent grade first, followed by the highest grade, this results in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
