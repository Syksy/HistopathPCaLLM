Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is a prostatectomy resection, which is abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. Malignancy is present, as adenocarcinoma is detected in both the apex and basis.
3. The Gleason grade reported is 4+4=8, which is the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement (basis presents mostly with class 4+4). Although a Gleason 3+4 is also mentioned for the apex, we report only the most severe finding as per the instructions.
