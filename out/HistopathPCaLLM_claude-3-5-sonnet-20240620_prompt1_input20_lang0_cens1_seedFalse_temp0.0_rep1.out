Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the statement mentions "prostate tissue samples" that are "divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region."
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly says that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region."
3. Gleason score is also marked as "NA" because no definitive Gleason score is provided. The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," but this is not an actual finding.
