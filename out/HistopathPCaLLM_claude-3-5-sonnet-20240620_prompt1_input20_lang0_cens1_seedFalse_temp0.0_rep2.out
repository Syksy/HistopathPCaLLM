Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear, direct answers to all the questions. I'll use the best available information and use "NA" where appropriate.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples," which suggests a biopsy was performed.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies given in the region. Therefore, the presence of malignancy cannot be determined, so "NA" is used.
3. Gleason: No definitive Gleason score is provided. The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," but this is not an actual finding. Therefore, "NA" is used.
