Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear, direct answers to all the questions. I'll use the best available information and use "NA" where appropriate.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples," which suggests a biopsy was performed.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present. It mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies, so we cannot determine if malignancy was found.
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason grade is reported. The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," but this is not an actual finding.
