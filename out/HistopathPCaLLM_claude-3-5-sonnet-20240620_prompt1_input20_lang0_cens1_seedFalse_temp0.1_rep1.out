Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear, direct answers to all the questions. I will use "NA" where the information is not explicitly stated or cannot be inferred with certainty.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples," which suggests a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. I've used "biopsy" as the most likely option.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy. It mentions that examination for adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies affecting the tissue. Therefore, I've used "NA".
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason score is reported. The statement hypothetically mentions "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but this is not an actual finding. Therefore, I've used "NA".
