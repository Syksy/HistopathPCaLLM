Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as indicated by the description of "extracted prostate material" in "several fragments."
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The description focuses on technical issues and quality concerns, so the malignancy status is not assessable (NA).
3. Due to the quality issues mentioned and lack of clear malignancy findings, no Gleason grade is reported, so it is marked as NA.
