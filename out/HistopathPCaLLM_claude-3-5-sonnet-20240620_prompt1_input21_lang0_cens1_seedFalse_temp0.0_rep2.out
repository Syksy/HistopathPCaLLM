Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as indicated by the "extracted prostate material" in fragments.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The quality of the sample is poor, and a definitive assessment cannot be made.
3. No Gleason grade is reported due to the poor quality of the sample and the inability to assess cell differentiation patterns.
