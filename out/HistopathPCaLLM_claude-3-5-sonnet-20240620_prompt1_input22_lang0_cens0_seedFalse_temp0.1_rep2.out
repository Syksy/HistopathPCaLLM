Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate thick needle biopsies," so it's a biopsy.
2. Malignancy is present, as carcinoma is mentioned in the left side fragments.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." This indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7, with 3 being the primary (most prevalent) pattern and 4 being the secondary pattern.
