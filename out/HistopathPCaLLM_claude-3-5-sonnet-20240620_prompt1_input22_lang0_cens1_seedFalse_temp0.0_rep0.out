Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy based on the description of prostate tissue sampling material with specific fragment lengths.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed."
3. Gleason grade is also marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and no specific Gleason score is provided.
