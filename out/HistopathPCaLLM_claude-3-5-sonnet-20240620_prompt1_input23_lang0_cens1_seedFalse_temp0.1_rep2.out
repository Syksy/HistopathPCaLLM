Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the given text, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no definitive statement about malignant tumor findings in the current sample, so it's set to "NA".
3. While there is a mention of a prior report suggesting potential Gleason 3 findings in the apex, this is not a confirmed diagnosis for the current sample. Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".

The statement primarily discusses the need for reprocessing the sample with a focus on the apex, rather than providing a definitive diagnosis or Gleason score for the current sample.
