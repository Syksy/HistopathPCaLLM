Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), as indicated by "turp-chippings" in the statement.
2. Malignancy is present, as the statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "adenocarcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "sum 8" in the summary. Since the statement only mentions Gleason 4 class tumor growth, we can infer that the Gleason score is 4+4=8.
