Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is mentioned as "biopsies" among other types, so "biopsy" is chosen as the most relevant.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because some cases were upgraded from benign to malignant (Gleason scores).
3. The Gleason grade reported is "3+3=6", which is the lowest grade mentioned for the upgraded cases. This is chosen as it represents the most common upgrade scenario described in the text.
