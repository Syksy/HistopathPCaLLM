Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions "biopsies" among the types of samples available.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement indicates that some cases were upgraded from benign to malignant (Gleason scores).
3. The Gleason grade reported is "3+3=6". This is the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement, as it notes "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". We choose 3+3=6 as it's explicitly mentioned, while 3+4 is only given as a maximum possibility.
