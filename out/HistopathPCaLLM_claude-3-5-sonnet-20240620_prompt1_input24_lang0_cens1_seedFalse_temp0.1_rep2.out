Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is mentioned as "biopsies" among other types, so "biopsy" is chosen as the most relevant.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement mentions upgrading from benign to Gleason scores, indicating malignant findings.
3. The Gleason grade reported is "3+3=6", which is explicitly mentioned as one of the upgrade outcomes. This is chosen over "3+4" because it's the lower grade mentioned, and the instructions specify to return the most severe lesion result.
