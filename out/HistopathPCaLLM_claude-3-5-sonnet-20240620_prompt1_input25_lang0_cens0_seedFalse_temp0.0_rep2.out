Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly a biopsy, as multiple tissue cylinders are described.
2. Malignancy is present, as the statement concludes with "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma."
3. For the Gleason grade, we report the most severe lesion. In this case, Sample (1) has the highest percentage of Gleason 4 pattern (20%) compared to Sample (2) (15%). The Gleason 3 pattern in Sample (1) is also higher (30%). Therefore, we report the Gleason grade as 4+3=7, representing the most severe finding.
