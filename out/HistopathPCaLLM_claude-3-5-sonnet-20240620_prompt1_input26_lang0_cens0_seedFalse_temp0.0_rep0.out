Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is a prostatectomy preparate, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. Malignant tumor findings are present, as the statement mentions a "widely spread tumor."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." Since we need to report the most severe lesion, this is interpreted as Gleason 3+4=7.
