Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of material from apex and basis of the prostate.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not clearly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The difficulty in assessment due to recent radiation therapy makes it impossible to determine definitively.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because although a "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, it is unclear if this was verified or which specific grade group it belongs to. The statement also indicates that histopathology cannot be reasonably used for assessment due to recent radiation therapy.
