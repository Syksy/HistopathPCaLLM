Based on the given statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "source prostate tissue" in multiple batches, which suggests this is a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The statement implies the presence of abnormal growth patterns and mentions a possible Gleason score, indicating malignancy.
3. Gleason: Although a Gleason score of 3 is mentioned, it's described as debatable and in small quantities. Given the instruction to report only the most severe lesion and the uncertainty expressed, it's best to mark this as "NA" rather than provide an incomplete or uncertain score.
