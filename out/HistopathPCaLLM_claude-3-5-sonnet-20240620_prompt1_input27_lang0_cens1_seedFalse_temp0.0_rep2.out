Based on the given statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "source prostate tissue" in multiple batches, which suggests this is a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The statement implies the presence of abnormal growth patterns and mentions a possible Gleason score, indicating malignancy.
3. Gleason: Although Gleason score 3 is mentioned, it's described as debatable and in small quantities. The statement doesn't provide a clear Gleason grade in the format of "major+minor=sum". Therefore, we use "NA" as the most appropriate response for this field.
