Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "six different sites of interest" and "regions of interest," which is typical for prostate biopsies.
2. There are no clear malignant tumor findings mentioned. The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperlastic changes," but does not explicitly state the presence of malignant tumors.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
