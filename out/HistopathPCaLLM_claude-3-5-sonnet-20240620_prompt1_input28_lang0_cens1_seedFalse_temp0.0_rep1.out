Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy, as the statement mentions "six different sites of interest" being examined, which is typical for prostate biopsies.
2. While there are atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes mentioned, there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement describes the changes as "atypical," "odd," and "possible pre-malignant," but does not confirm malignancy.
3. Since no malignancy is confirmed, and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason field is set to "NA".
