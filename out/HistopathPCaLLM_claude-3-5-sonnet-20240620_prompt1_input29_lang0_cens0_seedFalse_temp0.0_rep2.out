Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a fresh sample specimen of the entire prostate with a weight of approximately 40g and multiple sections taken from different areas.
2. Malignancy is present, as invasive adenocarcinoma is observed.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as a sum of 7, with the predominant grade being 4 and a smaller portion being 3 (as mentioned "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" - assuming this is a typo and should be grade 3). Therefore, the Gleason score is structured as "4+3=7".
