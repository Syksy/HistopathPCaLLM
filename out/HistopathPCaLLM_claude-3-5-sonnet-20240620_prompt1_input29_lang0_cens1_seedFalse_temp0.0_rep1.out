Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and describes multiple samples taken from different areas of the prostate. This suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or not. It mentions potential poor differentiation and possible fusing glandular structures, but these are to be re-examined. Therefore, the malignancy status is unclear and marked as "NA".
3. Gleason: The statement explicitly says "Score sum determination was not possible," so the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
