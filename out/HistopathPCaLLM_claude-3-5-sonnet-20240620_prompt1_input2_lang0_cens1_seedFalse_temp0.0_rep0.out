Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It's described as an "autopsy specimen intended for research use," which doesn't fit into the allowed categories. Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. The statement does not definitively confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" cannot be reliably inferred due to inflammatory and age-related changes. Given this uncertainty, "NA" is the most appropriate value.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. For non-malignant or inconclusive cases, "NA" is the appropriate value.
