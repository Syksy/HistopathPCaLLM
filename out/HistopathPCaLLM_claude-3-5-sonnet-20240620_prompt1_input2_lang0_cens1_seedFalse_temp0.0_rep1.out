Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It's described as an "autopsy specimen intended for research use," which doesn't fit into the allowed categories. Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. The statement does not definitively confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and suggests that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma. Given this uncertainty, "NA" is the most appropriate value.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. For cases without a clear malignancy diagnosis, "NA" is the appropriate value for the Gleason field.
