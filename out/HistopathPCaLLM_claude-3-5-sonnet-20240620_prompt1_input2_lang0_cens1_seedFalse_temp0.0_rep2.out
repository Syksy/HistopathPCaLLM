Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. It's described as an "autopsy specimen intended for research use," which doesn't fit into the allowed categories. Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. The statement does not definitively confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" cannot be reliably inferred due to inflammatory and age-related changes. Thus, "NA" is used for malignancy.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. For cases without a clear malignancy diagnosis, "NA" is used for the Gleason grade.
