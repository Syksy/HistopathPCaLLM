Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "chippings" and "urothelial cells," which are typically associated with TURP procedures.
2. Malignancy is confirmed as "yes" due to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7" based on the most severe lesion mentioned: "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3." Although a tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned, it is not included in the primary Gleason score.
