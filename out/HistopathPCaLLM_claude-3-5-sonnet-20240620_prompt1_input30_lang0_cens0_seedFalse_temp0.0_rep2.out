Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "chippings" and "urothelial cells," which are typically associated with TURP procedures.
2. Malignancy is confirmed as "yes" due to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7", which corresponds to the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement (Grade Group 3). The primary pattern is grade 4, and the secondary pattern is grade 3.
