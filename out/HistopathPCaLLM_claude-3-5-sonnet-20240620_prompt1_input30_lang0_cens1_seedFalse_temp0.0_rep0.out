Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The malignancy status is uncertain and cannot be determined from the given information, so it's set to "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement, so it's set to "NA".

The statement describes a consultation about uncertain findings, but does not provide specific information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" due to lack of relevant information.
