Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions both routine systematic biopsy and targeted biopsies.
2. Malignancy is "yes" as there are clear findings of prostate cancer.
3. The Gleason grade reported is based on the most severe lesion found, which is from the second targeted biopsy. The primary pattern is 4, and the second most common pattern is strongly suspected to be 5, resulting in a Gleason score of 4+5=9.
