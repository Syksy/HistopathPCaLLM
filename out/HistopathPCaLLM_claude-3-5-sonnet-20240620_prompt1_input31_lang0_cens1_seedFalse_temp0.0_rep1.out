Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the given text does not provide clear, specific information for all the requested fields. In such cases, I will use "NA" (Not Available) as instructed. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "samples were taken," which suggests a biopsy procedure. However, it's not explicitly stated.
2. Malignancy: The statement mentions "suspicious findings" but does not definitively confirm malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no."
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the provided text.
