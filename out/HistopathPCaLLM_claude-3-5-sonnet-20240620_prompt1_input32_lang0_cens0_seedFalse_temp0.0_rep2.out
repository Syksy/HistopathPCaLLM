Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as mentioned in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement describes a multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
3. The Gleason grade reported is "4+4=8". Although multiple Gleason patterns were mentioned (3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), the instruction specifies to return only the most severe lesion, which in this case is the Gleason 4+4 pattern.
