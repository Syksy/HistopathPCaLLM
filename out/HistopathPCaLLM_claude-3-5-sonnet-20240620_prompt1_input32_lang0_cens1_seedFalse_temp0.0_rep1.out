Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the mention of "original primary prostate tissue" and examination of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are typically assessed in RP specimens.
2. The statement does not explicitly mention malignant tumor findings, so this is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so this is also marked as "NA".

Please note that this structured data is based on limited information provided in the statement. The statement mainly describes general characteristics of the samples and does not provide specific details about malignancy or Gleason grading.
