Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical prostatectomy).
2. Malignancy is "yes" as there are clear mentions of tumor and Gleason grades.
3. The Gleason grade reported is "4+3=7". This is derived from the statement "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3". Since we are instructed to return the most severe lesion, we choose 4+3=7 as it represents a higher grade than 3+4=7.
