Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or not. It mentions "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but also states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." Due to this ambiguity, the malignancy status is set to "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
