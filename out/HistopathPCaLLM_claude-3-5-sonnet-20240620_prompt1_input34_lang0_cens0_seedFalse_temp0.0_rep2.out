Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is described as a "resection," which in the context of prostate samples typically refers to a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities," indicating that no malignant tumor was found.
3. Since no malignancy was detected, there is no Gleason grade reported, so it is marked as "NA".
