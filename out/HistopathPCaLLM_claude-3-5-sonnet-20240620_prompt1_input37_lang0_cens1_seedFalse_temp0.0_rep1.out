Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's set to "NA".

The statement describes a partial examination of prostate tissue with some benign findings (nodular gland components and minor inflammation), but it does not provide conclusive information about malignancy or Gleason grade. Further examination is pending, so the available information is insufficient to determine these values definitively.
