Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "shaving material."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement indicates "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia."
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
