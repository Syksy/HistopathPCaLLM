Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy, as multiple samples were collected from different lobes of the prostate.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement indicates uncertainty about cancer-related changes.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy was definitively reported, and no Gleason score was mentioned.
