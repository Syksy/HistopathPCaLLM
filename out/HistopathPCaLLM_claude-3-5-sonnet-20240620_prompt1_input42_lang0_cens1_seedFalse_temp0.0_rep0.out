Based on the given statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified, so it's marked as "NA".
2. The malignancy status is uncertain ("whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined"), so it's marked as "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned, so it's marked as "NA".
