Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies" in the text.
2. Although the statement mentions earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, the current biopsy shows no tumor tissue. Therefore, the malignancy status for this specific sample is "no".
3. Since no malignancy is found in the current sample, there is no Gleason grade to report, so it is marked as "NA".
