Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",

}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample".
2. Malignancy is "yes" as there is a tumor focus described.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7". The statement mentions "classes 3+4", which refers to the Gleason grades. Although a tissue Gleason 3 is mentioned later, we report the most severe lesion as instructed, which is 3+4.
