Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear information for all the required fields. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. Malignancy: The statement mentions a "suspect prostate sample" and an unclear structure, but doesn't definitively state whether malignant tumor findings are present. Therefore, "NA" is used.
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so "NA" is used.

The statement provides some details about the sample, but it lacks the specific information required for the structured fields. It suggests that further inspection is needed, which aligns with the ambiguity in the available information.
