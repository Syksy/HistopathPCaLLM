Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it mentions "Prostate material" and describes processing of the tissue.
2. The malignancy status is unclear, as the statement says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." Therefore, it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. Since no malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason field is marked as "NA".
