Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it mentions "Prostate material" and describes processing of the tissue.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" (Not Available) because the statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because no cancer was definitively identified, and thus no Gleason score was assigned.
