Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as it mentions "prostate resection."
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma was found.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 9 tumor" in the summary. Although specific Gleason patterns are mentioned for different foci, we report the highest (most severe) Gleason score, which is 9. The most common pattern in the more severe focus is 5, so we structure it as "5+4=9".
