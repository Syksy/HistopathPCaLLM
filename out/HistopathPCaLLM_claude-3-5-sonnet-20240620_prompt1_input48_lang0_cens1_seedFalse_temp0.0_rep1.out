Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the mention of "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" and the description of different parts of the prostate (apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles).
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not explicitly mention whether malignant tumors were found or not. It only mentions "some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting findings," which are not specific enough to determine malignancy.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)."
