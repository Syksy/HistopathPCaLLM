Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy, as it mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses," which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or not. It only mentions "changes that warrant further investigation" without specifying if they are malignant.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because no specific Gleason score or grade is mentioned in the statement.
