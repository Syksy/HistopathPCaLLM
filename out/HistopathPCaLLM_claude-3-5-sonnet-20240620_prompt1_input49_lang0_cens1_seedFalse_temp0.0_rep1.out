Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy" based on the mention of "prostate samples on 8 glasses," which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because the statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or not. It only mentions "changes that warrant further investigation" without specifying if they are malignant.
3. Gleason grade is set to "NA" because no information about Gleason grading is provided in the statement.
