Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "Several sampling sites" and "sample material."
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for the presence of adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because no malignancy was definitively reported, and there's insufficient material to make a determination.
