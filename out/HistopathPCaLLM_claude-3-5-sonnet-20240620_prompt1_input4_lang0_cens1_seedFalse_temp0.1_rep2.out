Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "Several sampling sites" and "sample material."
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because the statement indicates that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for the presence of adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason grade is set to "NA" because no malignancy is definitively reported, and there is insufficient material to make a determination.
