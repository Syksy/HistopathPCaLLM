Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear information for all the requested fields. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The description of multiple sections from different parts of the prostate (apex, basis) suggests this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings are present or absent. Therefore, it's set to "NA".
3. Gleason: The statement mentions that major and minor Gleason classes could not be inferred, and there's no clear Gleason score provided. Therefore, it's set to "NA".
