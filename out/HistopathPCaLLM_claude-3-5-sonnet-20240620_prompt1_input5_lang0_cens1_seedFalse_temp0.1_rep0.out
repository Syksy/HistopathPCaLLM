Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear, explicit information for all the requested fields. I will use "NA" where the information is not clearly stated or cannot be inferred with certainty.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is inferred based on the description of a full prostate specimen with multiple sections from different areas (apex, basis) being processed.
2. Malignancy: "NA" because the statement does not explicitly mention whether malignant tumor findings were present or not.
3. Gleason: "NA" because the statement mentions that major and minor Gleason classes could not be inferred, and no specific Gleason score is provided.
