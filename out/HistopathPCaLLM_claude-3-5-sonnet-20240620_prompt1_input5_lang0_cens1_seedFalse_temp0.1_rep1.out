Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear information for all the requested fields. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" which suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings are present or not. Therefore, it's set to "NA".
3. Gleason: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." Therefore, it's set to "NA".
