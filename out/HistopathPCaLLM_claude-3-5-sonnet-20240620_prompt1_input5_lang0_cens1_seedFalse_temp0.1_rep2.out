Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide clear information for all the requested fields. Here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is inferred from the description of a full prostate specimen with apex and basis samples, which is typical for RP.
2. Malignancy: "NA" because the statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or absent.
3. Gleason: "NA" because the statement mentions that major and minor Gleason classes could not be inferred, and no specific Gleason score is provided.
