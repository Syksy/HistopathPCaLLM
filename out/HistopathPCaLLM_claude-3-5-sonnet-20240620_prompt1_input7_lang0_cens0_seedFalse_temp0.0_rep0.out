Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies".
2. While there is a suspicious focus, the statement indicates that "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet". Therefore, no definitive malignancy is reported.
3. As no malignancy is conclusively reported, there is no Gleason grade provided, so it is marked as "NA".
