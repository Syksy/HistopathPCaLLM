Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies".
2. While there is a suspicious focus, the statement explicitly mentions that "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet". Therefore, we cannot confirm malignancy.
3. Since no malignancy is confirmed, there is no Gleason grade reported, so it's marked as "NA".
