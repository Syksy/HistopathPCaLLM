Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the requested format. Here's the JSON output:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The statement mentions multiple samples and discusses prostate tissue, which suggests this is likely a biopsy.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present in the main sample (sample 3). While it mentions potentially interesting properties and PIN-changes, it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. The other samples (1 and 2) were confirmed to be free of malignant findings, but they are not the primary samples of interest.
3. Gleason: "NA" - The statement mentions that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor grades. No specific Gleason score is reported.

Given the ambiguity and lack of clear malignant findings or Gleason scores, I've used "NA" for both the Malignancy and Gleason fields to reflect the uncertainty in the provided information.
