Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's set to "NA".

The statement primarily describes the processing of the sample and some general observations about the prostate tissue, but it does not provide specific information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The conclusion suggests that the sample processing may have been faulty, and no definitive conclusions could be drawn from the examined material.
