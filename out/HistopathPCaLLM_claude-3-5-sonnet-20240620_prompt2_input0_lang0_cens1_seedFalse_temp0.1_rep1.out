Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a "biopsy" as it mentions "sample material was obtained."
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted."
3. Gleason score is "NA" because there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading, and the statement is essentially describing a benign finding.
