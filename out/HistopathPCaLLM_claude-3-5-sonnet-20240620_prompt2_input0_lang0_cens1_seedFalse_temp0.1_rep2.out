Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "sample material" and "prostate tissue" being observed.
2. Malignancy is set to "no" because the statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted."
3. Gleason grade is set to "NA" because there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading, and the statement is essentially describing a benign finding.
