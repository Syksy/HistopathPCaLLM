Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "biopsies" from the prostate.
2. While there is a suspicious focus, the statement concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain and leaning towards benign. There is no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma, so malignancy is considered "no".
3. As there is no confirmed malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported, so it is marked as "NA".
