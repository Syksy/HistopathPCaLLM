Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate samples" which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: There is no mention of malignant tumor findings. The statement only describes normal basal cells and issues with staining procedures.
3. Gleason: As there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading, this is marked as "NA".
