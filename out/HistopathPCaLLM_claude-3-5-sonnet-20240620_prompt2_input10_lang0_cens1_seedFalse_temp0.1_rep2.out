Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate samples" which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: There is no mention of malignant findings. The statement only refers to normal basal cells and suspicious formations related to staining issues, not cancer.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is reported, the Gleason score is not applicable.
