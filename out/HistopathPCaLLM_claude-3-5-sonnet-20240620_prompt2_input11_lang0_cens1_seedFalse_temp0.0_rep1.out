Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and inspection of "basis, apex and mid section," which suggests this is likely a biopsy sample.
2. Malignancy: The presence of "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mention of Gleason scores suggests malignancy, even though it couldn't be reliably assessed.
3. Gleason: Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, they "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, we cannot provide a specific Gleason grade in the required format, so it's marked as "NA".
