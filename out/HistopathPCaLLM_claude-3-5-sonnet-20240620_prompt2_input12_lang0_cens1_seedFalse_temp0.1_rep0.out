Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's set to "NA".
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue".
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
