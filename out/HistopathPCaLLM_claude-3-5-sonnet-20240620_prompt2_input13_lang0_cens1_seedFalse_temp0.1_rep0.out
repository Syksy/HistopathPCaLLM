Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate."
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but does not confirm malignancy, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, so it's marked as "NA".
