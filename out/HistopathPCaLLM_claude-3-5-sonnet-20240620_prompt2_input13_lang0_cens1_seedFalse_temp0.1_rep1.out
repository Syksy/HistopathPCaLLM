Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a "biopsy" as it mentions samples taken from typical locations in the prostate.
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because while there are "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" mentioned, there is no definitive statement about malignancy.
3. Gleason score is set to "NA" as there is no mention of any Gleason grading or specific cancer diagnosis in the statement.
