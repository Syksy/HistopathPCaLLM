Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatetectomy preparate".
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumorous growth is observed.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". This indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7, where the primary (most prevalent) pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4.
