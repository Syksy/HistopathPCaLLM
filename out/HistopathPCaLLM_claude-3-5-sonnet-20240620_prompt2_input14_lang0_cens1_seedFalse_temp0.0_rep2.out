Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the mention of "comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and discussion of prostate capsule and surgical margins.
2. The statement does not explicitly confirm or deny malignant tumor findings, so malignancy is marked as "NA".
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported in the statement. There is a mention of a comparison to a "Gleason 7 score patient," but this is not a direct report of this patient's Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason field is marked as "NA".
