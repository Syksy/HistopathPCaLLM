Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and discusses multiple samples, which suggests this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not explicitly confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" but does not definitively state whether these are malignant. Therefore, the malignancy status is set to "NA".
3. Gleason: While the statement mentions a comparison to a "Gleason 7 score patient", it does not provide a specific Gleason grade for this particular case. The text suggests further investigation is needed before making a definitive statement. Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
