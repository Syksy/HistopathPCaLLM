Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by "Prostate chippings" in the statement.
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as the statement confirms "adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+4=8". The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8", which implies a 4+4 pattern.
