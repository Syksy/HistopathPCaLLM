Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as it mentions "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material."
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because while there is a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, it is not confirmed in this histopathological examination.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time."
