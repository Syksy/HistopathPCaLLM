Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "fusion biopsies" from the prostate, so it's a biopsy.
2. Malignancy is present, as carcinoma is mentioned multiple times.
3. The Gleason grade is not explicitly stated in the "major+minor=sum" format, but we can deduce it from the information provided:
   - The conclusion states a score of 7.
   - Grade 3 is the predominant pattern (covering 2/3 of the carcinoma).
   - Grade 4 is the secondary pattern (covering 1/3 of the carcinoma).
   Therefore, the Gleason grade can be interpreted as 3+4=7.
