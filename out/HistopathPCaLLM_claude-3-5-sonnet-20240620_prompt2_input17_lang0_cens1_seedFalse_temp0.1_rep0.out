Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as multiple samples (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O) from different parts of the prostate are mentioned.
2. The statement does not explicitly confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades, but no actual findings are reported.
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported. The statement only mentions that Gleason grades between 3 to 5 might be assessed in the future, but no actual grading is provided.
