Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure".
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as the statement mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason sum 7", with the larger fraction being stage 3 (60% of the tumor area). This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7, where 4 is the major grade and 3 is the minor grade.
