Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. Therefore, we use "NA" for the sample type.
2. Malignancy: While there is a small suspicious focus (less than 5%), the statement indicates that >95% of the material appears benign. Since the majority is benign and no definitive malignancy is reported, we use "no" for malignancy.
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement. For benign findings, we use "NA" as instructed.
