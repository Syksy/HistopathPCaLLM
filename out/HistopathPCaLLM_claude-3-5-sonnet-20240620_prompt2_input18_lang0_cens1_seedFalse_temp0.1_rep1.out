Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. It only mentions "standard prostate related procedures," which is not specific enough to determine the sample type. Therefore, "NA" is assigned.

2. Malignancy: While there is a small suspicious focus (less than 5%), the statement indicates that >95% of the material appears benign. The suspicious area is too small to properly assign a grade group, and no definitive malignancy is reported. Therefore, "no" is assigned for malignancy.

3. Gleason: No specific Gleason score is mentioned in the statement. The suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade group, and the majority of the sample appears benign. Therefore, "NA" is assigned for Gleason score.
