Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value.
2. Malignancy is present, as adenocarcinoma is reported in sample 4, so "yes" is the correct value.
3. The Gleason grade is derived from the description of sample 4, which contains both Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%) components. As we report the most severe lesion, and the primary grade is the most common pattern, the Gleason score is structured as "3+4=7".
