Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as it mentions "samples" and "cylinders," which are typical terms used for prostate biopsies.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy. Sample 4 shows potential abnormalities, but it's uncertain if it's truly abnormal prostate tissue or possibly mixed with non-prostate tissue.
3. Gleason score is "NA" because no malignancy is confirmed, and no Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement.
