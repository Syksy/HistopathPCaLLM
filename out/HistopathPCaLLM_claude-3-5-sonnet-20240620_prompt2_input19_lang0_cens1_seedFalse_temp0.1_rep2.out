Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as it mentions "samples" and "cylinders," which are typical of prostate biopsies.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy. Sample 4 shows abnormal tissue, but it's uncertain whether it's truly malignant or possibly mixed with non-prostate tissue.
3. Gleason score is "NA" because no Gleason grading is mentioned, and there's no confirmed malignancy.
