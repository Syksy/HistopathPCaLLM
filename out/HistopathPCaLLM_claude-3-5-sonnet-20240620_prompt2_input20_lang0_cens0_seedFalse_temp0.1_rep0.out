2. Malignant tumor findings are present, as adenocarcinoma is mentioned in both the apex and basis.
3. The Gleason grade reported is 4+4=8, which is the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement (basis presents mostly with class 4+4). Although a Gleason 3+4 is also mentioned for the apex, we report only the most severe lesion as per the instructions.
