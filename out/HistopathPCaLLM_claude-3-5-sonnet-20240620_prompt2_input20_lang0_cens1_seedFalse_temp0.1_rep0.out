Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples," which implies a biopsy was performed.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not definitively confirm or deny the presence of malignancy. It states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." Therefore, the malignancy status is inconclusive and marked as "NA".
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason score is provided. The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," but this is not an actual finding. Therefore, the Gleason score is marked as "NA".
