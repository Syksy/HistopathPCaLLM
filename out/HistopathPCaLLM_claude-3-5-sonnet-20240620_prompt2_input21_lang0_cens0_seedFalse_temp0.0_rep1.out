Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "Prostate chippings".
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as evidenced by the description of tumor-like tissue and Gleason grading.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "5+4=9", where 5 is the most common grade and 4 is the second most common grade, as stated in the text.
