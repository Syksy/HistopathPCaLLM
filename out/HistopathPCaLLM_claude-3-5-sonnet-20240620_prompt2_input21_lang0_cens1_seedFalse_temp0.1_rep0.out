Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as indicated by "extracted prostate material" in fragments.
2. There is no clear indication of malignancy in the statement. The focus is on the quality of the sample and technical issues.
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned or can be determined from the given information.
