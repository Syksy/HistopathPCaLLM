Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as indicated by "extracted prostate material" in fragments.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement focuses on technical issues and quality control concerns.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.
