Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly a biopsy, as it mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies."
2. Malignancy is present, as it describes "carcinoma tissue structures" on the left side.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7" because the statement mentions "mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." This indicates that the primary (most prevalent) Gleason pattern is 3, and the secondary pattern is 4, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
