Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly a "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies".
2. Malignancy is "yes" because carcinoma is detected in the left side fragments.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7". This is derived from the statement "Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." The most severe lesion is reported, so we use 3+4=7 as the Gleason grade.
