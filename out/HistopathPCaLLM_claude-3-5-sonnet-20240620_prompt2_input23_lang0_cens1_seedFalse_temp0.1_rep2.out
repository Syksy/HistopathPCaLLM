Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no definitive confirmation of malignant tumor findings in this statement. The text mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior report, but this is not a conclusive diagnosis for the current sample. Therefore, malignancy is set to "NA".
3. While a potential Gleason 3 is mentioned from a prior report, it's not a confirmed finding for the current sample. The statement concludes that further processing is needed to validate initial suspicions. Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
