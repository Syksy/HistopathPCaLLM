Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), as indicated by "turp-chippings" in the statement.
2. Malignant tumor findings are present, as the statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as sum 8. Although the statement doesn't explicitly mention the major and minor grades, we can infer that it's 4+4=8 based on the mention of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and the final sum of 8.
