Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings) from various patients. Since we can't determine a single specific sample type, "NA" is the appropriate value.

2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that some previously benign cases were upgraded to malignant (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4), so "yes" is appropriate for malignancy.

3. Gleason: The statement mentions upgrades to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". Following the instruction to report the most severe lesion, we should use "3+3=6". Although 3+4 is mentioned, it's not explicitly stated as a definite finding, so we use the confirmed 3+3 score.
