Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples and tissue fragments.
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because the statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified.
3. Gleason grade is set to "NA" because no specific Gleason score is mentioned, and the statement indicates that differentiation could not be assessed in some samples and is inconclusive overall.
