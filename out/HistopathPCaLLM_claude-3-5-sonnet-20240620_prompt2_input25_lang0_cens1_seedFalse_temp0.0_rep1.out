Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy based on the description of multiple samples and their fragmented nature.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because no specific Gleason score is mentioned, and the statement indicates that differentiation patterns could not be fully assessed.
