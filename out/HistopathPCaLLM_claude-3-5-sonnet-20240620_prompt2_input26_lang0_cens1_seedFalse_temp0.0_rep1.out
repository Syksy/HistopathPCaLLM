Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "material from apex and basis" and samples marked with indices.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not clearly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The histological inspection is described as "very difficult to assess" due to recent radiation therapy.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because although a "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, it is described as unclear whether it's GG 2 or 3, and if the sum was verified. Due to the recent radiation therapy, the histopathology cannot be reasonably used for assessment.
