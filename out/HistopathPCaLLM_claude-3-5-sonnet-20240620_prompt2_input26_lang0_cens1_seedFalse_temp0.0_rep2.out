Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "The studied material originates from the prostate" and refers to samples marked with indices, which suggests this is likely a biopsy. Therefore, "biopsy" is the most appropriate sample type.

2. Malignancy: The statement does not clearly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions a possible "Gleason sum 7" from clinical notes, but also states that the material is "very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy." Given this uncertainty, we cannot definitively say "yes" to malignancy, so "NA" is the most appropriate response.

3. Gleason: Although the statement mentions a possible "Gleason sum 7," it also notes that "it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified." Due to this uncertainty and the difficulty in assessment caused by recent radiation therapy, we cannot provide a definitive Gleason grade. Therefore, "NA" is the most appropriate response.
