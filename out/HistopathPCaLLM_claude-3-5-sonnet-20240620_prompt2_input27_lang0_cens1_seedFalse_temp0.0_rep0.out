Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so it's set to "NA".
2. The malignancy status is ambiguous. While there's mention of possible Gleason score 3, it's described as debatable and in small quantities. Given this uncertainty, we set it to "NA".
3. Although Gleason score 3 is mentioned, it's described as debatable and not definitively reported. Therefore, we set Gleason to "NA".
