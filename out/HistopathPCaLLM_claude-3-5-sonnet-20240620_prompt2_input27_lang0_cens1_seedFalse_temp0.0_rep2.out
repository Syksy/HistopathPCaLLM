Based on the given statement, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so it's marked as "NA".
2. The malignancy status is ambiguous. While there's mention of possible Gleason score 3 in small quantities, it's not a definitive statement of malignancy, so it's marked as "NA".
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as potentially 3, but it's described as debatable and in small quantities. Since it's not a clear, definitive Gleason score, and the format doesn't match the required "major+minor=sum", it's marked as "NA".
