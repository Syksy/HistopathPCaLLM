Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the description of multiple regions of interest being examined.
2. While there are atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes mentioned, there is no definitive statement of malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy is set to "no".
3. As there is no mention of Gleason grading or confirmed malignancy, the Gleason score is set to "NA".
