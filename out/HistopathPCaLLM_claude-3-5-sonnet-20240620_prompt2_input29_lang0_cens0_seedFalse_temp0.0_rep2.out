Based on the provided statement, here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as it mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes multiple sections of the prostate.
2. Malignancy is "yes" as it clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Score sum 7" in the summary. Based on the description of mostly grade 4 with a smaller portion of grade 3, we can infer that the Gleason score is 4+3=7.
