Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. It's described as an "autopsy specimen intended for research use," which doesn't fit into the allowed categories.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions that "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" cannot be reliably inferred due to inflammatory and age-related changes.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.

Given the lack of specific information that fits the required categories, all fields are set to "NA" (Not Available) in the JSON output.
