Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "chippings near the urothelial cells."
2. Malignancy is present, as the statement confirms a diagnosis of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 4 (most common pattern) and 3 (secondary pattern), which translates to "4+3=7". Although a tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned, only the two most prevalent patterns are used in the Gleason score.
