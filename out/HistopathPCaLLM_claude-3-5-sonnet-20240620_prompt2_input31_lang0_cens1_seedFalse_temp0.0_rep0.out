Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "samples were taken," which suggests a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: Although "suspicious findings" are mentioned, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. The findings are inconclusive, so we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy.
3. Gleason: There is no mention of Gleason grading or any specific cancer grading in the statement.
