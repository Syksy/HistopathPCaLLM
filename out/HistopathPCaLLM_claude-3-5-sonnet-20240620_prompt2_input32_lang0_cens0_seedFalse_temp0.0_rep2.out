Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as stated in the first sentence.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because the statement mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate."
3. The Gleason grade reported is "4+4=8". Although multiple Gleason patterns were mentioned (3+3, 3+4, 4+3), we report the most severe lesion as instructed, which is the Gleason 4+4 pattern.
