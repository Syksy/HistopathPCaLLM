Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the mention of "original primary prostate tissue" and examination of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are typically assessed in RP specimens.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the given statement, so malignancy is marked as "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so it is marked as "NA".
