Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the mention of "original primary prostate tissue" and examination of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are typically assessed in RP specimens.
2. The statement does not explicitly mention whether malignant tumor findings were present or not, so this is marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so this is also marked as "NA".
