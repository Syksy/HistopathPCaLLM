Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles", indicating no malignancy was found. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade, so it's set to "NA".
