Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of a "resection weighing 7.5gr".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities".
3. Since no malignancy was found, there is no Gleason grade reported, so it is marked as "NA".
