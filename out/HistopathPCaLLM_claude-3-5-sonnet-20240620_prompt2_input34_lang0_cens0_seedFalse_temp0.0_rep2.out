}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is a resection, which is most likely a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities," so there are no malignant tumor findings.
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
