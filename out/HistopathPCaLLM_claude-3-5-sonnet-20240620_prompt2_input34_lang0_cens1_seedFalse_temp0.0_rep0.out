Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of the sample weight and preparation into tissue cassettes.
2. There are no malignant tumor findings mentioned. The statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer]."
3. As there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
