Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value.
2. There are no malignant tumor findings. The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma."
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's set to "NA".
