Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "left and right lobe" samples, which implies a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: No malignant tumor findings are reported. The statement mentions PIN-changes and hyperplasia, which are not malignant.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
