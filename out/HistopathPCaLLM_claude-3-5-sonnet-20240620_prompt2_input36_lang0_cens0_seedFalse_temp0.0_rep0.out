Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of the specimen weight and size, which is typical for TURP procedures.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity."
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
