Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so it's set to "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's set to "NA".

The statement describes prostate tissue with some glandular components and minor inflammation, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade. The examination was incomplete, and further examination is planned for the future.
