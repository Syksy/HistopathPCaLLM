Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified in the statement, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings", so the malignancy status is uncertain and set to "NA".
3. The statement explicitly says "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point", so it's set to "NA".
