Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. The statement indicates uncertainty about whether the findings are benign or malignant, so malignancy is set to "NA".
3. The statement explicitly mentions that the Gleason score cannot be assessed, so it's set to "NA".
