Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" being removed in a "single run."
2. There is no clear indication of malignancy in the statement. Due to burn artifacts, a conclusive examination couldn't be performed, so we cannot determine if there were malignant findings.
3. As there is no mention of cancer or Gleason grading, and no conclusive examination could be performed, the Gleason score is not applicable.
