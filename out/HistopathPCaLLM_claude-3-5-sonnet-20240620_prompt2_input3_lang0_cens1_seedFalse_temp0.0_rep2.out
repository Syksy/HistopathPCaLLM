Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" being removed in a single run.
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not provide any conclusive information about the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because no information about malignancy or Gleason grading is provided in the statement.
