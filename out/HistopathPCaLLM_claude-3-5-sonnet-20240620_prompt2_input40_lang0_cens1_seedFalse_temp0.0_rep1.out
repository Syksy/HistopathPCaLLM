Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of examined material weight and multiple cassettes used, which is typical for TURP specimens.
2. There is no clear mention of malignancy. The statement only mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. Since there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading, the Gleason field is set to "NA".
