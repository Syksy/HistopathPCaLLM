Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as it mentions samples collected from the prostate lobes.
2. Malignancy is "NA" (Not Available) because the statement indicates it's hard to determine whether there are any cancer-related changes.
3. Gleason score is "NA" as there is no mention of cancer or Gleason grading in the statement.
