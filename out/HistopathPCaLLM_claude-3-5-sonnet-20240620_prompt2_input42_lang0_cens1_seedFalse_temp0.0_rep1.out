Based on the given statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so it's set to "NA".
2. The malignancy status is uncertain as the statement mentions "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined", so it's set to "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade, so it's set to "NA".
