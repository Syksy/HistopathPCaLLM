Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",

  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "prostate samples" and "biopsies".
2. Malignancy is set to "no" because the statement indicates that "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" in the current sample.
3. Gleason score is "NA" because no malignancy is reported in the current sample, and therefore no Gleason grade is provided.
