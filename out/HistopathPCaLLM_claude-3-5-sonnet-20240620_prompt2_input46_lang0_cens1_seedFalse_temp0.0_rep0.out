Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "Prostate material" and "smaller portion of material was run."
2. Malignancy is set to "NA" because the statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not."
3. Gleason score is "NA" as there is no mention of cancer or Gleason grading in the statement.
