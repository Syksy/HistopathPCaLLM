Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "biopsies" from both the right and left sides.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No malign findings on the left or the right," indicating no malignancy.
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).

Note: The "3+4=7" in the statement refers to the total length of biopsies in centimeters, not a Gleason score.
