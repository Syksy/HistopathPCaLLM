Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as it mentions examining material from the right and left sides of the prostate, which is typical for a biopsy procedure.
2. The malignancy status is unclear, as the statement explicitly mentions "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." Therefore, we use "NA" for this field.
3. Since there is no mention of Gleason grades or scores, and the malignancy status is unclear, we use "NA" for the Gleason field.
