Based on the provided statement, here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as it mentions "prostate resection."
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma was found.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 9 tumor" in the summary. Although specific grades are mentioned for different foci, we report the most severe lesion, which is 5+4=9 (Gleason 5 >80% with small portion of Gleason 4 in the second focus).
