Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) as it mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" and describes different parts of the prostate (apex, middle, base) and seminal vesicles.
2. Malignancy is not clearly stated, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. The statement explicitly mentions that Gleason scoring is not applicable in this case, so it's marked as "NA".
