Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) as it mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" and describes processing of the entire prostate including "apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles."
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement does not explicitly mention whether malignant tumors were found or not. It only mentions "Some interesting findings" and "Some exemplifying histological changes," which are not specific enough to determine malignancy.
3. Gleason grade is marked as "NA" because the statement explicitly says "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)."
