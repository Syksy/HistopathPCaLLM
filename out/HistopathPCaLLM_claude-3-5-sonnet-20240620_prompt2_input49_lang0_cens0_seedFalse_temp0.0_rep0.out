Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) as indicated by the mention of "prostate chippings" and "shavings".
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as the statement mentions "5 shavings contained carcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7" because the statement indicates that the most common Gleason class is 3 and the second most common is 4.
