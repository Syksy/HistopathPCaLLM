Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as it mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses," which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. The malignancy status is not clearly stated, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, so it's also marked as "NA".
