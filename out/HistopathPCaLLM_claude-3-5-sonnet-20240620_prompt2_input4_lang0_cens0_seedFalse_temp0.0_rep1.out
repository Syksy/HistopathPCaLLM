Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value.
2. The statement indicates that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, there is no Gleason grade, so "NA" is the appropriate value.
