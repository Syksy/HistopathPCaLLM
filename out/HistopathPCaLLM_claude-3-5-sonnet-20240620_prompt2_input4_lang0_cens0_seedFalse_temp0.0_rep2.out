Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value for Sampletype.
2. The statement indicates that the samples are "representative and benign prostate tissue" and "do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma", so "no" is the correct value for Malignancy.
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, and the statement is about benign findings, "NA" is the appropriate value for Gleason.
