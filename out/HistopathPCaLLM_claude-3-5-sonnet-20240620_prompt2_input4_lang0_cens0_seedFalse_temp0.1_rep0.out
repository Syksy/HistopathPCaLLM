Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value for Sampletype.
2. The statement indicates that the samples are "representative and benign prostate tissue" and "do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma", so "no" is the correct value for Malignancy.
3. Since no malignancy was found, there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, "NA" is the appropriate value for Gleason.
