Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely a "biopsy" as it mentions "Several sampling sites" and "sample material," which is typical for prostate biopsies.
2. Malignancy is "NA" (Not Available) because the statement mentions that "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma."
3. Gleason score is "NA" because no malignancy was definitively reported, and therefore, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
