Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "Several sampling sites" and "sample material".
2. Malignancy is marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for the presence of adenocarcinoma.
3. Gleason score is "NA" as there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading in the statement.
