Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The description suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as it mentions sections from different parts of the prostate (apex, basis) and processing of the entire gland.
2. Malignancy: The statement does not explicitly mention any malignant findings. It describes "clear prostate tissue" across all samples, suggesting no malignancy was found.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is reported, the Gleason score is not applicable (NA).
