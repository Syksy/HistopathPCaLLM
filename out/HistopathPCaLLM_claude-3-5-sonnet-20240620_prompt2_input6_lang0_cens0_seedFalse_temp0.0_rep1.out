Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the description of "shaving chips" which is typical for this procedure.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings reported. The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "benign prostate hyperplasia," indicating no malignancy.
3. As there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
