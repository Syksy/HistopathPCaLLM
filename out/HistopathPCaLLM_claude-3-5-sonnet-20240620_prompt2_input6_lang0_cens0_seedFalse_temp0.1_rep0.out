Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the description of "shaving chips."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings reported. The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "benign prostate hyperplasia."
3. As there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
