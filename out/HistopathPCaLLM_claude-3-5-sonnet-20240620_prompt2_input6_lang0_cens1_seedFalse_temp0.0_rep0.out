Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as the statement mentions "original prostatic operation material."
2. Malignancy is "NA" (Not Available) because the results are described as "inconclusive" due to technical challenges and heavy burn artifact.
3. Gleason score is "NA" (Not Available) as no specific Gleason grade is mentioned, and the results are inconclusive.
