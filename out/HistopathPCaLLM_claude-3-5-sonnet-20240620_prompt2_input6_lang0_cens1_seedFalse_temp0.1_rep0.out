Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is likely "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as it mentions "original prostatic operation material."
2. Malignancy is "NA" (Not Available) because the statement does not clearly indicate the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The results are described as "inconclusive."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as no information about Gleason grading is provided in the statement.
