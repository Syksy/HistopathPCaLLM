Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as the statement mentions "original prostatic operation material."
2. Malignancy is "NA" (Not Available) because the statement does not clearly indicate the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The results are described as "inconclusive."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Available) as there is no mention of any Gleason grading in the statement.
