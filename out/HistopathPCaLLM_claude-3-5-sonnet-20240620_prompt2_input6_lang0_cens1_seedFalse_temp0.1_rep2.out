Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is inferred from "original prostatic operation material."
2. Malignancy: "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively report malignant findings.
3. Gleason: "NA" because no Gleason grade is mentioned, and the results are described as inconclusive.
