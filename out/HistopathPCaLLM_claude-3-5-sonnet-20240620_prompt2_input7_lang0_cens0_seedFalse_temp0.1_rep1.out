Based on the provided statement, here's the structured data in JSON format:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct value.
2. While there is a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, the statement explicitly says that "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet". Therefore, we cannot confirm malignancy, so "no" is the appropriate value.
3. Since no malignancy is confirmed, and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the Gleason value is "NA".
