Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" which suggests a biopsy.
2. Malignancy: Although there is mention of "atypical structures," the statement concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the rest of the material was typical. This indicates no clear malignancy was found.
3. Gleason: As no malignancy was definitively identified, the Gleason score is not applicable (NA).
