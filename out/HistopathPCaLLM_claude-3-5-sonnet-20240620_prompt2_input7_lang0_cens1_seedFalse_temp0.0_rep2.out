Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The statement mentions "prostate sample material," which suggests a biopsy.
2. Malignancy: Although there is mention of "atypical structures and morphological changes," the statement concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the rest of the material was typical. This indicates that no malignancy was definitively found.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy was confirmed, the Gleason score is not applicable (NA).
