Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the mention of "prostate sample material" being collected.
2. Malignancy is set to "no" because although there was a point of interest with atypical structures, no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the rest of the material was typical.
3. Gleason score is "NA" because there was no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading in the statement.
