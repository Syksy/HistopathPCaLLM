Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The statement mentions multiple samples and discusses prostate tissue, which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - While the statement mentions some potentially interesting properties and discusses Gleason patterns, it does not explicitly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The statement also mentions that samples 1 and 2 were free of malignant findings, but it's unclear about sample 3.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Although Gleason patterns are mentioned, the statement indicates that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor grades. No specific Gleason score is reported.
