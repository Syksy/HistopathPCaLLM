Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The statement mentions multiple samples and discusses prostate tissue, which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement does not clearly confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings in the main sample (Sample 3). While it mentions that samples 1 and 2 are free of malignant findings, the status of Sample 3 is not explicitly stated.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Although the statement mentions Gleason patterns, it explicitly states that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor grades. No specific Gleason score is reported.
