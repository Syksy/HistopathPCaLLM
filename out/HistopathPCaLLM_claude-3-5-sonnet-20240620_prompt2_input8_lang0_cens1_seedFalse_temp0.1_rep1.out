Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The statement mentions multiple samples and discusses prostate tissue, which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement does not clearly confirm or deny malignant findings in the main sample (Sample 3). While it mentions potentially interesting properties and discusses Gleason patterns, it does not explicitly state whether malignancy was found. The other samples (1 and 2) were confirmed to be free of malignant findings, but they are not the primary sample of interest.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Although Gleason patterns are mentioned, the statement indicates that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor grades. No specific Gleason score is reported.
