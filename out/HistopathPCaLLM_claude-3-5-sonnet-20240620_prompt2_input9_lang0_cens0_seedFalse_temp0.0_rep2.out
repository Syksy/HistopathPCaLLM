Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "electrosection shavings" obtained as the sample material.
2. There were no malignant findings, as explicitly stated in the text: "No malignant findings are observed".
3. Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
