Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as evidenced by the mention of "electrosection shavings" as the sample material.
2. There were no malignant findings, as explicitly stated in the text: "No malignant findings are observed".
3. Since there were no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
