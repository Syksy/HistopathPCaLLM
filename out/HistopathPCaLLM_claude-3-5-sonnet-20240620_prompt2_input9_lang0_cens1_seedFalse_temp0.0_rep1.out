Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's set to "NA".
2. There are no malignant tumor findings reported. The statement mentions "normal" epithelial cell lining and only mentions disproportionate glandular structures attributed to technical difficulties. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. As there is no mention of malignancy or Gleason grading, the Gleason field is set to "NA".
