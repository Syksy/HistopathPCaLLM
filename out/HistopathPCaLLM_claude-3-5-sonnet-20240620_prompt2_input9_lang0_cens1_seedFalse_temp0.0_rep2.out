Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's marked as "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions normal epithelial cell lining and some disproportionate glandular structures, but no definitive malignancy is reported. Therefore, it's marked as "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, so it's marked as "NA".

The statement primarily describes the processing of the sample and some general observations, but it doesn't provide the specific information required for the structured fields in a conclusive manner.
