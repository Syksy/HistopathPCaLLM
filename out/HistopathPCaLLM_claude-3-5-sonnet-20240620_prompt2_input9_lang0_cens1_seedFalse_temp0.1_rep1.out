Based on the provided statement, I can structure the data as follows:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's marked as "NA".
2. There are no clear malignant tumor findings mentioned, but the statement is inconclusive, so it's marked as "NA".
3. No Gleason grade is reported, so it's marked as "NA".

The statement describes a processing and examination of prostate tissue, but it doesn't provide specific information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The conclusion suggests that the sample processing might have been faulty, and no definitive conclusions could be drawn from the examined material.
