{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I determined these values because:
1. The mention of "chipping samples" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly mentions "benign prostate tissue" and "no... malignancies"
3. Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade is applicable, hence "NA"
