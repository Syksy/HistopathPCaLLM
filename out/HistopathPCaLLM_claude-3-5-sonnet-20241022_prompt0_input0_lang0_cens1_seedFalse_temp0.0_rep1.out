{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: I inferred the sample type as "biopsy" based on the mention of "sample material... run in multiple batches." The statement clearly indicates no definitive malignant findings, and since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA".
