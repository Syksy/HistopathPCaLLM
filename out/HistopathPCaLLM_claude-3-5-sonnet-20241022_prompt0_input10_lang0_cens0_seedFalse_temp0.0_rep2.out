{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've structured the data based on the given text where:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" (systematic biopsies mentioned)
2. Malignant finding is "no" (although there was suspicion, the conclusion leans towards benign and no definitive cancer diagnosis was made)
3. Gleason grade is "NA" (as no malignancy was confirmed)
