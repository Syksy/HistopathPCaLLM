Explanation: The provided text is a technical description of sample handling and staining issues, but does not contain any clear information about the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grading. While it mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material," it doesn't specify whether these are biopsies, RP, or TURP samples. The text focuses on technical issues with staining and sample handling rather than providing any diagnostic information about malignancy or Gleason grading. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (Not Available).
