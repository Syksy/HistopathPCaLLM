Explanation: This statement primarily discusses technical issues with sample handling and staining procedures. It doesn't clearly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), doesn't make any clear statement about malignancy, and consequently doesn't mention any Gleason grades. The text only mentions normal basal cells and some technical issues with staining. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient information for definitive classification.
