Explanation: From this pathology statement, while prostate tissue is mentioned, the specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not clearly stated. Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, it's explicitly stated that they "could not be reliably assessed." No definitive malignant findings are reported. Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" due to insufficient clear information.
