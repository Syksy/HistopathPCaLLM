Note: From this statement, while it appears to be a biopsy report (based on mentions of samples from different locations), there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. The text mentions "suspicious pattern" and "irregularities" but doesn't definitively state malignant findings or provide Gleason grades. Therefore, the malignant finding is marked as "NA" due to the uncertainty, and consequently, no Gleason grade can be provided.
