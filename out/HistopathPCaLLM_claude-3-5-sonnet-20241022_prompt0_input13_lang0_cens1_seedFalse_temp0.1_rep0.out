Note: From this statement, while it appears to be from a prostate biopsy (based on mentions of samples from different locations), there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. The text mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that warrant further inspection, but no definitive cancer diagnosis or Gleason grading is provided. Therefore, I've marked the malignant finding as "NA" since it's pending further verification, and consequently, the Gleason grade is also "NA".
