{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_found": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement:
- The sample type can be inferred as "biopsy" based on the mention of multiple samples from different locations in the prostate
- While there are "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" mentioned, there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy, hence "NA"
- No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text, hence "NA"

The statement is rather inconclusive, suggesting further consultation is needed for definitive diagnosis.
