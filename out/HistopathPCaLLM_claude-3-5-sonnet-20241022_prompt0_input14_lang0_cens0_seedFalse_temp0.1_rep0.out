{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_found": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatetectomy preparate"
2. Malignant findings are present ("yes") as tumor growth is described
3. Gleason grade is reported as 7, with score 3 being the predominant pattern (60%). Therefore, this would be structured as "3+4=7" following the standard Gleason grading convention where the first number is the most prevalent pattern.
