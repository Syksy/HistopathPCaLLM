{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_found": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (prostatectomy)
2. Malignant findings are present ("yes") as tumor growth is described
3. Gleason grade is reported as 7, with majority (60%) being pattern 3, which implies 3+4=7 configuration
