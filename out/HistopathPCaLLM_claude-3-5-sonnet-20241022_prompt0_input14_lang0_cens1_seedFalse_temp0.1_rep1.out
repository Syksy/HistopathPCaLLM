Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it according to the three required fields:

1. Sample Type: While the text mentions tissue samples and cassettes, it's not explicitly clear if this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Without clear indication, this should be marked as "NA".

2. Malignant Findings: While there are mentions of "special patterns of cell growth" and comparison to a Gleason 7 case, there's no definitive statement about malignancy in this specimen. The text suggests further investigation is needed. Therefore, this should be marked as "NA".

3. Gleason Grade: Although a Gleason 7 score is mentioned, this is in reference to a different patient for comparison purposes, not for the current case. Therefore, this should be marked as "NA".

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
