{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I based this structured extraction on the following analysis:
1. "Prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. "confirm adenocarcinoma" clearly indicates malignant findings
3. For Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "sum of 8", which given the dominance of pattern 4, suggests a 4+4=8 grade
