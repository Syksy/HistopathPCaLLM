{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

Note: The sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the mention of "prostate chippings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens. The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy, and while the Gleason grading information is not explicitly stated in traditional format, the mention of "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "sum of 8" allows us to infer a 4+4=8 Gleason score.
