{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type can be inferred as "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight"
- Malignant finding is "NA" because while there is suspicion mentioned in clinical notes, no definitive malignant finding was confirmed in this histopathological examination
- Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that "Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time"

Note: Although the clinical notes mention a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this was not based on histopathological findings from this sample, so it should not be included in the structured data.
