{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the given text:
1. Sample type appears to be a biopsy (based on the mention of "meager weight" tissue material)
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because while there is suspicion, no definitive diagnosis is made ("Potential findings have to be revised")
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because it's explicitly stated that "Gleason... could not be determined at this time"

Note: Although the text mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this was from clinical notes and not confirmed by histopathology, so it should not be included in the structured data.
