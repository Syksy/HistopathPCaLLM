{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type can be inferred as "biopsy" based on the description of "prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight"
- Malignant finding is "NA" because while there is suspicion mentioned in clinical notes, no definitive histopathological confirmation is provided in this statement
- Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that Gleason "could not be determined at this time" (the mentioned Gleason sum of 8 is only from clinical notes/suspicion, not from actual histopathological examination)
