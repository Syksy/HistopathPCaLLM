Explanation: From the given text, while it discusses prostate tissue examination and mentions potential Gleason patterns, the statement is primarily about technical difficulties in assessment due to digital imaging issues. The sample type is not explicitly stated (could be biopsy or RP but it's not specified), malignancy is not definitively confirmed (though suspicious areas are mentioned), and no definitive Gleason grade is assigned. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the report.
