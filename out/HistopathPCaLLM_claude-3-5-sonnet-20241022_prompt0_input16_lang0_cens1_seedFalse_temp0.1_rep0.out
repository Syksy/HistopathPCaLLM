Explanation: From the given text, while it discusses prostate tissue examination and mentions potential Gleason patterns, the statement is primarily about technical difficulties in assessing the digital images. The sample type is not explicitly stated (could be biopsy or RP but it's not specified), malignancy is not definitively confirmed (only "suspicious foci" mentioned), and while Gleason patterns are referenced (3+4 or 4+3), no definitive grade is assigned due to technical limitations. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the report.
