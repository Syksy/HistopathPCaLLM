Explanation: From the given text, while it discusses prostate tissue examination and mentions potential Gleason patterns, the statement is primarily about technical difficulties in assessing the digital images. The sample type is not explicitly stated (could be biopsy or RP but it's not specified). No definitive malignant findings are confirmed, and while Gleason patterns are referenced (3+4 or 4+3), no final grade is actually assigned. Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the report.
