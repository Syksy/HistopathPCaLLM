Explanation: From the given text, while it's discussing prostate tissue examination, it's unclear what type of sample it is (biopsy, RP, or TURP). The text mentions suspicious foci but doesn't definitively confirm malignancy. Regarding Gleason grading, while the text mentions potential mid-grade patterns (3+4 or 4+3), no definitive grade is assigned due to digitalization issues. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the report.
