{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly a prostatectomy (RP) based on "Prostatectomy preparate" mentioned at the start.
2. There are clear malignant findings with multiple tumor foci described.
3. For Gleason grade, the text mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". Since grade 4 is described as dominant, it should be listed first, making it 4+3=7.
