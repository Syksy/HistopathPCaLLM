{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of prostatectomy preparate and the detailed sectioning.
2. There are clear malignant findings with multiple tumor foci described.
3. The Gleason grading mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which indicates a 4+3=7 pattern where grade 4 is predominant and grade 3 is secondary.
