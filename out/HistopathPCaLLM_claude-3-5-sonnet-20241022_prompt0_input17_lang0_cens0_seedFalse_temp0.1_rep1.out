{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

I determined this structure based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "Prostatectomy preparate" in the text.
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as there are clear descriptions of tumor findings with Gleason grades.
3. Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7" because the text mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", indicating grade 4 is primary and grade 3 is secondary.
