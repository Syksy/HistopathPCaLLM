{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the detailed processing description of a prostatectomy specimen.
2. There are clear malignant findings with multiple tumor foci described.
3. For Gleason grade, the text mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". Since grade 4 is described as dominant, with grade 3 as secondary, this translates to Gleason 4+3=7.
