{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this text:
- The sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples (A-O) taken from different parts of the prostate.
- No definitive malignant findings are reported; the text only mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades but doesn't actually provide any findings.
- No specific Gleason grade is reported; only a theoretical range (3-5) is mentioned in the context of future assessment.

Therefore, both malignant_finding and gleason_grade are set to "NA" as no conclusive diagnostic information is provided in this preliminary report.
