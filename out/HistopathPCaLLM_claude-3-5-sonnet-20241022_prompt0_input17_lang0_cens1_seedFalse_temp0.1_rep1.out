    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this text:
- The sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples (A-O) taken from different parts of the prostate.
- No definitive malignant findings are reported; the text only mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades but doesn't actually provide any findings, hence "NA".
- While Gleason grades 3-5 are mentioned, they are only referenced as potential assessment criteria, not as actual findings, therefore "NA".
