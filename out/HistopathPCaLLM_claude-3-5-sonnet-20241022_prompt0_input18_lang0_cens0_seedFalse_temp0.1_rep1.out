{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. The mention of "chippings" and "shaving procedure" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. There is a clear mention of carcinoma, indicating malignant findings.
3. The Gleason sum is explicitly stated as 7, and since it mentions "stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area," this indicates a primary pattern of 3 and secondary pattern of 4, resulting in "3+4=7".
