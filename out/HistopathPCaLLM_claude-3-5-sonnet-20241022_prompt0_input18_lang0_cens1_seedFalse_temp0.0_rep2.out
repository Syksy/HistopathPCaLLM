{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP), so "NA" is assigned
- While there is a suspicious focus mentioned, it's too small to grade and >95% is benign. Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, this is best classified as "no" for malignant findings
- Since no definitive malignancy is diagnosed and no specific Gleason grades are assigned, the Gleason grade is "NA"
