{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP), so "NA" is assigned
- While there is a suspicious focus mentioned, it's not definitively diagnosed as malignant, and >95% is described as benign. Given the uncertainty and predominant benign nature, this is best classified as "no" for malignant findings
- Since no definitive malignancy is diagnosed, and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned (only a speculative reference to possible ISUP GG 1), Gleason grade is "NA"
