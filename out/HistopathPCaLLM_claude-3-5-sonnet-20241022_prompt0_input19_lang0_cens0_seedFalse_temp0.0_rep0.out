{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies"
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason grade is derived from the most severe lesion (sample 4), where there is 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. Following standard Gleason grading rules, this would be reported as 3+4=7, where the primary (most prevalent) pattern is 3 and the secondary (lesser) pattern is 4.
