Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations. Sample 1) 10mm, 2) 8mm, 3) 14mm and 4) 14mm in material amount. Sample 1 is unrepresentative of the prostate, while samples 2 and 3 represent healthy benign prostate tissue. In sample 4, the whole cylinder's length appears to contain adenocarcinoma, with the larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%). Breaching of the capsule or perineural invasion is not suspected based on the current sample material, although definitive inspection would require imaging.
