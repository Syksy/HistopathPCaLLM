{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies"
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as adenocarcinoma was found in sample 4
3. Gleason grade is derived from the most severe lesion (sample 4), where Gleason 3 pattern is dominant (90%) and Gleason 4 is minor (10%), thus forming 3+4=7
