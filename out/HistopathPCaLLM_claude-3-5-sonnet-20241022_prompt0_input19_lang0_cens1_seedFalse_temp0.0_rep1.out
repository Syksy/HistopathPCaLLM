{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_found": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text:
1. Sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the mention of "cylinders" and multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignancy status is "NA" because while there is a suspicious finding in sample 4, it's inconclusive and requires verification of lab procedures before confirmation.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as no definitive cancer diagnosis was made and therefore no Gleason grading was performed.
