{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_found": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the mention of "cylinders" and multiple samples being processed.
- Malignant findings are "NA" because while sample 4 shows abnormal features, there is uncertainty about the tissue origin and no definitive malignancy diagnosis is made.
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy is definitively diagnosed and therefore no Gleason grading is provided.
