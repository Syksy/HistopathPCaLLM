{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text:
1. Sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the mention of "cylinders" and multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because while there is a suspicious area in sample 4, no definitive malignancy is confirmed, and further verification is needed.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy is definitively diagnosed and therefore no Gleason grading is provided.
