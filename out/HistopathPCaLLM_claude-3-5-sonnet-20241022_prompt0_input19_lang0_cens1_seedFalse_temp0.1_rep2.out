{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_found": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text:
1. Sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the mention of "cylinders" and multiple samples being processed.
2. Malignancy status is "NA" because while sample 4 shows abnormal features, there is uncertainty about the tissue origin and no definitive malignancy diagnosis is made.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy is definitively diagnosed and therefore no Gleason grading is provided.
