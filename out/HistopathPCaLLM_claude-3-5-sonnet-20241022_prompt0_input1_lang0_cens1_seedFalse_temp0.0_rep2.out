{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the mention of "standard locations" and "samples" which is typical biopsy terminology
- Malignant findings are "NA" because the statement explicitly says results are "inconclusive"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no specific Gleason scores are mentioned and findings are inconclusive
