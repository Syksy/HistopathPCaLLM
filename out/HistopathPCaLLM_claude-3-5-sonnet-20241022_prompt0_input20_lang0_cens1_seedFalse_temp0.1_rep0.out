{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text, we can determine that:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate tissue samples" divided into sets from different regions.
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because the text explicitly states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because although the text hypothetically mentions "3+4", no actual Gleason grading was possible due to the affected tissue state.
