{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings"
- Malignant finding is "yes" based on the description of poorly differentiated growth and tumor-like tissue
- Gleason grade is reported as most common being 5 and second most common being 4, which translates to 5+4=9 in the standard format
