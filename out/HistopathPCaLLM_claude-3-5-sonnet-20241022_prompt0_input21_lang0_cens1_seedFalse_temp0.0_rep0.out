{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text description:
1. Sample type appears to be TURP based on the mention of "extracted prostate material" in fragments measured in grams
2. Malignant finding cannot be determined due to poor quality of the sample and dissolved nuclei ("NA")
3. Gleason grade cannot be determined due to quality issues ("NA")

The statement primarily discusses quality control issues with the specimen, making definitive assessment of malignancy and Gleason grading impossible.
