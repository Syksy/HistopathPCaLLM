{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text description:
1. Sample type can be determined as "TURP" based on the mention of "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement.
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because the quality of the sample is too poor to make a definitive assessment.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because no cancer diagnosis or grading could be performed due to poor sample quality and technical issues.
