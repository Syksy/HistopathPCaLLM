{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement:
- The sample type appears to be TURP based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in "fragments"
- Due to poor quality (dissolved nuclei, technical noise, QC issues), no definitive assessment of malignancy could be made, hence "NA"
- Similarly, no Gleason grade could be determined due to quality issues, hence "NA"
