{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "thick needle biopsies"
- Malignant finding is "yes" as carcinoma is found in the left side fragments
- Gleason grade is reported as 3 being primary and 4 being secondary pattern, thus structured as "3+4=7". This is derived from the left side findings which represent the most severe lesion in the material.
