{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of prostate tissue sampling with specific fragment lengths from left and right sides
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions that samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no definitive Gleason grading could be performed due to the poor quality of the samples and need for reprocessing
