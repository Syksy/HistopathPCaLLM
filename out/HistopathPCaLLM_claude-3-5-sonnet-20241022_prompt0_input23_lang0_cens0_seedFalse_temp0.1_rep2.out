{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is prostatectomy (RP)
2. Malignant finding is present (adenocarcinoma)
3. Gleason grade is derived from the two most prevalent patterns: primary pattern 4 (60%) and secondary pattern 5 (30%). The tertiary pattern 3 is minimal and not included in the final score. This matches with the explicitly stated Gleason score of 9.
