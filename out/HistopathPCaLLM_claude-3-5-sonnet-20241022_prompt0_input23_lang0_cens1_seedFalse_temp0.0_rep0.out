Explanation: This statement appears to be a procedural note discussing the need for reprocessing of samples, with a mention of a prior incomplete report. While there is a reference to potential Gleason 3 findings in a previous examination, this current report doesn't make any definitive diagnosis. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" since no conclusive findings are presented in this particular statement.
