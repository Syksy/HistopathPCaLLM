}

Explanation: This statement appears to be a procedural note discussing the need for reprocessing samples with a focus on the apex area. While there is a mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior report, this is not a definitive current finding. The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, doesn't make a definitive malignancy determination, and doesn't provide a complete current Gleason grade. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA".
