{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_found": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I've structured the data based on the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "turp-chippings", indicating this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) sample.

2. Malignant findings: Yes, the text clearly indicates malignant findings, describing Gleason 4 tumor growth and concluding with adenocarcinoma diagnosis.

3. Gleason grade: The text mentions Gleason 4 class tumor growth and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Since it's described as Gleason 4 pattern throughout without mention of other patterns, this would be interpreted as 4+4=8.
