{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_found": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I've analyzed the text and structured it according to the requirements:

1. Sample type is TURP (identified from "turp-chippings")
2. Malignant findings are present ("yes" - confirmed by adenocarcinoma finding)
3. Gleason grade is derived from the text mentioning "Gleason 4" and "sum 8", which implies 4+4=8

The JSON response provides the most severe findings in a non-nested format with the requested fields.
