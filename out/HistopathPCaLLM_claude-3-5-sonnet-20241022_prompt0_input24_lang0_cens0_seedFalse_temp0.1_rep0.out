{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_found": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I've structured the data based on the histopathological statement provided. Here's how I determined each value:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "turp-chippings", indicating this is a TURP sample.

2. Malignant findings: The text clearly indicates malignant findings, describing Gleason 4 tumor growth and concluding with adenocarcinoma.

3. Gleason grade: The text mentions Gleason 4 class tumor growth and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Since it's described as Gleason 4 pattern and sums to 8, this indicates a 4+4=8 grade.
