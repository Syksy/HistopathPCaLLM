{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

I chose these values because:
1. Although multiple sample types are mentioned (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings), we can't determine which specific sample type relates to the most severe finding, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. "malignant_finding" is "yes" because the text mentions upgrading to Gleason scores, indicating malignant findings.
3. For Gleason grade, I selected "3+4=7" as it represents the highest grade mentioned in the text ("3+4" is higher than "3+3").
