{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

I provided this structured output based on the following analysis:

1. Sample type: Although biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings are mentioned, they are referred to as multiple different types without specifying which one relates to the most severe finding. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.

2. Malignant finding: "yes" because the text mentions upgrading to Gleason scores, which indicates malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: "3+4=7" because among the mentioned grades (3+3 and 3+4), 3+4 represents the most severe finding mentioned in the text.
