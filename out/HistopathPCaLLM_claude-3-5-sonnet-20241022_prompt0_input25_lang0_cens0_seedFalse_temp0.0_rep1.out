{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is clearly biopsy based on the description of tissue cylinders with measurements in mm
- Malignant finding is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is explicitly mentioned in the conclusion
- For Gleason grade, looking at the most severe lesion (Sample 1), there are Gleason 4 (20%) and Gleason 3 (30%) patterns. Since Gleason 3 pattern is more prevalent (30% vs 20%), this makes it 3+4=7. The convention is to report the most prevalent pattern first, followed by the second most prevalent pattern.
