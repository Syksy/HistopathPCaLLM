{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is clearly biopsy based on the description of tissue cylinders and their measurements.
- Malignant finding is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is explicitly mentioned in the conclusion.
- For Gleason grade, looking at the most severe lesion (Sample 1), there are Gleason 4 (20%) and Gleason 3 (30%) patterns. Following standard grading practice, this would be reported as 3+4=7, where the most prevalent pattern (Gleason 3) is primary and the highest grade (Gleason 4) is secondary.
