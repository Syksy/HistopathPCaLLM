{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "biopsy" based on the description of multiple samples and tissue sample shapes
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly says that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no definitive cancer diagnosis was made and no Gleason scores were reported
