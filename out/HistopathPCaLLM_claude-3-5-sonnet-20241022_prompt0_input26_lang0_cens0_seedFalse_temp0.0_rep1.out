{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

I determined this structure based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as text clearly describes a tumor
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" because text mentions "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent", indicating pattern 3 is primary and pattern 4 is secondary
