Explanation: While this is a prostate specimen, the exact sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP) is not explicitly mentioned. Although there is a mention of "Gleason sum 7", it is noted as uncertain clinical information and not a confirmed histopathological finding. Due to radiation therapy effects, the tissue cannot be properly assessed. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the uncertainty and inability to make definitive assessments.
