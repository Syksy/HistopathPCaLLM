Explanation: While this is clearly a prostate specimen, the specific sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP) is not explicitly stated. Although there is mention of a possible "Gleason sum 7", it is noted as uncertain and cannot be verified due to radiation therapy effects. The presence of malignancy also cannot be definitively determined from this statement due to the radiation therapy changes making assessment difficult. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the uncertainty and inability to make definitive assessments.
