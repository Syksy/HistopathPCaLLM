{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: The statement is somewhat ambiguous, but I structured it as follows:
- Sample type is unclear from the text, hence "NA"
- While there's mention of possible Gleason 3 pattern, it's described as debatable and in small quantities, and the text suggests the patterns don't follow normal prostate tumor differentiation. Therefore, this shouldn't be considered a clear malignant finding
- Since there's no clear malignant finding, Gleason grade is marked as "NA"
