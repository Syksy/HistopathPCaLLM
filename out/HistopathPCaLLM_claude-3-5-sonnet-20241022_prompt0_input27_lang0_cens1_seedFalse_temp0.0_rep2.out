{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: The statement is somewhat ambiguous, but I structured it as follows:
- Sample type is unclear from the text, hence "NA"
- While there's mention of possible Gleason 3 pattern, it's described as debatable and in small quantities. The statement suggests the patterns mostly don't follow prostate tumor differentiation, so this is most reasonably interpreted as "no" for malignant findings
- Since no definitive malignant finding is made, Gleason grade is "NA"
