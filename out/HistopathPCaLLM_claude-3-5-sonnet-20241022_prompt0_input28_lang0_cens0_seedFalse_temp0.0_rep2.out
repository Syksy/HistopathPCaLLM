{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text clearly states "six biopsy cylinders"
2. There are multiple malignant findings (adenocarcinoma)
3. Among the three foci described (4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7), focus #1 had the highest Gleason grade of 4+4=8, which should be reported as the most severe finding
