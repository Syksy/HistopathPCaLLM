{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: 
- Sample type is "biopsy" as it mentions multiple sites of interest being examined, which is typical for prostate biopsies.
- While there are mentions of atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, so malignant_finding is "no".
- Since no malignancy is confirmed, there can't be a Gleason grade, hence "NA".
