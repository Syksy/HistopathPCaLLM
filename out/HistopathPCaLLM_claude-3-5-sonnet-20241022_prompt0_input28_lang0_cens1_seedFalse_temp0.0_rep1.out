{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: 
- Sample type is "biopsy" as the text mentions multiple sites of interest being examined, which is typical for prostate biopsies.
- While there are mentions of "atypical growth patterns" and "possible pre-malignant changes", no definitive malignant findings are reported. The findings are described as requiring "further inspection".
- Since no malignancy is definitively diagnosed, no Gleason grade is provided, hence "NA".
