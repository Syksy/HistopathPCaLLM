{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a complete prostate specimen with weight and systematic sampling from different planes.
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as invasive adenocarcinoma is clearly described.
3. Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7" because:
   - The statement mentions "mostly grade 4" (indicating primary pattern)
   - "with the smaller portion as grade 4" appears to be a typo and context suggests this should be grade 3
   - Summary explicitly states "Score sum 7"
   - When grade 4 is predominant with a total score of 7, this indicates a 4+3=7 pattern
