{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a complete prostate specimen with weight and systematic sampling from different planes.
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as invasive adenocarcinoma is clearly described.
3. Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7" based on the description stating "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" and "Score sum 7". Note that there appears to be a typo in the original text (both portions mentioned as grade 4), but the sum of 7 and context suggests it should be 4+3=7.
