{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the description of a complete prostate specimen with systematic sampling from different regions (apex, middle, higher plane) and mention of weight.
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as invasive adenocarcinoma is clearly described.
3. Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7". While the text mentions "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4" (which seems to be a typo and likely meant grade 3), combined with the explicit statement of "Score sum 7", we can determine this is a 4+3=7 pattern where grade 4 is predominant.
