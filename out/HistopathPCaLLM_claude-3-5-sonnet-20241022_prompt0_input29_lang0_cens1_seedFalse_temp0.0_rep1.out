{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: From this pathology statement:
- The sample type can be determined as "biopsy" based on the description of multiple targeted samples (A-F) being taken from different locations of the prostate.
- Regarding malignant findings, the statement is inconclusive. While there are mentions of examining potential poor differentiation and glandular structures, no definitive malignant findings are reported, and the statement indicates that proper assessment couldn't be made due to sample quality issues.
- No Gleason grade is provided in the text, and the statement explicitly mentions that "Score sum determination was not possible."

Therefore, while we can determine the sample type, both the malignant finding status and Gleason grade must be marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the examination.
