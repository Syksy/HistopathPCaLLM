{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning: 
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of multiple targeted samples (A-F) from different locations of the prostate
- Malignant finding is "NA" because while there are suggestions of examining potential poor differentiation, no clear malignant findings are definitively stated
- Gleason grade is "NA" as the statement explicitly mentions "Score sum determination was not possible"
