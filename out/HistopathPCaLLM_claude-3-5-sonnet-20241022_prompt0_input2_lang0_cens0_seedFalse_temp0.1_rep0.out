{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I arrived at this structured data because:
1. The text mentions "prostatectomy specimen" which indicates this is an RP (radical prostatectomy) sample
2. The findings are explicitly benign with mentions of "normal benign growth" and no mention of cancer or malignancy
3. Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
