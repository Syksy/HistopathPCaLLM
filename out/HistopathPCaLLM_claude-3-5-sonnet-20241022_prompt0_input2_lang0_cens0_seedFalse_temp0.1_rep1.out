{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_findings": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I arrived at this structured data because:
1. The text mentions "prostatectomy specimen" which indicates this is an RP (Radical Prostatectomy) sample
2. The findings are explicitly benign ("normal benign growth" and no mention of cancer/malignancy)
3. Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
