{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is "NA" because while it's mentioned as an autopsy specimen, it doesn't fit into the allowed categories (biopsy, RP, TURP).
- Malignant finding is "NA" because no definitive malignancy is reported; the statement only mentions potential adenocarcinoma requiring further inspection.
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignancy is definitively diagnosed, and thus no Gleason grading is provided.
