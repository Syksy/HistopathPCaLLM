{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text (only mentioned as "autopsy specimen"), so "NA"
- Malignant findings are inconclusive ("cannot be reliable inferred"), so "NA"
- No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since malignancy is inconclusive, "NA"
