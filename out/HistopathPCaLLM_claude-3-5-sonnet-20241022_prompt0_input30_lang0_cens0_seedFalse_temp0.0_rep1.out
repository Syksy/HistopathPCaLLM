{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the mention of "chippings"
- Malignant finding is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is confirmed
- Gleason grade is reported as 4 (primary) + 3 (secondary) = 7. Although there is mention of tertiary pattern 5, according to grading rules, only the two most prevalent patterns are included in the final grade. The most severe/recent finding should be reported (4+3), not the prior grade (3+3).
