Explanation: This statement is a consultation note discussing diagnostic uncertainty. It doesn't specify the sample type, doesn't confirm malignancy (explicitly states uncertainty), and consequently doesn't mention any Gleason grades. Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" as the information is not available or conclusive.
