{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text describes multiple biopsies (both systematic and targeted), making the sample type "biopsy"
2. There are clear malignant findings, hence "yes"
3. For the Gleason grade, I selected the most severe finding (4+5=9) from the targeted biopsy, which showed primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5. Although an earlier Gleason 3+3=6 was mentioned, we should report the most severe finding.
