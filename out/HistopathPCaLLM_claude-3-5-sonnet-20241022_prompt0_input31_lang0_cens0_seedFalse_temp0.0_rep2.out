{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text describes multiple biopsies (both systematic and targeted), so sample type is "biopsy"
2. There are clear malignant findings, so "yes"
3. For Gleason grade, I selected the most severe finding mentioned (4+5=9 from the targeted biopsy), not the earlier 3+3=6, as per instructions to return the most severe lesion results
