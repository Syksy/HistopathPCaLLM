Note: From this statement, while it's implied that biopsies were taken ("samples were taken"), the actual malignancy status is unclear as only "suspicious findings" are mentioned without definitive diagnosis. No Gleason grade is mentioned. Therefore, I've marked malignant_findings and gleason_grade as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.
