Note: From this statement, while it's implied that biopsies were taken ("samples were taken"), the actual malignancy status is unclear as only "suspicious findings" are mentioned without definitive diagnosis. The Gleason grade is not mentioned at all. Therefore, while we can determine the sample type as "biopsy", the other fields must be marked as "NA" due to insufficient clear information.
