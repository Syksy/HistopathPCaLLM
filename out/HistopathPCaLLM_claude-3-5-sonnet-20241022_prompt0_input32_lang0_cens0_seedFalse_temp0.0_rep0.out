{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text clearly states "radical prostatectomy" (RP)
2. There is a clear malignant finding ("multifocal adenocarcinoma")
3. For Gleason grade, multiple patterns were mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), but as per instructions to return the most severe lesion, I selected 4+4=8 as it represents the highest grade mentioned.
