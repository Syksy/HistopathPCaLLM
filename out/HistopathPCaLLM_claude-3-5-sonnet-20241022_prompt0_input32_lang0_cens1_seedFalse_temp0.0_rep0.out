}

Note: From the given text, I can only definitively determine that this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen because it mentions "seminal vesicles" and "lymph nodes" which are typically only present in RP specimens. However, the text doesn't provide clear information about malignancy or Gleason grade, so these fields are marked as "NA".
