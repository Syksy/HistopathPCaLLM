Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_findings": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text, hence "NA"
- While the text mentions "no malignant findings in seminal vehicles," it's unclear about overall malignancy status, hence "NA"
- No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text, hence "NA"

The provided text is quite general and lacks specific diagnostic information needed to make definitive determinations for any of the requested fields.
