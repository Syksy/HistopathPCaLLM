Note: The provided text does not contain specific information about the sample type, clear malignancy status, or Gleason grade. While it mentions some anatomical structures (lymph nodes, seminal vesicles) and suggests there are pathological findings, it lacks the specific details needed to determine any of the requested fields with certainty. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA".
