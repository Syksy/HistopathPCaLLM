Explanation:
- Sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the description of a resection with weight measurement
- No malignant findings as explicitly stated ("Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities")
- Gleason grade is "NA" as this is a benign finding
