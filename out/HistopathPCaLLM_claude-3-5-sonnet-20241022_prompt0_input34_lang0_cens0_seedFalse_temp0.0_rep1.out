{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the mention of "resection" and the weight of the specimen, which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- Malignant finding is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because this is a benign finding without malignancy
