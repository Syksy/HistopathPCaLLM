}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the weight measurement and tissue cassette preparation, which is typical for transurethral resection specimens
- No malignant findings are reported; the description mentions hyperplastic tissue with inflammation
- Since no malignancy is found, Gleason grade is "NA"
