{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the weight measurement and tissue cassette preparation, which is typical for transurethral resection specimens
- No malignancy is reported; the findings describe hyperplastic tissue with inflammation
- Since no malignancy is present, Gleason grade is "NA"
