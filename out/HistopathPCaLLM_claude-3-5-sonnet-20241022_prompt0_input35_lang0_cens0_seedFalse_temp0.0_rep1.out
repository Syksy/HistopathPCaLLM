{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've structured the data based on the histopathological statement provided. Here's the reasoning:

1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignant finding is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma" and only mentions benign findings (PIN-changes and hyperplasia)
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because there is no malignancy reported, and therefore no Gleason grade can be assigned
