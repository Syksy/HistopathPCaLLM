{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: I inferred this was a biopsy based on the mention of "left and right lobe" samples. The statement only mentions PIN changes and hyperplasia, which are non-malignant findings, hence "no" for malignant tumor and "NA" for Gleason grade as no cancer was reported.
