Note: I inferred this is a TURP sample based on the weight and size of the specimen, which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens. The statement clearly indicates no malignancy ("No signs of malignity"), and since it's benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA").
