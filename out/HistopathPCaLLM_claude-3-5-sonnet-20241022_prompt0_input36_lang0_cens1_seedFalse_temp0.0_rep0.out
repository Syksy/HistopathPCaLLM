{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: I inferred the sample type as "RP" based on the mention of multiple cassettes and macroscopic examination, which is typical for radical prostatectomy specimens. The statement indicates benign findings (nodular and epithelial hyperplasia) with no mention of malignancy, hence "malignant_tumor" is "no" and "gleason_grade" is "NA".
