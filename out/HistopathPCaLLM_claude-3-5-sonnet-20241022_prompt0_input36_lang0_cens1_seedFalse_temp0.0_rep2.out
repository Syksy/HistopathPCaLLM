{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: I inferred the sample type as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the mention of multiple cassettes and macroscopic examination, though this could be debated. The statement clearly shows benign findings (nodular and epithelial hyperplasia) with no mention of malignancy, hence "malignant_tumor" is "no" and "gleason_grade" is "NA" as it's a benign case.
