Explanation: The provided text does not clearly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). It only mentions prostate tissue with nodular components and inflammation, but no clear malignant findings are described. Since the examination was incomplete and pending further analysis, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient information to make definitive determinations.
