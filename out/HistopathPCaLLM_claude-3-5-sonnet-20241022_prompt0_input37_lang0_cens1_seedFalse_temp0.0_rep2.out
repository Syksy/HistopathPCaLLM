Explanation: From this statement, we cannot definitively determine the sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP), and there is no clear indication of malignancy or Gleason grading. The statement only describes partial examination of prostate tissue with nodular components and minor inflammation, with further examination pending. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (Not Available).
