{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is not clearly specified in the text, hence "NA"
- No malignant findings are mentioned, only hyperplastic tissue with inflammation, hence "no"
- Since no malignancy is present, Gleason grade is "NA"
