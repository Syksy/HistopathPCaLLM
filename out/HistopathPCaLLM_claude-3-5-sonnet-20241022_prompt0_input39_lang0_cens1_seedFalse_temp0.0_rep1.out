{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is not clearly stated in the text, hence "NA"
- Malignancy status is explicitly stated as uncertain ("not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings"), hence "NA"
- Gleason score is explicitly stated as not assessable ("cannot be assessed"), hence "NA"
