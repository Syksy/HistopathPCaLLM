{
    "sample_type": "TURP",

    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings"
- No malignant findings ("Nothing indicating malignancy is found")
- Gleason grade is NA since this is a benign finding (only stromal hyperplasia and inflammation noted)
