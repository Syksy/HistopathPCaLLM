    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: I inferred the sample type as "TURP" based on the mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" in a "single run," which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens. The malignant finding and Gleason grade are marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that the examination was inconclusive due to burn artifacts.
