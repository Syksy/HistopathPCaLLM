{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've structured the data based on the provided prostate histopathology statement. Here's the reasoning:

1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "systematic biopsies"
2. Malignant finding is "no" as it explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because there is no cancer present, and therefore no Gleason grade can be assigned
