{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is "biopsy" as it mentions samples collected from prostate lobes
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions uncertainty about cancer-related changes
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no cancer was definitively diagnosed and no Gleason scores were mentioned
