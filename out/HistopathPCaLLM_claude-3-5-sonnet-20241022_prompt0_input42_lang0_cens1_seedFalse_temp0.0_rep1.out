{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_tumor": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is unclear from the statement (could be biopsy or TURP), so marked as "NA"
- Malignant findings are uncertain ("cannot be determined"), so marked as "NA"
- Since malignancy is uncertain, no Gleason grade can be assigned, so marked as "NA"
