{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_tumor": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I determined these values because:
1. "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since no cancer was found, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
