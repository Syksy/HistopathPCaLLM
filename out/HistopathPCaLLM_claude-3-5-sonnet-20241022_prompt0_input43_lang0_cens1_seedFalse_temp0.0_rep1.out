Note: I determined this is a TURP sample based on the mention of "30g prostate samples" which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens. The malignancy status is "NA" because the statement indicates that "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade is also "NA."
