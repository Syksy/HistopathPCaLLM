Note: I determined this is a TURP sample based on the mention of "30g prostate samples" which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens. The malignant findings are marked as "NA" because the statement indicates uncertainty ("no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached"). Since there's no confirmed cancer, the Gleason grade is also "NA".
