{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "biopsy" based on the mention of "biopsies" in the note.
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes."
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no current malignancy is reported (despite mention of earlier cancer findings).
