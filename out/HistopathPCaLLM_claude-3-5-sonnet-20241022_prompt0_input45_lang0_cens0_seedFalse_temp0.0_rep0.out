{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}

I'll explain my reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as it's described as "whole prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignant finding is "yes" as there is a tumor focus described with Gleason patterns
3. Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the description mentioning "classes 3+4" and the pattern description matches Gleason patterns (separated glands being pattern 3, and converging glands being pattern 4)
