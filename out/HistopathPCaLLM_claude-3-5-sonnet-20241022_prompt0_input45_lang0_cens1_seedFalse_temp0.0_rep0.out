{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement, I cannot definitively determine:
1. The sample type (could be biopsy or RP but not explicitly stated)
2. Whether there are definitive malignant findings (statement is inconclusive with "suspect" and "structure is unclear")
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text

Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" due to insufficient or unclear information.
