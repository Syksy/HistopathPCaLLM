{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the given text, it's difficult to definitively determine:
1. The sample type isn't clearly stated (could be biopsy or RP but not explicitly mentioned)
2. While there's a "suspect" focus mentioned, there's no clear confirmation of malignancy
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text

The statement ends noting that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "further inspection is needed," which further supports using "NA" for all fields due to the uncertainty.
