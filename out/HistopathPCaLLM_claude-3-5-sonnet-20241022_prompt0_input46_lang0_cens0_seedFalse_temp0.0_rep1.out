{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I determined these values because:
1. "Shaved prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Since there is no cancer, there can't be a Gleason grade, hence "NA"
