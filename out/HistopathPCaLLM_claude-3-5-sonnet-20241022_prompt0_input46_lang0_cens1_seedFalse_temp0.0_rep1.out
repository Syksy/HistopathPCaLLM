{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is unclear from the text (could be biopsy or TURP), so marked as "NA"
- Malignant finding is explicitly stated as unable to assess ("Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"), so marked as "NA"
- Since no cancer was definitively diagnosed, Gleason grade is "NA"
