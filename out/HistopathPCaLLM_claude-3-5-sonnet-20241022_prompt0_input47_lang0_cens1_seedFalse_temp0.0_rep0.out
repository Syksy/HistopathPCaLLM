{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" based on the description of examining material from right and left sides with measurements.
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly says they were "not able to determine whether there is malign findings."
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignancy was definitively identified, and thus no Gleason grade could be assigned.
