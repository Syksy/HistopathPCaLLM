{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "biopsy" based on the description of examining material from right and left sides with measurements.
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement explicitly says they were not able to determine whether there are malign findings.
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy was definitively identified, and therefore no Gleason grading could be performed.
