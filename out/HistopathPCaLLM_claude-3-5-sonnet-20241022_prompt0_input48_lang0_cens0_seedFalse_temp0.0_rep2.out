{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly a prostate resection (RP) based on the description "prostate resection weighing 100g"
2. Malignant finding is present ("adenocarcinoma" found)
3. For Gleason grade, the statement describes two foci:
   - First focus: Gleason 4+3
   - Second focus: Gleason 5+4 (with 5 being >80%)
   The most severe lesion is the second focus with Gleason 5+4=9, which is also confirmed in the summary statement "Gleason 9 tumor"
