Explanation: This appears to be an educational/demonstration case using autopsy material. The text explicitly states that Gleason scoring is not applicable, and there's no clear indication of malignancy or specific sample type for clinical purposes. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (Not Applicable).
