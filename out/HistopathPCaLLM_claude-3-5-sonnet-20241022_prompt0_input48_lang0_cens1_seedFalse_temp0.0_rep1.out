Explanation: This appears to be an educational/demonstration case using autopsy material. The text explicitly states that Gleason scoring is not applicable, and it's not clear if there are actual malignant findings or just "interesting patterns." The sample type doesn't clearly fit into biopsy/RP/TURP categories as it's autopsy material used for educational purposes. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to the non-diagnostic nature of this specimen.
