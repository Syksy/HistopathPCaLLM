Explanation:
- Sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings" and "shavings"
- Malignant finding is "yes" as carcinoma was found in 5 shavings
- Gleason grade is reported as most common being 3 and second most common being 4, which translates to Gleason 3+4=7
