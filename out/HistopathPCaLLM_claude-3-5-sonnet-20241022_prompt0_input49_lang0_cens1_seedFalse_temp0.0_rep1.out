    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: From the given text, we can infer it's a biopsy due to mention of multiple samples on glasses, but the malignancy status is unclear as the statement only mentions "changes that warrant further investigation" without specifying their nature. Therefore, malignant_finding is marked as "NA". Without any clear cancer diagnosis or Gleason grading information, the gleason_grade is also marked as "NA".
