{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've analyzed the histopathological statement and structured the data according to the specified fields:

1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations"
2. Malignant finding is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "benign prostate tissue" and "samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported
