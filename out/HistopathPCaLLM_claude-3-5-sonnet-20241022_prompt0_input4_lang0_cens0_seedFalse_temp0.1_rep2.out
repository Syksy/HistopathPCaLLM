{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've analyzed the text and structured it according to the requirements:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignant finding is "no" as the text explicitly states the tissue is benign and "do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason grade is "NA" as this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported
