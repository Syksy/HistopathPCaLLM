{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "biopsy" based on the mention of "several sampling sites" and "sample parts"
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement indicates that the sample is insufficient for reliable assessment
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignancy is reported and assessment was inconclusive
