{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The specimen is explicitly stated to be a "radical prostatectomy" (RP)
2. There are clear malignant findings with cancerous tissue described
3. For the Gleason grade, I reported the most severe finding (4+5=9 from macro B), as per instructions, rather than the less severe 4+3 pattern also mentioned in the text
