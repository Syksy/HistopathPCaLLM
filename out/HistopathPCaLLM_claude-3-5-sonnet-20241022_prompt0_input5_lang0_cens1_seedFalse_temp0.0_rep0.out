{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The description mentions "prostate" with multiple sections from apex and basis, and comprehensive sampling with indexing, which is typical for radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.
2. Malignant finding: While there are some architectural variations mentioned, no clear malignancy is stated, and the description focuses on normal prostate tissue ("clear prostate tissue").
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is clearly stated and the text specifically mentions that Gleason classes could not be inferred, this is marked as "NA".
