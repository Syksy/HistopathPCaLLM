{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I arrived at this structured data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type: "RP" - The description mentions apex, basis, and prostate capsule, which is typical for radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.
2. Malignant finding: "no" - While there are some architectural variations mentioned, no clear malignancy is described, and the statement focuses on normal prostate tissue observations.
3. Gleason grade: "NA" - Since no malignancy is clearly stated and the text explicitly mentions that Gleason classes could not be inferred, this is marked as "NA".
