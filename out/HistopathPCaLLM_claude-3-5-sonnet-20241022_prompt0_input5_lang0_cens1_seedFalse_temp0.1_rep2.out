{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the comprehensive sampling description mentioning apex, basis, and multiple sections with different dyes, which is typical for RP specimens.
2. Malignant finding is "no" because no clear cancer diagnosis is mentioned, and the text focuses on normal prostate tissue observations.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because no specific Gleason grades are reported, and the text explicitly states that Gleason classes could not be inferred.
