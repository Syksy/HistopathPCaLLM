{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I determined these values because:
1. The mention of "shaving chips" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The description only mentions benign findings (benign prostate hyperplasia)
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
