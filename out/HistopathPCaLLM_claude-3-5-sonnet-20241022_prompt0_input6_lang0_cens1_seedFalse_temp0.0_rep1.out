{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is determined to be "TURP" based on the mention of "prostatic operation material" and fragmented nature, which is typical for transurethral resection specimens
- Malignant finding is "NA" because the statement indicates the results are inconclusive due to technical issues (burn artifact)
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no cancer was definitively identified and results were inconclusive
