Explanation: This is a biopsy case where there is only a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but no definitive malignant diagnosis ("suggesting adenocarcinoma" and "conclusions remain on the suspicion-level"). Therefore, this should be treated as a non-malignant finding without a Gleason grade. The sample type is clearly stated as prostate biopsies.
