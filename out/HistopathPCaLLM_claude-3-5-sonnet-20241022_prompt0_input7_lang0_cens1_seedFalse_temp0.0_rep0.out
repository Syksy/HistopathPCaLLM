{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text, we can determine that:
1. This appears to be a biopsy sample ("prostate sample material")
2. While there were some atypical findings, they were deemed inconclusive and too small to make definite conclusions, so this should be considered a non-malignant finding
3. Since no malignancy was confirmed, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
