{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" based on the mention of "prostate sample material"
- Malignant finding is "no" because although there were "atypical structures," they were described as too small to make definite conclusions, and the rest was typical
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignancy was confirmed, and therefore no Gleason grading was performed
