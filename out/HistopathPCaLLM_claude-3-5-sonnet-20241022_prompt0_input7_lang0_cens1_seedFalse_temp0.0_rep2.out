{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text:
1. Sample type is implied to be biopsy based on the mention of "prostate sample material"
2. While there were "atypical structures," the statement concludes that no definite conclusions could be drawn, and the changes were "diminishingly small," so this is effectively a negative finding
3. Since no malignancy was confirmed, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
