{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text, we can determine that:
1. This is a biopsy sample (based on the mention of "prostate sample material")
2. While there were some atypical findings, they were deemed inconclusive and too small to make any definite conclusions, so this is effectively a negative finding
3. Since no malignancy was confirmed, there is no Gleason grade to report (hence "NA")
