{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the text, we can determine that:
1. This is a biopsy sample (based on the mention of "prostate sample material")
2. While there were some atypical findings, they were deemed inconclusive and too small to make definite conclusions, so this should be considered a non-malignant finding
3. Since no malignancy was confirmed, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
