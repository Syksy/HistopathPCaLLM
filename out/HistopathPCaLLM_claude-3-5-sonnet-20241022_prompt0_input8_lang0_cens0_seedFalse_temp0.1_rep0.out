{
    "sample_type": "RP",
    "malignant_finding": "yes",
    "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}

I arrived at this structured data because:
1. The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" (sample 3), making this an RP specimen.
2. There are clear malignant findings described in the prostate tissue with invasive properties.
3. The Gleason grade is explicitly stated as 4+3=7, which is the highest (and thus most severe) grade mentioned in the text.
