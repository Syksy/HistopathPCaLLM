{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From the given text:
1. Sample type appears to be biopsy based on the description of multiple samples with indices.
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because while samples 1 and 2 are explicitly stated to be free of malignancy, sample 3's status is unclear with only mentions of "potentially interesting properties" and PIN-changes discussion.
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because the text explicitly states that the Gleason patterns are missing with "empty fields" and "no grade score is reported."
