{
    "sample_type": "biopsy",
    "malignant_finding": "NA",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I've structured the data based on the given text with the following reasoning:
1. Sample type is "biopsy" as multiple samples/segments are mentioned
2. Malignant finding is "NA" because while there are discussions of potential findings and Gleason patterns, no clear malignancy is confirmed. In fact, some samples are explicitly benign, and for the main sample (3), no definitive malignancy is stated
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because although Gleason patterns are mentioned, no specific grades are provided (described as empty fields with "?")
