{
    "sample_type": "TURP",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) based on the mention of "electrosection shavings"
- No malignant findings were explicitly stated ("No malignant findings are observed")
- Gleason grade is "NA" because this is a benign finding (benign hyperplasia)
