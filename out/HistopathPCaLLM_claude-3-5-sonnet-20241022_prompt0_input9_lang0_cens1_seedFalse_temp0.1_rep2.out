{
    "sample_type": "NA",
    "malignant_finding": "no",
    "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Explanation: From this statement:
- The sample type is not clearly specified, hence "NA"
- No malignant findings are mentioned (only normal epithelial cells and some processing artifacts are described), hence "no"
- Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grade is "NA"
