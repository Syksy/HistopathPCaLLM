{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. "Chipping samples" refers to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no... malignancies" and describes "benign prostate tissue"
3. Since there is no malignancy, there can't be a Gleason score, hence "NA"
