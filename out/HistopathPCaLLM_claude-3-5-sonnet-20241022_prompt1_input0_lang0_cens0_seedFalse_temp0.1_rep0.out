{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. "Chipping samples" refers to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no malignancies" and describes benign findings
3. Since there is no malignancy, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
