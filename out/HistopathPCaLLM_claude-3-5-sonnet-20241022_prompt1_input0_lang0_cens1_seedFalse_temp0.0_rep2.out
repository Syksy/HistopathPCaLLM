Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says that "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted," so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy determination and no mention of Gleason grades, "NA" is appropriate.
