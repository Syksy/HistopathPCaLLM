Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. The statement appears to be discussing technical aspects of sample processing and staining quality, but does not provide clear diagnostic information about malignancy or Gleason grades. The text mentions prostate tissue samples but doesn't specify the exact sampling method.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: The text primarily discusses technical aspects of sample processing and staining quality issues, without providing clear diagnostic information. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (Not Available) as there is insufficient information to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, or Gleason grade.
