Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. The statement appears to be discussing technical aspects of sample processing and staining quality, but does not provide clear diagnostic information about malignancy or Gleason grades. The sample type is not explicitly stated either.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: While the text mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material," it doesn't specify whether these are biopsies, RP, or TURP specimens. The statement focuses on technical aspects of sample processing and staining quality rather than providing diagnostic information about malignancy or Gleason grading.
