Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, this statement has several limitations:

1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned
2. While prostate tissue is discussed, malignancy is not clearly stated
3. While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are noted as being unable to be reliably assessed

Therefore, the most appropriate structured response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This conservative interpretation is chosen because:
- The sample type is not specified in the text
- While Gleason patterns are mentioned, they are explicitly stated as "could not be reliably assessed"
- There is no clear statement about malignancy presence or absence
