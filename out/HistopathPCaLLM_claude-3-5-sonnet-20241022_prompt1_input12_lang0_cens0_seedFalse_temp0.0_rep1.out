{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions the material is "benign"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding, and Gleason scoring is only applicable for malignant cases
