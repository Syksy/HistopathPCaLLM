{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which refers to transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions the material is "benign"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported
