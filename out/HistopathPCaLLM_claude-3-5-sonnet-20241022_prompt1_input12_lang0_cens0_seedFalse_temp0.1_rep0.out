{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I based this structured output on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the text mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate"
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says the material is "benign"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding (no cancer present, therefore no Gleason score applicable)
