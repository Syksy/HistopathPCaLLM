Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, the statement is quite ambiguous and lacks specific details about several key elements.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While the text mentions "sample" and "prostate," it doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, TURP, or RP specimen, hence "NA"
2. Malignancy: Although "prostate cancer tissue" is mentioned, the statement is ambiguous as it later states "appeared to at least originate from the prostate," making the malignancy status unclear, hence "NA"
3. Gleason: No Gleason score or grade information is provided in the statement, hence "NA"
