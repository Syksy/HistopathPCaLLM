Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While the text mentions "sample" and "prostate", it doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The text explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue", so "yes" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade information is provided in the text, so "NA" is appropriate.
