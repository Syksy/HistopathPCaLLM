Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP), so "NA" is appropriate
2. Malignancy is "yes" as the statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue"
3. Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so "NA" is appropriate
