Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate biopsy examination, but doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy or provide Gleason grades.

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (inferred from mention of multiple samples from different locations in the prostate)
- Malignancy: "NA" (while there are "suspicious" findings requiring consultation, no definitive malignancy is stated)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grades are mentioned in the text)
