Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text describes "tumorous growth" and "carcinoma," so this is clearly malignant.
3. Gleason: The text mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%." Since the larger portion (60%) is pattern 3, this indicates a 3+4=7 Gleason score (where pattern 3 is predominant).
