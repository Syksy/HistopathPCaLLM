Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. The statement is quite ambiguous and doesn't clearly state the sample type, confirm malignancy, or provide a definitive Gleason score. While there is a mention of a comparison to a "Gleason 7" patient, this is not a direct finding for this case.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While there is mention of tissue processing, it's not clearly stated if this is from RP, TURP, or biopsy.
2. Malignancy: While there are mentions of "special patterns of cell growth," there is no definitive statement about malignancy.
3. Gleason: While there is a reference to another patient with Gleason 7, no specific Gleason grade is assigned to this case.
