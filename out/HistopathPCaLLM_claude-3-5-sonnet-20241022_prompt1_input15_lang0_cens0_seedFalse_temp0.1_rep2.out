{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" as the text mentions "prostate chippings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is explicitly mentioned
3. Gleason score is reported as "4+4=8" since the text mentions Gleason 4 being predominant and the sum being 8, which implies both primary and secondary patterns are 4
