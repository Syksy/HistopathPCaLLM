Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is inconclusive and doesn't provide definitive findings:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified in the text
2. Malignancy is not confirmed (only mentioned as a clinical suspicion)
3. Gleason score is not determined (only mentioned as a clinical suspicion of "8 or above" but explicitly stated as not being based on histopathology)
