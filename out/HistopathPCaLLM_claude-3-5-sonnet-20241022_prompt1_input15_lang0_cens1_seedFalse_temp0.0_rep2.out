Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is inconclusive and doesn't provide definitive findings:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified in the text
2. Malignancy is not confirmed (only mentioned as a clinical suspicion)
3. Gleason score is only mentioned as a clinical suspicion but not confirmed through histopathology

The text mentions clinical suspicions but explicitly states that findings need to be revised and that Gleason "could not be determined at this time." Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" since no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this statement.
