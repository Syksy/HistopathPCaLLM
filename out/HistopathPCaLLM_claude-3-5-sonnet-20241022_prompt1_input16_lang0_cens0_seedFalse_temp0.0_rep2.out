Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly fusion biopsies, so "biopsy"
2. Malignancy is present as carcinoma is described, so "yes"
3. For Gleason grade, the statement indicates:
   - Mainly grade 3 (approximately 2/3 of the tumor)
   - Some grade 4 (less than 1/3 of the tumor)
   - Total score of 7 is mentioned
   Therefore, as grade 3 is predominant and grade 4 is secondary, the Gleason score is structured as "3+4=7"
