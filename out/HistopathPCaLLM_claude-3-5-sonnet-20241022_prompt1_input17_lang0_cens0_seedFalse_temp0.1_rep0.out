I'll analyze this prostate cancer pathology statement and structure it according to the requested format.

From the text:
1. This is a prostatectomy (RP) specimen
2. There are clear malignant findings
3. The dominant pattern is Gleason grade 4 with secondary pattern 3

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Note: While the text doesn't explicitly state "4+3=7", we can determine this from the description stating that grade 4 is "most dominant" with "some grade 3", which by convention would be reported as 4+3=7.
