Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "Prostatectomy preparate" in the text.
2. Malignancy is "yes" as multiple tumor foci are described.
3. Gleason grade is reported as "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which indicates a 4+3 pattern (where the first number represents the most prevalent grade). Therefore, the Gleason score is structured as "4+3=7".
