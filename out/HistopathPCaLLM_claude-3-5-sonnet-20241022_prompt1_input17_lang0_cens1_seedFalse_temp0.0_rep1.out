Based on the provided text, I'll structure the available information according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: The text mentions multiple prostate tissue samples labeled A-O, which indicates this is a systematic biopsy sampling.
- Malignancy: The text doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found or not. It appears to be a preliminary report awaiting further assessment.
- Gleason: While the text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 as possible values to assess, no actual Gleason score is reported for any specific finding.
