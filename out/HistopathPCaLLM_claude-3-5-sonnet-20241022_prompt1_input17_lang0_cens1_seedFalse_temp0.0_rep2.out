Based on the provided text, I'll structure the available information according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: The text mentions multiple prostate tissue samples labeled A-O, which indicates this is a systematic biopsy sampling.
- Malignancy: The text doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found or not. It appears to be a preliminary report awaiting further assessment.
- Gleason: While Gleason grades 3-5 are mentioned, they are referenced only as potential findings to be assessed later, not as actual findings. Therefore, no specific Gleason score is reported.
