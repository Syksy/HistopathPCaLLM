Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. The mention of "chippings" and "shaving procedure" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) sample.
2. Malignancy is present as indicated by "carcinoma" being detected.
3. For the Gleason grade, the statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" with "stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Since grade 3 is the predominant pattern (60%), and the sum is 7, this means the Gleason score must be 3+4=7.
