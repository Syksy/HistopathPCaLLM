Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't explicitly state the sample type or provide a definitive Gleason grade, I'll make conservative assessments:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (only mentions "standard prostate related procedures"), so it's marked as "NA"
2. While there is a suspicious focus, it's described as too small to grade and >95% is benign. Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, this is best classified as "no"
3. No Gleason grade is definitively assigned (only mentions possibility of ISUP GG 1 or above, but explicitly states it cannot be properly graded), so it's marked as "NA"
