Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't explicitly state the sample type or provide definitive Gleason grades, I'll make conservative assessments:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type isn't explicitly stated (only mentions "standard prostate related procedures"), so it's marked as "NA"
2. While there is a suspicious focus, it's not definitively diagnosed as malignant (only mentioned as "might contain" and "suspicious"), and >95% is described as benign. Therefore, without a definitive malignant diagnosis, this is marked as "no"
3. Since no definitive malignancy is diagnosed and no specific Gleason grades are provided (only a mention of possible ISUP GG 1 or above), this is marked as "NA"
