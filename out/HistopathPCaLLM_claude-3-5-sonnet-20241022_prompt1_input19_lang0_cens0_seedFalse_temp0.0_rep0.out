{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the most severe finding in the statement. The reasoning is:
1. The text clearly mentions "targeted prostate biopsies" as sample type
2. Malignancy is present as adenocarcinoma is found in sample 4
3. For Gleason grade, the text describes Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Following standard reporting practice, the primary (most prevalent) pattern is Gleason 3 and the secondary pattern is Gleason 4, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
