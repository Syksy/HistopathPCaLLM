{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the most severe finding in the statement. The reasoning is:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "targeted prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as adenocarcinoma was found in sample 4
3. For Gleason grade, sample 4 shows Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Following standard reporting practice, this would be structured as Gleason 3+4=7, where the most prevalent pattern is listed first, followed by the secondary pattern.
