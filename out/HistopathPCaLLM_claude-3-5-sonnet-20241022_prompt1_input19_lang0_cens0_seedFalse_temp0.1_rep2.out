{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the most severe finding in the statement. The reasoning is:
1. The text clearly indicates these are prostate biopsies
2. Malignancy is present (adenocarcinoma in sample 4)
3. For Gleason grade, the text mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Following standard reporting practice, the primary pattern is the most prevalent (Gleason 3) and the secondary is the lesser (Gleason 4), resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
