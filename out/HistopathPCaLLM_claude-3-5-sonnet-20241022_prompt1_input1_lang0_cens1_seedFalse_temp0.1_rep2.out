Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is inconclusive and doesn't provide clear information about malignancy or Gleason grades, and while it mentions "prostate cancer samples" it doesn't explicitly state the sample type, I'll mark uncertain values as "NA".

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This structured response reflects that:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated in the text
2. Malignancy findings are explicitly stated as inconclusive
3. No Gleason grades are reported, and the statement indicates that Gleason findings require additional inspection
