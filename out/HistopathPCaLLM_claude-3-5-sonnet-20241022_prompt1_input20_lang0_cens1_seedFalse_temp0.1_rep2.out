Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since the statement indicates that examination of adenocarcinoma is impossible due to prior therapies, and no definitive findings are reported, I'll structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (derived from mention of "prostate tissue samples")
- Malignancy: "NA" (examination is stated to be impossible due to therapy effects)
- Gleason: "NA" (no definitive Gleason score is given; the mentioned "3+4" is only a hypothetical example)
