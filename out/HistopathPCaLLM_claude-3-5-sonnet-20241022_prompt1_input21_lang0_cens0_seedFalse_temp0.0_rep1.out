{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I determined this structure based on the following analysis:
1. The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The description of poorly differentiated growth, abnormal nuclei, and explicit mention of tumor-like tissue clearly indicates malignancy
3. The Gleason grades are explicitly mentioned with 5 being most common and 4 being second most common, which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9
