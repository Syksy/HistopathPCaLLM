{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I based this structured extraction on the following analysis:
1. "Prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The description of "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue" clearly indicates malignancy
3. The Gleason grading is explicitly mentioned with "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9
