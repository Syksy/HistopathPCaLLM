Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be about a tissue sample, but due to quality issues, definitive assessment cannot be made.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement suggests this is from a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- Malignancy: "NA" - Due to poor quality of the specimen ("nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise"), no definitive assessment of malignancy can be made
- Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason grading is possible or mentioned due to the quality issues
