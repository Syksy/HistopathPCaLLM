Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be about a tissue sample with quality control issues, but lacks clear diagnostic conclusions.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement suggests this is from a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).
2. Malignancy: "NA" - Due to quality issues and dissolved nuclei, no definitive assessment of malignancy is provided.
3. Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned, and due to quality issues, grading would not be possible.
