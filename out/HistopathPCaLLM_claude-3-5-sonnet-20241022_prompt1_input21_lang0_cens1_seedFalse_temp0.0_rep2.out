Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a tissue sample with quality control issues, but lacks clear diagnostic conclusions.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement suggests this is from a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- Malignancy: "NA" - Due to quality issues and dissolved nuclei, no definitive assessment of malignancy is provided
- Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned, and the quality issues prevent proper assessment of cellular patterns
