Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a tissue sample that has quality control issues, but doesn't clearly specify the sample type (though it's likely TURP based on the fragmented nature and weight), doesn't definitively state malignancy status, and doesn't provide Gleason grading due to poor sample quality.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: I've interpreted this as a TURP specimen based on the description of "several fragments" with weight measurement, which is typical for TURP specimens. However, the malignancy status and Gleason grade are marked as "NA" because the statement indicates that the tissue quality is too poor for proper assessment, with dissolved nuclei and technical noise preventing proper evaluation of cell differentiation patterns.
