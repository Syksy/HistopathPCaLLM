Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be about a tissue sample, but due to quality issues, definitive assessment cannot be made.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "TURP" (based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement, which is typical for TURP specimens)
- Malignancy: "NA" (cannot be determined due to poor specimen quality and pending QC)
- Gleason: "NA" (cannot be determined due to poor specimen quality and pending QC)

The statement primarily discusses quality control issues with the specimen and indicates that proper assessment cannot be made until after additional quality control measures are taken.
