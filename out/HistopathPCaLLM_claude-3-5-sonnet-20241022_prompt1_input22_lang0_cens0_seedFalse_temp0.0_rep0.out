{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a biopsy ("prostate thick needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is present ("carcinoma tissue structures" on the left side)
3. For Gleason grade, the statement mentions "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which indicates a Gleason pattern of 3+4=7. Since we should report the most severe finding, and this is the only malignant finding described, this is the grade to report.
