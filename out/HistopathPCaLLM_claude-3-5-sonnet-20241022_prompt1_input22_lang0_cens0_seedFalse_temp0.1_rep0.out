{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a biopsy ("prostate thick needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is present ("carcinoma tissue structures" on the left side)
3. For Gleason grade, the statement mentions "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4" on the left side, which translates to a 3+4 pattern. Since this is the most severe finding in the statement, it's reported as "3+4=7"
