{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a biopsy ("prostate thick needle biopsies")
2. Malignancy is present ("carcinoma tissue structures" on left side)
3. For Gleason grade, the statement mentions Gleason scores 3 and 4, with score 4 being mentioned secondly, suggesting a 4+3 pattern. Since this is the most severe finding in the statement, it should be reported as "4+3=7"
