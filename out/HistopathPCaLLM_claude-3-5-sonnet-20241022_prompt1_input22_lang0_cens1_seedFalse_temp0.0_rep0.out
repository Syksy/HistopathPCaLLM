Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (evident from the description of prostate tissue sampling material with specific fragment lengths)
- Malignancy: "NA" (the statement explicitly mentions that malignancy cannot be assessed due to sample quality issues)
- Gleason: "NA" (the statement indicates that Gleason grading cannot be performed due to sample quality issues)
