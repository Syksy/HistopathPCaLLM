Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with specific fragment lengths, which indicates this is a biopsy specimen.
- Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that "samples cannot be assessed for malignancies," so this is marked as "NA" (not assessable).
- Gleason: Since malignancy couldn't be assessed and the text mentions difficulty in assigning Gleason grades, this is marked as "NA".
