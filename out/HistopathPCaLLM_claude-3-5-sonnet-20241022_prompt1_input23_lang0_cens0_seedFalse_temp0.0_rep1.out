{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is clearly stated
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the two most prevalent patterns mentioned (grade 4 at 60% and grade 5 at 30%, with grade 3 being only tertiary and thus not included in the primary score)
