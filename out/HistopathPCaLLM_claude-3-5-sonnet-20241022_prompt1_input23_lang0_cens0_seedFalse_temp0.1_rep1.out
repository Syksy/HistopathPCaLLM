{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is clearly stated
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on:
   - Grade 4 is the most common (60%)
   - Grade 5 is the second most common (30%)
   - Grade 3 is only tertiary and minimal
   - The conclusion explicitly states "Gleason-score sum 9"
   - According to grading rules, the two most prevalent grades form the score
