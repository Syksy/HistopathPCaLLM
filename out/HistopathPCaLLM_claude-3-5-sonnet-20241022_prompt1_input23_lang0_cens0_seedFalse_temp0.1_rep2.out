{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma is clearly stated
3. Gleason grade is "4+5=9" based on the most prevalent patterns (Grade 4 at 60% and Grade 5 at 30% being the two most common components, with Grade 3 being only tertiary and thus not included in the primary score)
