{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I've structured the data based on the given text where:
1. Sample type is clearly TURP (turp-chippings)
2. Malignancy is present (adenocarcinoma confirmed)
3. Gleason score is mentioned as sum 8, and with Gleason 4 pattern being predominant, this indicates a 4+4=8 score
