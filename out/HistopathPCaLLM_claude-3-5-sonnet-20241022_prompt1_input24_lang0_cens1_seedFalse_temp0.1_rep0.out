Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since this is a mixed collection of samples with varying findings, I'll focus on the most severe finding mentioned:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: Although both biopsies and radical prostatectomies are mentioned, the text describes a mixed collection without specifying which type corresponds to the most severe finding, hence "NA"
2. Malignancy: "yes" because malignant findings were detected in some cases (upgraded from benign to Gleason scores)
3. Gleason: "3+4=7" as this was mentioned as the highest grade found ("at most 3+4")
