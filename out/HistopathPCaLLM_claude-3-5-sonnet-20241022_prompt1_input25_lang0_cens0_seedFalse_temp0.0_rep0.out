I'll analyze this prostate biopsy statement and structure the data according to the requirements. Since we need to report the most severe findings, I'll evaluate the Gleason patterns across all samples.

From samples (1) and (2), we have adenocarcinoma present, with Gleason patterns 3 and 4 mentioned. Looking at the percentages, both samples show a combination of patterns 3 and 4, with pattern 3 being more prevalent in both cases (30% vs 20% in sample 1, and 35% vs 15% in sample 2). Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
