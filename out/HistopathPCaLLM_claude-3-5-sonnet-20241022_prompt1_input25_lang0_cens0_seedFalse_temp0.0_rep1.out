I'll analyze this prostate biopsy statement and structure the data according to the requirements. Since we need to report the most severe findings, I'll evaluate the Gleason patterns across all samples.

From samples (1) and (2), we have adenocarcinoma present, with Gleason patterns 3 and 4 mentioned. Looking at the percentages, both samples show a combination of patterns 3 and 4, with pattern 3 being more prevalent in both cases (30% vs 20% in sample 1, and 35% vs 15% in sample 2), making this a 3+4 Gleason score.

Here's the structured response:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

The reasoning:
- Sample type is clearly a biopsy (multiple cores described)
- Malignancy is present ("presence of prostate adenocarcinoma")
- Gleason score is structured as 3+4=7 (pattern 3 being predominant with pattern 4 as secondary)
