Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The description refers to multiple samples with measurements and tissue descriptions, which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement explicitly concludes that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified."
3. Gleason: "NA" - No definitive Gleason grading is provided, and since malignancy couldn't be verified, Gleason grading is not applicable.
