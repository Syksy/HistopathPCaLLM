Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumor is clearly described ("reveals a widely spread tumor")
3. Gleason grade is derived from the statement "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent", which indicates a 3+4 pattern. Since this is the only Gleason information provided and it describes the largest tumor focus, it represents the most severe lesion.
