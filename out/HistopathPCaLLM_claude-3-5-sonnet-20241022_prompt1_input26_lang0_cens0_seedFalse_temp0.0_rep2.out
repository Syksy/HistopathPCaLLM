Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text clearly describes a tumor ("widely spread tumor"), so malignancy is present.
3. Gleason: The text mentions "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." Since Gleason 3 is described as dominant and 4 as secondary, this translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
