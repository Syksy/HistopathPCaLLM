Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the text is ambiguous and complicated by radiation therapy effects, I'll use conservative interpretations:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy or RP, but not explicitly stated)
2. Malignancy status is not definitively stated
3. While Gleason 7 is mentioned, it's noted as uncertain ("possible") and from clinical notes rather than confirmed by current histopathological examination. Due to RT effects, no definitive grading is possible.
