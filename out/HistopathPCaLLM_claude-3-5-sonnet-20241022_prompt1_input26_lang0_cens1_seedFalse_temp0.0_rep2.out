Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: While not explicitly stated as a biopsy, the description of multiple samples from apex and basis (A-F) suggests this is a biopsy specimen.
- Malignancy: Set as "NA" because while there's a mention of a possible previous Gleason score, the current specimen cannot be properly assessed due to radiation therapy changes.
- Gleason: Set as "NA" because although there's a mention of a possible "Gleason sum 7", this is noted as historical information and cannot be verified in the current specimen due to radiation therapy changes.
