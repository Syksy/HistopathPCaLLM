Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is somewhat ambiguous, I'll make the following interpretations:

1. Sample type is not clearly specified (no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. The findings are inconclusive regarding definitive malignancy
3. While Gleason 3 is mentioned, it's described as debatable and not presented in the standard format of major+minor=sum

Therefore, I'll structure the response as:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This conservative interpretation reflects the ambiguity in the source text and avoids making assumptions about unclear findings.
