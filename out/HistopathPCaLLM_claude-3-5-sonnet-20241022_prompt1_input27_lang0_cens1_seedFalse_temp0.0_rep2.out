Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Given the ambiguous nature of the statement, here's my interpretation:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is unclear from the statement (just mentions "prostate tissue" without specifying if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP), hence "NA"
2. While there's mention of "growth patterns" and a tentative Gleason 3, the statement is highly uncertain ("debatably", "maybe") and indicates the patterns don't follow normal prostate tumor differentiation. Therefore, this doesn't constitute a clear malignant finding, hence "no"
3. Since there's no clear malignant finding and no definitive Gleason scoring, Gleason is marked as "NA"
