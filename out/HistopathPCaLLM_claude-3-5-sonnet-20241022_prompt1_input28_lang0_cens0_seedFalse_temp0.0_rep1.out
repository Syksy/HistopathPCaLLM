{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text clearly states these are "biopsy cylinders"
2. Malignancy is present as multiple foci of adenocarcinoma are described
3. For Gleason grade, I selected the most severe finding (4+4=8 from focus #1) as per instructions, even though other foci had different grades (4+3=7 and 3+4=7)
