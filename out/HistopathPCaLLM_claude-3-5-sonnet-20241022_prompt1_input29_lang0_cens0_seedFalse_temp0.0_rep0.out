{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I determined this structure based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" because it describes a fresh prostate specimen with weight and systematic sampling from different planes/lobes, which is typical for radical prostatectomy specimens.
2. Malignancy is "yes" because invasive adenocarcinoma is explicitly mentioned.
3. Gleason score is reported as sum 7, and from the description of "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern... with the smaller portion as grade 4", this appears to be a 4+3=7 pattern (although there might be a typo in the original text where it states "smaller portion as grade 4" twice).
