Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: This appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen based on the description of a complete prostate with weight and systematic sampling from different planes.
2. Malignancy: "yes" as invasive adenocarcinoma is clearly stated.
3. Gleason: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" as predominant and "grade 4" as secondary pattern, with a stated "Score sum 7". While there appears to be a typo in the original text (mentioning grade 4 twice), given that the sum is 7 and the predominant pattern is 4, this can be interpreted as 4+3=7.
