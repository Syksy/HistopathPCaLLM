Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as a "prostatectomy specimen" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. The statement describes only benign findings ("normal benign growth", "atrophy", "inflammation", "hyperplasia") with no mention of malignancy, hence "no"
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, there can't be a Gleason score, therefore "NA"
