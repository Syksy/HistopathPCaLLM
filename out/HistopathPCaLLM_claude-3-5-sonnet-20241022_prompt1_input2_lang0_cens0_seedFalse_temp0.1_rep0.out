Based on the provided prostate histopathology statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "no",
    "Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is indicated by "prostatectomy specimen"
2. Malignancy: "no" as the statement describes only benign findings ("normal benign growth", no mention of cancer/malignancy)
3. Gleason: "NA" as this is a benign case with no malignancy reported
