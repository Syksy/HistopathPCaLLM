Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since this is an autopsy specimen with inconclusive findings regarding malignancy, and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While it's mentioned as an "autopsy specimen," this doesn't fit into the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The findings are inconclusive ("cannot be reliable inferred"), so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text, so "NA" is appropriate.
