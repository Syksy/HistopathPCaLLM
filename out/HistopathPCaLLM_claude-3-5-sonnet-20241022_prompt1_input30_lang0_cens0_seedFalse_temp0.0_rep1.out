Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "chippings" and "urothelial cells" suggests this is from a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy: The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy.
3. Gleason: The statement indicates a primary pattern of grade 4 and secondary pattern of grade 3. Although there is mention of tertiary pattern 5, according to standard reporting guidelines, only the two most prevalent patterns are used for the final Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason score is structured as "4+3=7".
