Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "chippings" near urothelial cells suggests this is from a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy: The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy as "yes".
3. Gleason: The statement indicates a primary pattern of grade 4 and secondary pattern of grade 3 (with tertiary pattern 5). According to standard reporting guidelines, the most severe Gleason score should be reported as 4+3=7.
