Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement describes an inconclusive consultation without clear mention of sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade, I'll mark all fields as "NA":

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is appropriate because:
1. The sample type is not mentioned in the text
2. The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain ("could not confirm or deny")
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned or applicable due to the inconclusive nature of the findings
