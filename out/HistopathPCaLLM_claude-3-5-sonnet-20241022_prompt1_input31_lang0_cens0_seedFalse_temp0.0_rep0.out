Based on the provided statement, I will focus on the most severe lesion mentioned and structure the data accordingly:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is clearly a biopsy (both systematic and targeted biopsies mentioned)
- Malignancy is present
- While there are two different Gleason scores mentioned (3+3=6 from earlier biopsy and 4+5=9 from the targeted biopsy), I've reported the most severe finding (4+5=9) as per instructions
