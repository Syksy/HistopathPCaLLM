Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since multiple Gleason patterns are mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), I'll report the most severe pattern which is 4+4=8.

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly "RP" (radical prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy is "yes" as multifocal adenocarcinoma is mentioned
3. Gleason score: Among the mentioned patterns (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), the most severe is 4+4=8
