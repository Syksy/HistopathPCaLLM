Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, this statement doesn't clearly specify many of the requested parameters.

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" - The mention of "original primary prostate tissue" and examination of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement doesn't explicitly mention whether malignant tumor was found or not.
3. Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason score is mentioned in the statement.
