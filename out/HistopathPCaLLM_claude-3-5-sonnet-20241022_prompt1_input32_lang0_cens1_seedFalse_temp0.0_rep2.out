Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, the text provided doesn't explicitly state many of the required details.

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is inferred from the mention of "original primary prostate tissue" and reference to "seminal vesicles"
- Malignancy: "NA" because while there are samples mentioned, there's no clear statement about malignant findings
- Gleason: "NA" because no Gleason scores are mentioned in the text

Note: The statement primarily discusses specimen characteristics and mentions negative findings in lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, but lacks specific information about tumor presence or Gleason grading.
