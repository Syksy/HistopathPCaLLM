{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Note: I selected "4+3=7" as the Gleason grade because when multiple grades are mentioned (3+4/4+3), we should report the most severe finding, which in this case is 4+3=7. The sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP), and there are malignant findings present.
