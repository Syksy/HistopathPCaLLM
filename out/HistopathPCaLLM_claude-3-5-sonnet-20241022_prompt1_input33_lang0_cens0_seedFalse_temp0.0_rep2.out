{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Note: I selected "4+3=7" as the Gleason grade because when multiple grades are mentioned, we should report the most severe finding, and 4+3 is more severe than 3+4. The sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP), and malignancy is present as evidenced by the tumor description and Gleason grading.
