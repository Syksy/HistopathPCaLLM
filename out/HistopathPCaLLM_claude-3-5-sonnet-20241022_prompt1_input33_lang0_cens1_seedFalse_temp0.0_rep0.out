Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, the statement is quite vague and doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, clear malignancy status, or any Gleason grades.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
- Sample type is not clearly specified in the text
- While lymph nodes are mentioned as "possibly abnormal" and seminal vesicles are noted as non-malignant, there's no clear overall malignancy status for the primary prostatic tissue
- No Gleason grade information is provided in the text
