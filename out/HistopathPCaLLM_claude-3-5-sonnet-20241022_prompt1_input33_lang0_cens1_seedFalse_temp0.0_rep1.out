Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement is quite vague and doesn't provide clear information about sample type, explicit malignancy confirmation, or Gleason grades.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified in the text
2. While lymph nodes are mentioned as "possibly abnormal" and seminal vesicles are noted as non-malignant, there's no clear statement about prostate malignancy
3. No Gleason grade information is provided in the text
