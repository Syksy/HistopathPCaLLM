Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. However, the given text does not explicitly state the sample type, confirm malignancy, or provide Gleason grades. Therefore, I'll use "NA" for all fields where specific information is not provided.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: The statement contains general processing information and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, but lacks the specific information required for the structured fields. Without explicit information about the sample type, clear malignancy status in the prostate tissue, or Gleason grading, we must use "NA" as the default value.
