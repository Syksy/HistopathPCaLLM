Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. The sample is described as a "resection" with weight measurement, which is typical for TURP specimens
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no malignities" and "findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
