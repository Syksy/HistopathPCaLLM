Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The text mentions "resection" and weight, which is characteristic of TURP specimens
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "no malignities" and "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
