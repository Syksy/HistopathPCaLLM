Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified in the text (could be TURP or RP based on weight, but since it's not explicit, marking as "NA")
2. The statement indicates benign findings (hyperplastic tissue with inflammation) and explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer]", so malignancy is "no"
3. Since this is a benign finding, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
