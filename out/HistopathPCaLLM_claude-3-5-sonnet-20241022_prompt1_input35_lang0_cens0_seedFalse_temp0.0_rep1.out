Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma"
3. Gleason score is "NA" since there is no malignancy (only PIN changes and hyperplasia are mentioned, which are not malignant findings)
