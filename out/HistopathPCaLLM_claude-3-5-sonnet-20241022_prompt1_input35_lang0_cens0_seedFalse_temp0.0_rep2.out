{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma" and only mentions benign findings (PIN changes and hyperplasia)
3. Gleason score is "NA" because there is no malignancy present, and therefore no Gleason grading is applicable
