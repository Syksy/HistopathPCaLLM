Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While not explicitly stated, the mention of "left and right lobe" samples suggests these are prostate biopsies.
2. Malignancy: "no" - The findings describe PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) and hyperplasia, which are not malignant conditions.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since no cancer is present, no Gleason score is applicable.
