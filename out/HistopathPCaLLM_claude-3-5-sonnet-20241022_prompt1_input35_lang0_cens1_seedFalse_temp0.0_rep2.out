Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While not explicitly stated, the mention of "left and right lobe" samples suggests these are prostate biopsies.
2. Malignancy: The findings described (PIN changes and hyperplasia) are not malignant. High-grade PIN is a precursor lesion but not cancer.
3. Gleason: Since no cancer is present, Gleason score is "NA".
