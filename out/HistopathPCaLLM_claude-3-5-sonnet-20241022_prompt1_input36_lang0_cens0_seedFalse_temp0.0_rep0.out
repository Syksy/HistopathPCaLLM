Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Given the weight and size of the specimen and the mention of nodular hyperplasia, this appears to be a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity," so this is clearly negative.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA" (Not Applicable).
