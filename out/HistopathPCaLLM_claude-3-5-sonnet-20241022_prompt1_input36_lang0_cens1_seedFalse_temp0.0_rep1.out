Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text, hence "NA"
2. No malignant findings are mentioned, only hyperplasia which is benign, hence "no"
3. Since no malignancy is present, Gleason score is "NA"
