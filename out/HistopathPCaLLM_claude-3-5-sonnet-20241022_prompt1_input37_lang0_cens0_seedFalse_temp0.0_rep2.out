Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the text mentions "electrosection chippings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
2. Malignancy is "no" because the findings only show hyperplasia and inflammation, with no mention of cancer or malignancy
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding (no cancer present)
