Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, doesn't confirm malignancy, and doesn't mention any Gleason grades, I'll use "NA" for the undefined values.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: The statement only describes general prostate tissue findings with nodular gland components and inflammation, but doesn't provide enough information to determine the sample type, confirm or rule out malignancy, or provide Gleason grading.
