Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, doesn't confirm malignancy, and doesn't mention any Gleason grades, I'll use "NA" for uncertain or missing values.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: The statement describes prostate tissue with nodular components and inflammation, but doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP) or provide any conclusive information about malignancy. Since further examination is pending, all fields are marked as "NA" due to incomplete information.
