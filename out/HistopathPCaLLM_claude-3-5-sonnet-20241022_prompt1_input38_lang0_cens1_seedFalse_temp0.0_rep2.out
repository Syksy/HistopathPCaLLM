Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified in the text, hence "NA"
2. No malignant findings are mentioned, only hyperplastic tissue with inflammation, hence "no"
3. Since no malignancy is present, Gleason score is "NA"
