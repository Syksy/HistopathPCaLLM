{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumor is clearly described with multiple foci
3. Gleason is "3+4=7" because the text mentions Gleason 3 as major and 4 as secondary pattern, resulting in sum of 7
