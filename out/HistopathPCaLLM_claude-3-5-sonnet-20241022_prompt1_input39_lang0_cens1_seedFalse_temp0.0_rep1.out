Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is unclear about several aspects, including the sample type and malignancy status, and explicitly states that Gleason score cannot be assessed, I'll use "NA" where appropriate.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is not specified in the text, hence "NA"
- Malignancy is explicitly stated as uncertain ("not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings"), hence "NA"
- Gleason score is explicitly stated as unable to be assessed, hence "NA"
