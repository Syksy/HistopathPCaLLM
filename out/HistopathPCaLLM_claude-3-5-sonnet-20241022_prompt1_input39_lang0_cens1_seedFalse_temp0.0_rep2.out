Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is unclear about several aspects, I'll use "NA" where appropriate.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text
2. Malignancy is explicitly stated as uncertain ("not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings")
3. Gleason score is explicitly stated as not assessable ("cannot be assessed at this point")
