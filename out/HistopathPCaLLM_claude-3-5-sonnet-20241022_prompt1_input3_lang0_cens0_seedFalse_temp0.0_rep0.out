Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is explicitly stated as not present ("Nothing indicating malignancy is found")
3. Gleason score is NA as this is a benign finding
