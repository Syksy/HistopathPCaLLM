Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found", so this is a benign finding
3. Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, the Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
