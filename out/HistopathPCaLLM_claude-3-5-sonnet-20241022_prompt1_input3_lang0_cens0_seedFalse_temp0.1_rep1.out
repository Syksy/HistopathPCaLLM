Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (prostate chippings is indicative of TURP procedure)
2. Malignancy is explicitly stated as not found ("Nothing indicating malignancy is found")
3. Gleason score is NA because this is a benign finding (no malignancy)
