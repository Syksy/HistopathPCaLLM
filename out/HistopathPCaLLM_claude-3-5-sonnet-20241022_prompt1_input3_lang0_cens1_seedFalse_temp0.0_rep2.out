Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: The description mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" in a "single run," which is typical for TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimens
- Malignancy: Due to burn artifacts and inconclusive examination, this cannot be determined, hence "NA"
- Gleason: Since malignancy cannot be determined and the examination was inconclusive, this is "NA"
