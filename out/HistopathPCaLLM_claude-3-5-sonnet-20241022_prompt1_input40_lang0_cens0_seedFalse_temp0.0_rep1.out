Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "shaving material"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia"
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign finding with no cancer present
