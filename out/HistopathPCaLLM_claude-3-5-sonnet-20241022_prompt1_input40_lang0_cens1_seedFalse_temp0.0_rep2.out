Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is somewhat ambiguous and lacks specific details, I'll use "NA" where information is not clearly stated.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the text (could be TURP or RP based on weight, but it's not definitively stated)
2. No clear malignancy is mentioned (only hyperplasia and inflammation are noted)
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since there's no clear malignancy, it's marked as "NA"
