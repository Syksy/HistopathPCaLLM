Based on the provided prostate histopathology statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "systematic biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign case with no cancer present
