Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly from prostate sampling (multiple samples from left and right lobes), indicating this is a biopsy procedure
2. Malignancy is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions uncertainty about cancer ("Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not")
3. Gleason score is "NA" as no cancer is definitively diagnosed and thus no Gleason grading is provided
