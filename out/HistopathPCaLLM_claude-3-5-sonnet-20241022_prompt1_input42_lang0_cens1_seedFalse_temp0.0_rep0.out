Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified (just mentions "prostate sample")
2. Malignancy is explicitly uncertain ("cannot be determined")
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since malignancy is uncertain, Gleason is NA
