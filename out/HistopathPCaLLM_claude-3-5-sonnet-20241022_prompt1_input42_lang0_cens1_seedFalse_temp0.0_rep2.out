{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Explanation: The statement describes a prostate sample but doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP). The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain ("cannot be determined"), and consequently, there is no Gleason grade information. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA".
