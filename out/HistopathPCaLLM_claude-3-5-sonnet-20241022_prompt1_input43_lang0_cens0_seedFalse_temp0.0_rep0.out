{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma" indicating this is a benign finding
3. Since there is no malignancy, there can't be a Gleason grade, hence "NA"
