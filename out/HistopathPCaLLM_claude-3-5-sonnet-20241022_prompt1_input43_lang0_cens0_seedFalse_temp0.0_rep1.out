Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign finding
