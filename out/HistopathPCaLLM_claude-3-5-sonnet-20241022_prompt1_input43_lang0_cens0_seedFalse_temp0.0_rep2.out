{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma" indicating benign findings
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
