Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "30g prostate samples" suggests this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: Since "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" is stated, this should be marked as "NA" (not able to determine).
3. Gleason: Since no cancer is definitively diagnosed, and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this should be "NA".
