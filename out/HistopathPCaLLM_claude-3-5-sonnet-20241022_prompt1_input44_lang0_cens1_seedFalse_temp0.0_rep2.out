Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While it mentions "prostate samples," it doesn't specifically state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" and while it mentions previous cancer, the current sample shows no malignancy, so "no" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is reported in the current sample, "NA" is appropriate.
