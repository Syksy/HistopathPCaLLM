{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "whole prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as there is clear description of tumor tissue
3. Gleason grade is reported as "classes 3+4", which translates to "3+4=7"
