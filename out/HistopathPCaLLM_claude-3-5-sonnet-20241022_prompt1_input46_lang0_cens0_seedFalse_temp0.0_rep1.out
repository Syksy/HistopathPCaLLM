{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because "shaved prostate chippings" refers to transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding without any cancer
