{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. "Shaved prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" clearly indicates no malignancy
3. Since there is no malignancy, Gleason score is not applicable (NA)
