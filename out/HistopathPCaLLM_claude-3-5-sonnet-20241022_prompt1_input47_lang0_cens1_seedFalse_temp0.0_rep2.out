Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While not explicitly stated as "biopsy," the description of examining material from right and left with measurements suggests this is a biopsy specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions they are "not able to determine whether there is malign findings," so this is marked as "NA"
3. Gleason: Since there is no confirmed malignancy, and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this is marked as "NA"
