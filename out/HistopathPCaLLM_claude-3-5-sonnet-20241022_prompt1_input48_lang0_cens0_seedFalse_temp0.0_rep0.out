Explanation: This is a prostate resection (RP) specimen with malignant findings (adenocarcinoma). While multiple tumor foci are described, we should report the highest (most severe) Gleason score. The second focus with Gleason 5 (>80%) and Gleason 4 represents the most severe finding, corresponding to a 5+4=9 Gleason score, which is also confirmed in the summary statement.
