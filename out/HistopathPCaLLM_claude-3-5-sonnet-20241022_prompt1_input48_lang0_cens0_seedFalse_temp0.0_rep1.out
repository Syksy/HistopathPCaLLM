{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I've structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostate resection"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma was found
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9", taking the most severe lesion mentioned (second focus with Gleason 5 >80% and some Gleason 4, confirmed by summary stating "Gleason 9 tumor")
