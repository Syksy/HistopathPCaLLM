Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since this appears to be an educational/demonstration case using autopsy material where no specific Gleason grading was performed, and no clear malignancy statement is made:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While prostate tissue is mentioned, this is an educational demonstration using autopsy material, not a standard biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is most appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The text doesn't clearly state whether malignant findings were present, only mentioning "interesting patterns" and "histological changes", so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: The text explicitly states that differentiation scores (Gleason) were not derived, so "NA" is appropriate.
