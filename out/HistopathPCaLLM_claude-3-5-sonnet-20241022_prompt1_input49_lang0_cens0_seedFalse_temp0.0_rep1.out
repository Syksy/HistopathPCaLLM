{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. The mention of "chippings" and "shavings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The text clearly states carcinoma was found in 5 shavings, indicating malignancy is present
3. The Gleason grading is described with "most common" being 3 and "second most common" being 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
