{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. The mention of "chippings" and "shavings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The text clearly states carcinoma was found, indicating malignancy
3. For Gleason grade, the statement mentions "most common is 3" and "second most common is 4", which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7 following standard reporting conventions
