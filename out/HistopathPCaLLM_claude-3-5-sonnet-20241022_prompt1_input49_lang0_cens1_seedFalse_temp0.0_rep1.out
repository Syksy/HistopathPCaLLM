Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (can be inferred from the mention of multiple samples on glasses, which is typical for biopsy specimens)
- Malignancy: "NA" (while changes warranting investigation are mentioned, no definitive malignant findings are reported)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grading is mentioned, and since malignancy is not confirmed, Gleason grading would not be applicable)
