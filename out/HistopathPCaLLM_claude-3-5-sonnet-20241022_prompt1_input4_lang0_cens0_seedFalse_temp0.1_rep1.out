Based on the provided prostate histopathology statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies"
2. The statement explicitly indicates benign findings and absence of adenocarcinoma ("benign prostate tissue" and "do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma")
3. Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
