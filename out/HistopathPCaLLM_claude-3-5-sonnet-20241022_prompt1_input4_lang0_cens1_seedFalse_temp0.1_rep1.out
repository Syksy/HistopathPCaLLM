Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The mention of "several sampling sites" and "sample parts" suggests this is from a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: Since the statement indicates that the material is "insufficient to reliably assess" for adenocarcinoma, this should be marked as "NA" (not assessable).
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy assessment possible, and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this is "NA".
