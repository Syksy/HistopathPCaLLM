Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since there are multiple lesions mentioned, I'll focus on the most severe finding (Gleason 4+5=9 in macro B).

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The specimen is explicitly stated to be a "radical prostatectomy" (RP)
2. Malignancy: Cancer is present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. Gleason: Two different patterns are mentioned (4+3 in macro A and 4+5 in macro B). Following the instruction to report the most severe lesion, I've selected the higher Gleason score of 4+5=9 from macro B.
