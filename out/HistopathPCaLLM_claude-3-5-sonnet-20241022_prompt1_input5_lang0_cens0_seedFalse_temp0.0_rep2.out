Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since there are multiple lesions mentioned, I'll focus on the most severe finding (Gleason 4+5=9 in macro B).

{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. Malignancy is present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. The highest (most severe) Gleason score mentioned is 4+5=9 in macro B, which should be reported as it represents the most severe finding
