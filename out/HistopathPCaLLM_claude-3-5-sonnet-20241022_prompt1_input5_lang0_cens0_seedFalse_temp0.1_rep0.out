Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since there are multiple lesions mentioned, I'll focus on the most severe finding (Gleason 4+5=9 in macro B).

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. Malignancy is present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. The highest Gleason grade reported is 4+5=9 in macro B (which is more severe than the 4+3 pattern in macro A)
