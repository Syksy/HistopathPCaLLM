Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since multiple Gleason scores are mentioned (4+3 and 4+5), I'll use the most severe finding (4+5=9):

{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text clearly states "radical prostatectomy" which corresponds to "RP"
2. Malignancy: Cancer is present ("cancerous tissue is observed"), so it's "yes"
3. Gleason: Two scores are mentioned (4+3 and 4+5). Following the instruction to return the most severe lesion, I've selected "4+5=9" as it represents the higher grade.
