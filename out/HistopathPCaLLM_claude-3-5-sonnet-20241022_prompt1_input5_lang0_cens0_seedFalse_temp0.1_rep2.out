Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since multiple Gleason scores are mentioned (4+3 and 4+5), I'll use the most severe score (4+5=9) as instructed.

{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Explanation:
- Sampletype is "RP" (radical prostatectomy is explicitly mentioned)
- Malignancy is "yes" (cancerous tissue is observed)
- Gleason is "4+5=9" (this is the highest/most severe Gleason score mentioned in the text, found in macro B)
