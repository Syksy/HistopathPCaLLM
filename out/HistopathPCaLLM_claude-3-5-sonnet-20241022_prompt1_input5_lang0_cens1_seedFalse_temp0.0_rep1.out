Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate specimen examination, but it lacks clear definitive statements about malignancy and Gleason grades. Since the text mentions "prostate tissue" and multiple samples but doesn't explicitly confirm the specimen type, and doesn't clearly state malignant findings or specific Gleason grades, I'll use "NA" for uncertain or unspecified values.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy is not clearly stated (no explicit mention of cancer or adenocarcinoma)
3. While there's mention of Gleason classes, no specific grades are provided
