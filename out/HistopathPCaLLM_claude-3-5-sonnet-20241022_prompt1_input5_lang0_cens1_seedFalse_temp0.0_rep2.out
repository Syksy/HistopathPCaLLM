Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate specimen examination, but it lacks clear definitive statements about malignancy and Gleason grades. Since the text mentions "prostate tissue" and multiple samples but doesn't specify the exact procedure type clearly, and doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy or provide clear Gleason grades, I'll provide the most conservative interpretation:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is unclear - while it mentions multiple samples and appears to be a systematic sampling, it doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP
2. Malignancy is not clearly stated - the text only mentions "prostate tissue" without clear statement about malignancy
3. Gleason grade is explicitly noted as not being able to be inferred ("Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred")
