Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate specimen examination, but it lacks clear definitive statements about malignancy and Gleason grades. The text mentions prostate tissue examination but doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy or provide clear Gleason scores.

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" - The description suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen due to mentions of apex, basis, and complete prostate examination with multiple sections.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - While there's examination of prostate tissue, there's no clear statement about presence or absence of malignancy.
3. Gleason: "NA" - The text explicitly states that Gleason grades could not be inferred.
