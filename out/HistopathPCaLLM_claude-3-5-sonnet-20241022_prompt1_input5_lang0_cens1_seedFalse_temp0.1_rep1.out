Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate specimen examination, but it lacks clear definitive statements about malignancy and Gleason grades. Since the text is ambiguous and doesn't explicitly state the sample type or confirm malignancy, I'll use "NA" for uncertain values.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While it mentions prostate tissue and samples, it doesn't clearly specify if this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text doesn't explicitly state whether malignant findings were present or absent.
3. Gleason: While Gleason is mentioned, no specific grades are provided, and the text explicitly states that major and minor Gleason classes could not be inferred.
