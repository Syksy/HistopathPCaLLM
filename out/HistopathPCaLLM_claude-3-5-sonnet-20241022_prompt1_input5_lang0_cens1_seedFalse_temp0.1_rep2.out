Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The text appears to be describing a prostate specimen examination, but it lacks clear definitive statements about malignancy and Gleason grades. Since the text mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type clearly, and doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy or provide clear Gleason grades, I'll provide the most conservative interpretation:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy is not clearly stated (text discusses "suspected" findings but no definitive diagnosis)
3. Gleason grade is explicitly noted as not being able to be inferred ("Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred")
