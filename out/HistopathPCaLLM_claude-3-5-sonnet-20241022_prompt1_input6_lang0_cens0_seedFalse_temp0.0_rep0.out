Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) as evidenced by the mention of "shaving chips"
2. No malignancy is reported; the text only mentions benign prostate hyperplasia
3. Since no malignancy is present, Gleason score is not applicable (NA)
