Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. The description of "shaving chips" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimen
2. The statement describes only benign findings (benign prostate hyperplasia), with no mention of malignancy
3. Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grade is not applicable ("NA")
