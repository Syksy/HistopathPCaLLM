Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" that is "very fragmented," which is typical for TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimens.
2. Malignancy: Due to the heavy burn artifact and inconclusive results mentioned, no definitive statement about malignancy can be made, hence "NA".
3. Gleason: Since no cancer is definitively identified and results are inconclusive, Gleason grading is not applicable, hence "NA".
