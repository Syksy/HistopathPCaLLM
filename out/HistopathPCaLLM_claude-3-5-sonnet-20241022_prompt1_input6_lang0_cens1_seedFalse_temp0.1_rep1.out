Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement describes a surgical specimen (operation material) that is heavily damaged and inconclusive.

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "TURP" - The description mentions "fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material" which is typical for TURP specimens
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The findings are described as inconclusive due to technical issues (burn artifact), and no clear statement about malignancy is made
3. Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned, and due to the inconclusive nature of the specimen, no grading could be performed
