Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly a biopsy ("prostate biopsies")
2. While there is suspicion of adenocarcinoma, the statement explicitly mentions that the finding is inconclusive ("conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn"). Therefore, this should be considered as not definitively malignant.
3. Since no malignancy is definitively diagnosed, there can't be a Gleason grade, hence "NA"
