Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement describes an inconclusive finding with atypical structures but no definitive malignancy, and doesn't specify Gleason grades, here's the appropriate JSON structure:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: While the sample type isn't explicitly stated as "biopsy," the context of collecting "sample material" suggests this is a biopsy specimen. The finding is described as inconclusive with only atypical structures, which doesn't constitute a malignant diagnosis, hence "Malignancy" is "no". Since there's no mention of Gleason grading and no malignancy was confirmed, the Gleason field is "NA".
