Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement is inconclusive and doesn't specify malignancy or Gleason grades, and while it appears to be from a biopsy (based on context about sample material), I'll structure it as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This interpretation is based on:
- The text discusses sample material collection, suggesting a biopsy
- The findings are inconclusive ("no definite conclusions could be drawn")
- No specific mention of malignancy or Gleason grades
- The atypical findings were described as "diminishingly small" and inconclusive
