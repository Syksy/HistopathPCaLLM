Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since the statement describes an inconclusive finding with atypical structures but no definitive malignancy, and doesn't specify Gleason grades, I'll format it as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Note: I interpreted this as a biopsy based on the mention of "sample material" being "collected," though the sample type isn't explicitly stated. The malignancy is marked as "no" since the findings were described as inconclusive with no definitive cancer diagnosis. Since there's no mention of Gleason grading and no malignancy was confirmed, the Gleason field is marked as "NA".
