{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I've analyzed the text and structured the data based on the most severe findings:
1. The sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP) from sample 3
2. Malignant tumor is present ("tumor tissue is observed")
3. The Gleason grade is explicitly stated as 4+3=7

The lymph node findings were excluded as they're not the primary prostate tissue findings, and the PIN changes are pre-malignant findings that don't affect the main classification.
