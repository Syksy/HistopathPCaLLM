{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I've analyzed the statement and structured the data based on the most severe findings:
1. The sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy (RP) from sample 3
2. Malignant tumor is present ("tumor tissue is observed")
3. The Gleason grade is explicitly stated as 4+3=7

The lymph node findings were excluded as they're not the primary prostate tissue findings, and the statement about PIN changes was also excluded as it's not part of the main Gleason grading.
