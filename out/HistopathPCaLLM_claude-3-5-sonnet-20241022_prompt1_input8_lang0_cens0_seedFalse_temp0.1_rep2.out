Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
    "Sampletype": "RP",
    "Malignancy": "yes",
    "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "radical prostatectomy preparate" (RP)
2. Malignancy is present as tumor tissue is described with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7"

The statement contains multiple findings, but as per instructions, I've returned the most severe findings in a non-nested structure. The lymph node findings, while important clinically, are not relevant to the requested structured format.
