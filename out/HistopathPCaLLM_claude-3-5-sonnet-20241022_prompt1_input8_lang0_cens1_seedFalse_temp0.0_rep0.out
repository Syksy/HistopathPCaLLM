Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields. Since the statement is somewhat ambiguous and contains missing information, I'll provide the most conservative interpretation:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text refers to multiple samples with indices, which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy: "no" - While there are suspicious findings and PIN-changes discussed, the statement doesn't definitively confirm malignancy. The only clear statement about malignancy is that samples 1 and 2 were "free of malignant findings."
3. Gleason: "NA" - The text explicitly mentions that Gleason patterns are missing with "empty fields" and "no grade score is reported."
