Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) as evidenced by "electrosection shavings" being the sample material
2. Malignancy is explicitly stated as not present ("No malignant findings are observed")
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign case with no malignancy reported
