Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. From the description, this appears to be a technical report about sample processing, but the specific sample type is not clearly stated, and no definitive malignant findings or Gleason grades are mentioned.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type: Not specifically mentioned whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP
- Malignancy: While prostate tissue is mentioned as "rather normal," no clear statement about malignancy is made
- Gleason: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
