Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. From the description, this appears to be a technical report about sample processing, but the specific sample type is not clearly stated, and no definitive malignant findings or Gleason grades are mentioned.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be any type of prostate tissue)
- No clear malignant findings are reported (only mentions "normal" epithelial cells and some processing artifacts)
- No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
- The report appears to focus on technical processing issues rather than diagnostic findings
