Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. From the description, this appears to be a technical report about sample processing where no clear diagnostic conclusions are made, and the sample type is not explicitly stated.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: The text doesn't specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate
- Malignancy: While normal epithelial cells are mentioned, no clear statement about malignancy is made, so "NA" is appropriate
- Gleason: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text, so "NA" is appropriate
