Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. From the description, this appears to be a technical report about sample processing where no clear diagnostic conclusions are made, and the sample type is not explicitly stated.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type is not clearly specified in the text
- No malignancy is definitively reported (only mentions normal epithelial cells and some processing artifacts)
- No Gleason grade is mentioned
- The text primarily discusses technical aspects of sample processing and suggests potential processing errors
