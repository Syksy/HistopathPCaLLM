Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "chipping samples" indicates this is from a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "no... malignancies" and confirms benign findings.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign sample with no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA".
