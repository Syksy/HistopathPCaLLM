{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. "Chipping samples" indicates this is from a TURP procedure
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no... malignancies" and describes "benign prostate tissue"
3. Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA"
