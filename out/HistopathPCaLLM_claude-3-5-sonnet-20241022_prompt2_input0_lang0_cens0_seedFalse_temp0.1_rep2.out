{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. The mention of "chipping samples" indicates this is from a TURP procedure
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no... malignancies" and describes the tissue as benign
3. Since no malignancy was found, there can't be a Gleason score, hence "NA"
