Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While there is mention of "sample material," the specific type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not specified, hence "NA"
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and only mentions benign possibilities, so this is classified as "no"
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy reported, Gleason score is "NA"
