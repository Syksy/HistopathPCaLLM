Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text clearly mentions "prostate systematic biopsies", so "biopsy" is the correct sample type.
2. Malignancy: Although there is a suspicious focus, the conclusion explicitly states that the finding is leaning towards benign and no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma could be made. Therefore, this should be classified as "no" for malignancy.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy was definitively diagnosed, and consequently no Gleason grades were mentioned, this should be "NA".
