Based on the provided text, this appears to be a technical report about sample processing and staining quality rather than a proper histopathological diagnosis statement. The text discusses multiple samples and their staining characteristics but does not provide any clear diagnostic findings regarding malignancy or Gleason grading. Therefore, I will structure this as:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sample type: While prostate tissue is mentioned, the specific type of sampling procedure (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not specified
- Malignancy: No clear statement about presence or absence of malignancy
- Gleason: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
