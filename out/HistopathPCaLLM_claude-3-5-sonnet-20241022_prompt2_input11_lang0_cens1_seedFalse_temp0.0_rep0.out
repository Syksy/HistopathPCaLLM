Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Let's analyze:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't explicitly state whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, though it mentions "prostate tissue."

2. Malignancy: While the text discusses Gleason patterns, it explicitly states they "could not be reliably assessed." There's no clear statement about malignancy.

3. Gleason grade: Although Gleason patterns 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text specifically states they "could not be reliably assessed."

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This conservative interpretation is appropriate because:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated
- No definitive malignancy diagnosis is provided
- The Gleason scoring is explicitly stated as not being reliably assessed
