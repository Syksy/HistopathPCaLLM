Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Let's analyze:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't explicitly state whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen. While it mentions "prostate tissue," the specific sample type is not clear.

2. Malignancy: While the text discusses Gleason scores and mentions tubular structures of varying differentiation, it doesn't explicitly confirm or deny the presence of malignancy.

3. Gleason: Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text specifically states they "could not be reliably assessed," so no definitive Gleason score is provided.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
