Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be discussing prostate tissue examination, but lacks clear specification of sample type and definitive malignancy findings. While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are noted as "could not be reliably assessed."

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (whether biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No clear statement about presence or absence of malignancy
3. While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are explicitly stated as "could not be reliably assessed," so no definitive Gleason grade can be determined
