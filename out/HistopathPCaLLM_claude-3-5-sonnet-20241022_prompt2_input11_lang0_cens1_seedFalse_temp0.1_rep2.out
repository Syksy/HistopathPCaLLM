Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Let's analyze:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't explicitly state whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen. While it mentions "prostate tissue," the specific sample type is not clear.

2. Malignancy: While the text discusses Gleason scores and tissue architecture, it doesn't explicitly confirm or deny the presence of malignancy. The discussion is inconclusive.

3. Gleason grade: Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text specifically states they "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, no definitive Gleason score is provided.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
