{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because "electrosection shavings from the prostate" refers to transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "normal prostate tissue" and "classified as benign"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported
