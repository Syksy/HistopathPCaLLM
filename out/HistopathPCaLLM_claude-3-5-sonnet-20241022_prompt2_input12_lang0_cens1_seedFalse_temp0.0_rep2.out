Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the requested format. The statement is vague and doesn't provide clear information about the sample type, doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy (although mentions "prostate cancer tissue"), and contains no Gleason grade information.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Although it mentions a sample, it doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP
2. Malignancy: While it mentions "prostate cancer tissue," the statement is ambiguous as it's discussing the processing of samples rather than making a definitive diagnostic statement
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade information is provided in the statement
