Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be discussing a prostate examination but is inconclusive regarding definitive malignancy and doesn't mention specific Gleason grades. While it appears to be from a biopsy (given the mentions of samples from different locations), it describes suspicious findings that require further verification.

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (based on context of multiple samples from different locations)
- Malignancy: "NA" (suspicious findings are noted but no definitive malignancy is confirmed)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grades are mentioned in the text)
