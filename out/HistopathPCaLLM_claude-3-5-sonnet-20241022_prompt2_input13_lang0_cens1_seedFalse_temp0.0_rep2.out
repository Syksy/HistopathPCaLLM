Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it and structure the data according to the specified format.

The statement appears to be describing a prostate biopsy examination, but it doesn't explicitly confirm any malignancy or provide Gleason grades. It only mentions "some irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that require further inspection.

Therefore, I would structure this as:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (can be inferred from "samples have been taken" and mentions of sides of prostate)
- Malignancy: "NA" (no definitive statement about malignancy, only suspicious findings requiring further verification)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grading mentioned)
