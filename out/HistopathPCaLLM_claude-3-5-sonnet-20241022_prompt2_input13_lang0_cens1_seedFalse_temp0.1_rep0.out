Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it and structure the data according to the requirements:

1. While the text discusses prostate samples, it appears to be from a biopsy (due to mentions of samples from different locations and sides).
2. The text mentions "suspicious pattern" and "irregularities" but does not definitively confirm malignancy.
3. No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the structured JSON response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

The text appears to be describing a prostate biopsy examination, but since it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy and doesn't mention any Gleason grades, we must use "NA" for those values. The only clear element is that this is a biopsy sample.
