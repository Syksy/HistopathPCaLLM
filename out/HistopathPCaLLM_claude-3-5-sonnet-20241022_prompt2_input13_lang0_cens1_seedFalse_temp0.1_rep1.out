Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it and structure the data according to the requirements:

1. While the text discusses prostate samples, it appears to be from a biopsy (due to mentions of samples from different locations and sides).
2. The text mentions "suspicious pattern" and "irregularities" but does not definitively confirm malignancy.
3. No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the structured JSON response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

The text appears to be describing a prostate biopsy examination where some suspicious findings warrant further investigation, but no definitive malignancy diagnosis or Gleason grading is provided in the statement.
