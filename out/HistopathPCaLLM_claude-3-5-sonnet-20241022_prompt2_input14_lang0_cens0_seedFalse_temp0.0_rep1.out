I'll analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format.

The text describes:
1. Sample type: This is a prostatectomy specimen ("prostatetectomy preparate")
2. Malignancy: Yes, tumor is present ("tumorous growth is observed")
3. Gleason: The text mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Since score 3 is the larger portion (60%), and the total is 7, this implies a Gleason 3+4=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
