I'll analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. Sample type: This is a prostatectomy specimen ("prostatetectomy preparate"), so it's an RP (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy: Yes (tumorous growth is mentioned)
3. Gleason: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Since score 3 is the larger portion (60%), this indicates a 3+4=7 Gleason score.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
