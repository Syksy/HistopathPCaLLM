Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given requirements:

1. Sample type: This is a prostatectomy specimen ("prostatetectomy preparate"), so it's an RP
2. Malignancy: Yes, tumor is clearly mentioned ("tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma")
3. Gleason: The statement mentions Gleason 7 with "larger portion of score 3 approx 60%", which implies a 3+4=7 pattern

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
