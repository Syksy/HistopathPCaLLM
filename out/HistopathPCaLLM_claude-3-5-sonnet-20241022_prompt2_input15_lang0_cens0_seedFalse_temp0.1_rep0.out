Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma," indicating malignancy is present.
3. Gleason: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8," which implies a Gleason score of 4+4=8.
