Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While there is mention of "prostate tissue material," the specific type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not explicitly stated, hence "NA"
2. Malignancy: Although there is a suspicion mentioned in clinical notes, no definitive malignancy is confirmed in the histopathological examination, hence "NA"
3. Gleason: While there is mention of a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above in clinical notes, this is explicitly stated as not being based on histopathology and no Gleason grade was determined ("representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined"), hence "NA"
