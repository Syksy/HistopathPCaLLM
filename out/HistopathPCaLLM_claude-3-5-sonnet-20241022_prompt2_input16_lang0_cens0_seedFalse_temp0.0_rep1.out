Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "fusion biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as carcinoma is described
3. For Gleason grade, the statement describes grade 3 as predominant ("mainly level 3 grade growth") with less than one-third being grade 4, making this a 3+4=7 pattern. This is consistent with the explicit mention that "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part."
