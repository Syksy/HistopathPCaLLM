Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While the text mentions "prostate" and "sample material," it doesn't explicitly state whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: Although "suspicious foci" are mentioned, there's no definitive statement about malignancy, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: While the text mentions potential Gleason patterns (3+4 or 4+3), these are mentioned hypothetically in the context of grading difficulties, not as actual findings. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.

The statement primarily discusses technical difficulties with digital pathology assessment rather than providing definitive diagnostic information.
