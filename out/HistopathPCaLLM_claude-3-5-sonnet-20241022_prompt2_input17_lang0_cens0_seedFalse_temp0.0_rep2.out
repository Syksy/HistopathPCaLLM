Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text describes multiple tumor foci with Gleason patterns, indicating malignancy is present ("yes").
3. Gleason: The text mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". Since grade 4 is described as dominant and grade 3 as secondary, this should be structured as "4+3=7".
