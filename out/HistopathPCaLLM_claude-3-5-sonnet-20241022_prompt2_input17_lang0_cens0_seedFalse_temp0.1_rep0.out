I'll analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. This is clearly a prostatectomy (RP) specimen based on the detailed processing description.
2. There are clear malignant findings ("Multiple clear foci emerge").
3. The Gleason grading mentions grade 4 as dominant with some grade 3, which would be structured as 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

The reasoning:
- The sample type is explicitly mentioned as a prostatectomy specimen
- Malignancy is confirmed by multiple tumor foci and infiltration
- Gleason grading is mentioned with grade 4 being dominant and grade 3 as secondary, which translates to 4+3=7
