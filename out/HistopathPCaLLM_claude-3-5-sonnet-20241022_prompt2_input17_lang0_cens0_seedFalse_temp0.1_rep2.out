I'll analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. This is clearly a prostatectomy specimen ("Prostatectomy preparate")
2. There are malignant findings ("Multiple clear foci emerge")
3. The most severe Gleason pattern mentioned is grade 4 with some grade 3, making it a 4+3 pattern

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) based on the clear mention of prostatectomy
- Malignancy is "yes" based on the clear tumor findings
- Gleason is structured as "4+3=7" because the dominant pattern is mentioned as grade 4 with some grade 3, making grade 4 the primary and grade 3 the secondary pattern
