Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. Sample type: This is describing "chippings" obtained through "shaving procedure," which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.

2. Malignancy: Yes, carcinoma is explicitly mentioned ("a small fraction appears to be carcinoma").

3. Gleason grade: The statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" with "stage 3 representing about 60%." Since grade 3 is the dominant pattern (60%), and the sum is 7, this must be a 3+4=7 configuration.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
