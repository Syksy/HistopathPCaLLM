Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. Sample type: This is describing "chippings" obtained through "shaving procedure," which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.

2. Malignancy: Yes, carcinoma is explicitly mentioned ("a small fraction appears to be carcinoma").

3. Gleason grade: The statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" with the larger fraction being stage 3 representing 60%. Since the larger component is pattern 3 (60%), this would be a 3+4=7 Gleason score.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
