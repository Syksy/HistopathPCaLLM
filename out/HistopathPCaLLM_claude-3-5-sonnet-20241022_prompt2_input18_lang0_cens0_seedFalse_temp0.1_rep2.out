Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format:

1. Sample type: This is describing "chippings" obtained through "shaving procedure," which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.

2. Malignancy: Yes, there is clear mention of carcinoma.

3. Gleason grade: The statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" with stage 3 being the dominant pattern (60%). Since pattern 3 is dominant (60%), and the sum is 7, this must be a 3+4=7 configuration.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
