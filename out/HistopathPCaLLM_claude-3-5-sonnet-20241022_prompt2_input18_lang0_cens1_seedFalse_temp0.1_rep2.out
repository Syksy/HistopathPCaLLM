Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requirements:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The text mentions "standard prostate related procedures" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so this is "NA"
2. Malignancy: While there is a mention of a suspicious focus requiring further investigation, >95% is described as benign and no definitive malignancy is reported. The suspicious area is too small to properly grade and is only mentioned as a possibility. Therefore, this should be considered "no"
3. Gleason: Since no definitive malignancy is identified and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned (only a hypothetical reference to possible ISUP GG 1), this is "NA"
