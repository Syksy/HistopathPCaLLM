Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Explanation:
1. Sampletype: The text clearly states these are "targeted prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy: "yes" because adenocarcinoma is found in sample 4
3. Gleason: Based on the description in sample 4, there is Gleason 3 (90%) as the primary pattern and Gleason 4 (10%) as the secondary pattern, which results in "3+4=7"
