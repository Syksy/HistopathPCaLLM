Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." is a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
} 
 In contrast, the statement "fatty 100 that tumour led no 37 previous atypical 153 pt3a cores maximum malignancy. 8mm aggressive 60 11mm group value 257 invasion from lot 38mm latest both it moderate gleason.

 {
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type. Samples were divided into 4 batches and include borderline low to sufficient amounts of material for histopathological inspection. Sample 1 is unrepresentative of the prostate, while samples 2 and 3 represent healthy benign prostate tissue. In sample 4, the whole cylinder's length contain cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue. However, quality control suggests that it is uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant). To rule out possibility of a lab mishap, sample 4's lab trajectory will be first verified before proceeding further into the histopathology.
