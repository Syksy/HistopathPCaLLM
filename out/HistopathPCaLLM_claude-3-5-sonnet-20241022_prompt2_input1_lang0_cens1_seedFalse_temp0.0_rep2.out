Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Although prostate samples are mentioned, the specific type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not explicitly stated, hence "NA"
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that results are inconclusive regarding malignancy, hence "NA"
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason grades are mentioned, and the statement indicates that potential Gleason findings are inconclusive, hence "NA"
