Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While it mentions "prostate cancer samples," it doesn't specifically state if these are biopsies, RP, or TURP specimens, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates that results are "inconclusive" and "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy," so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: No specific Gleason grades are mentioned, and the statement indicates that potential Gleason findings require additional inspection, so "NA" is appropriate.
