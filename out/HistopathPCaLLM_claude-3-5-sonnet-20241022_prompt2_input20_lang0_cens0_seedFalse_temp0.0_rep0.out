Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly a prostatectomy resection ("RP")
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as adenocarcinoma is described
3. For the Gleason grade, since we should report the most severe lesion, I've selected "4+4=8" from the basis, which is more severe than the "3+4" found in the apex.
