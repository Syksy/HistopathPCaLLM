Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement describes a case where proper assessment is impossible due to prior treatments affecting the tissue, and no definitive findings can be made. Therefore:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" that are divided into sets from different regions, indicating a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The text explicitly states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" due to therapy effects.
3. Gleason: "NA" - While the text hypothetically mentions "3+4", this is only used as an example and not an actual finding. No definitive Gleason score is reported.
