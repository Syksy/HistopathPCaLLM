Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement describes a case where proper assessment is impossible due to prior treatments, and no clear malignancy or Gleason grading can be determined. While prostate tissue samples are mentioned, their examination is compromised.

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (based on mention of "prostate tissue samples")
- Malignancy: "NA" (examination is stated to be impossible due to prior therapies)
- Gleason: "NA" (no definitive Gleason score is given; only a hypothetical mention of "such as 3+4" which is not an actual finding)
