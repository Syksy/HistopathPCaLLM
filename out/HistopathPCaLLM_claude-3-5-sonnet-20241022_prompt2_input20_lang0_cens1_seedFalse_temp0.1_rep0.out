Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement describes a prostate tissue examination where analysis is impossible due to prior treatments, and no definitive findings can be made. While the text mentions a hypothetical Gleason score (3+4), this is not an actual finding.

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (text mentions "prostate tissue samples")
- Malignancy: "NA" (examination is described as "impossible" due to therapy effects)
- Gleason: "NA" (no actual Gleason score is reported; the 3+4 mentioned is only hypothetical)
