{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I arrived at this structured data because:
1. "Prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The description of "poorly differentiated growth," enlarged nuclei, and Gleason grades clearly indicates malignant findings
3. The statement mentions "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4," which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9 (using the most prevalent and second most prevalent patterns)
