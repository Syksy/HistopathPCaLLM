{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I arrived at this structured data because:
1. "Prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP procedure
2. The description of "poorly differentiated growth," enlarged nuclei, and tumor-like tissue clearly indicates malignancy
3. The statement mentions "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4," which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9 (using the most severe/common pattern as the primary grade)
