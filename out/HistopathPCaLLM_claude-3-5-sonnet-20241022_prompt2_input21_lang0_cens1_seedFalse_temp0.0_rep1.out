Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it according to the requested fields:

1. Sample type: While the statement mentions "extracted prostate material" in fragments, it's most likely from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) given the description of multiple fragments and weight measurement.

2. Malignancy: The statement doesn't make any clear determination about malignancy. Due to poor quality of the specimen and dissolved nuclei, no definitive diagnosis is made.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned or could be determined due to the poor quality of the specimen.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
