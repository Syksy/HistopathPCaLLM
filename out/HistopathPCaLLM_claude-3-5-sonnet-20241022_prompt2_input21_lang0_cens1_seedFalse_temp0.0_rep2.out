Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "TURP" - The description mentions "extracted prostate material" in fragments with weight measurement, which is typical for TURP specimens.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - Due to poor specimen quality and dissolved nuclei, no definitive assessment of malignancy can be made.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined due to quality issues, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
