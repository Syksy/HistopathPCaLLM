Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it according to the requested structure:

1. Sample type: While the statement mentions "extracted prostate material" in fragments, it's most likely from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) given the description of multiple fragments and weight measurement.

2. Malignancy: The statement doesn't make any clear determination about malignancy due to poor quality of the specimen and dissolved nuclei.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned or possible due to the poor quality of the specimen.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

The "NA" values are used because the specimen quality issues prevented proper assessment of malignancy and Gleason grading.
