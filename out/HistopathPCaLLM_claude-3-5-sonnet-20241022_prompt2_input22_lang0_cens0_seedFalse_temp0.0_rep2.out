I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and structure it according to the requested format.

The statement describes:
- It's clearly a biopsy specimen (thick needle biopsies)
- Malignant findings are present (carcinoma on the left side)
- Gleason grades are mentioned (3 and 4, with 3 being primary and 4 being secondary)

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Note: While the Gleason grades 3 and 4 are mentioned separately in the text, the convention is to report them as primary+secondary=sum format. Since the text mentions "mainly" grade 3 with some grade 4, this indicates that grade 3 is the primary pattern and grade 4 is the secondary pattern, hence 3+4=7.
