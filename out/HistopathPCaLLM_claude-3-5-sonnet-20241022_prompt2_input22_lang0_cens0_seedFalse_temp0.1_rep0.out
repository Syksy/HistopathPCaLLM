I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and structure it according to the requested format.

Analysis:
- Sample type is clearly a biopsy (thick needle biopsies)
- Malignancy is present (carcinoma found on left side)
- Gleason grades are mentioned (3 and 4, with 3 being primary and 4 secondary)

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Note: While the Gleason grades 3 and 4 are mentioned separately in the text, based on the description that grade 3 is "firstly" mentioned and grade 4 "secondly," this indicates a 3+4 pattern. The sum (7) is implied by combining these grades.
