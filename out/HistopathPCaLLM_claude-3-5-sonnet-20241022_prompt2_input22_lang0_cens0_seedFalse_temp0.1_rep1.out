I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and structure it according to the requested format.

The statement describes:
- It's clearly a biopsy specimen (thick needle biopsies)
- Malignant findings are present (carcinoma on the left side)
- Gleason grades are mentioned (3 and 4, with 3 being primary and 4 being secondary)

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Note: While the Gleason grades 3 and 4 are mentioned separately in the text, when 3 is mentioned first and 4 second in the context of prostate cancer grading, this typically indicates a 3+4 pattern, resulting in a sum of 7.
