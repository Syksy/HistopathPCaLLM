Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with specific fragment lengths, which indicates this is a biopsy specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies," so this is marked as "NA".
3. Gleason: Since malignancy couldn't be assessed and the text mentions difficulty in assigning Gleason scores, this is marked as "NA".
