Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text describes prostate tissue sampling material with specific fragment lengths, which indicates a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement explicitly mentions that malignancies cannot be assessed due to the condition of the samples.
3. Gleason: "NA" - The text states that assigning a Gleason score is "exceptionally difficult" and the samples need to be reprocessed, so no valid Gleason score is provided.
