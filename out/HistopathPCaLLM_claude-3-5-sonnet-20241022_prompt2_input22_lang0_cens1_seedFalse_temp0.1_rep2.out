Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The description mentions prostate tissue sampling with specific fragment lengths, which is characteristic of biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement explicitly mentions that malignancy cannot be assessed due to sample quality issues.
3. Gleason: "NA" - The statement indicates that Gleason grading cannot be performed due to the wide range of cell architectures and sample quality concerns.
