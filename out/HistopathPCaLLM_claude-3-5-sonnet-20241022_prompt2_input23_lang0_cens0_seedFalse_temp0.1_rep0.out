{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" as it mentions "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as it clearly describes an adenocarcinoma
3. Gleason score is "4+5=9" because:
   - Grade 4 is mentioned as the main component (60%)
   - Grade 5 is the second most common (30%)
   - Grade 3 is only tertiary (minimal)
   - The conclusion explicitly states "Gleason-score sum 9"
   - In such cases, the two most prevalent grades (4+5) form the final Gleason score
