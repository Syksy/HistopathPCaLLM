Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement discusses a sample investigation but does not clearly specify the sample type, does not definitively confirm malignancy (only mentions a prior potential Gleason 3 finding), and does not provide a definitive current Gleason score. Therefore:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This structured response reflects that:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated in the text
2. No definitive malignancy is confirmed in the current examination
3. No definitive Gleason score is provided (only a mention of a prior potential finding)
