Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given rules:

1. Sample type: Multiple types are mentioned (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings), but since we can't specify a single type, this should be "NA"

2. Malignancy: While initially benign, some cases were upgraded to malignant (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4), so malignancy was present in some cases - "yes"

3. Gleason: The most severe grade mentioned is Gleason 3+4=7

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
