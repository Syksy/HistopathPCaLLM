I'll analyze this prostate biopsy statement and structure it according to the requirements.

This is clearly a biopsy sample (multiple cores with measurements in mm) with malignant findings (adenocarcinoma). For the Gleason score, we need to identify the most severe lesion. Looking at the samples:

Sample 1: Gleason patterns 4 (20%) and 3 (30%)
Sample 2: Gleason patterns 4 (15%) and 3 (35%)
Sample 3: No tumor

The most severe lesion appears in Sample 1 with higher percentage of pattern 4. Since pattern 4 is the most prevalent cancer pattern and pattern 3 is the second most prevalent, this would be structured as Gleason 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
