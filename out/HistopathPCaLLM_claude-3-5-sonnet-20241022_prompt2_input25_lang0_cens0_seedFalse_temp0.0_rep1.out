I'll analyze this prostate biopsy statement and structure the data according to the requirements.

This is clearly a biopsy sample (multiple cores with measurements in mm) with malignant findings (adenocarcinoma). For the Gleason score, we need to identify the most severe lesion. Looking at the samples:

Sample 1: Gleason patterns 4 (20%) and 3 (30%)
Sample 2: Gleason patterns 4 (15%) and 3 (35%)
Sample 3: No tumor

The most severe lesion is in Sample 1, with Gleason pattern 4 as the most prevalent pattern (considering the ratio of pattern percentages), followed by pattern 3. Therefore, this would be scored as Gleason 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
