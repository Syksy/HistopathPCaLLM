Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the specified requirements:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text describes multiple tissue samples being examined, which is characteristic of a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: The conclusion explicitly states that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified," so this is clearly "NA".
3. Gleason: Since malignancy couldn't be verified and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned, this is "NA".
