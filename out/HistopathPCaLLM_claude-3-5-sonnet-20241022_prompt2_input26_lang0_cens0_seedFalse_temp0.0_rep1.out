I'll analyze this statement and structure it according to the given requirements:

1. Sample type: This is clearly a prostatectomy (RP) specimen
2. Malignancy: Yes, there is a tumor present ("reveals a widely spread tumor")
3. Gleason: The statement mentions "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent", which indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
