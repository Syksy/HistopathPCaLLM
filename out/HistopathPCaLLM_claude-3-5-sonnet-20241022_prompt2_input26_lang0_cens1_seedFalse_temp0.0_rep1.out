Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While the text mentions prostate material with apex and basis samples (suggesting biopsy), I've marked it as "biopsy" based on the sampling description.
2. Malignancy: Although there's a mention of a possible historical Gleason score, the current specimen cannot be properly assessed due to radiation therapy changes. Therefore, malignancy status is "NA".
3. Gleason: While there's a mention of a possible "Gleason sum 7", this is noted as historical/uncertain information, and the current specimen cannot be properly graded due to radiation therapy changes. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".
