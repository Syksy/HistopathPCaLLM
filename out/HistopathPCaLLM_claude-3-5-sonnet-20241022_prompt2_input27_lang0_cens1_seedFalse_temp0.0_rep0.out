Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it and structure the data:

The statement is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, though it mentions "prostate tissue" being "run in batches." The malignancy status is unclear, with only a tentative mention of possible Gleason 3 pattern "in small quantities." Given the uncertainty and lack of clear diagnostic information, this should be treated as an invalid or inconclusive pathological statement.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This structured response reflects that:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified
2. No definitive malignancy is reported
3. While Gleason 3 is mentioned, it's speculative ("could maybe be seen") and doesn't provide a complete Gleason score with primary and secondary patterns
