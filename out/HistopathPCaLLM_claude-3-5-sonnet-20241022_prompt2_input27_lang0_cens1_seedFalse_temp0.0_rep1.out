Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it and structure the data:

The statement is somewhat ambiguous and doesn't clearly indicate the sample type or definitively state malignancy. While there's a mention of Gleason score 3, it's described as "debatable" and "maybe" in "small quantities," which doesn't constitute a definitive finding. The statement appears to be discussing laboratory processing rather than a formal pathology report.

Therefore, I'll structure this as:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because:
1. The sample type isn't clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP
2. There's no definitive statement about malignancy
3. While Gleason 3 is mentioned, it's not in a definitive context or proper format (no complete Gleason score is given)
