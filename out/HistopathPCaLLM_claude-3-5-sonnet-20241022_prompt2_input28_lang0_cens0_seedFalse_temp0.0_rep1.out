{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The text clearly states these are "biopsy cylinders"
2. Malignant findings (adenocarcinoma) are present
3. Among the three foci described (4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7), the most severe finding was in focus 1 with Gleason 4+4=8, which is explicitly stated in the summary ("the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8")
