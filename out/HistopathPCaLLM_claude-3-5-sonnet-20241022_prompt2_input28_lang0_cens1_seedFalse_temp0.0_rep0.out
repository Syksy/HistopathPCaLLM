Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While not explicitly stated, the description of multiple regions of interest and mention of PSA status suggests this is a prostate biopsy specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text describes atypical growth patterns and possible pre-malignant changes, but no definitive malignancy is reported. Therefore, this is classified as "no".
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is definitively identified, and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this is "NA".
