Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format.

The text describes a prostate specimen examination, which appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of multiple sections from different parts of the prostate and the mention of weight.

There is clear mention of invasive adenocarcinoma (malignant finding).

Regarding Gleason grading, while it mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" and "smaller portion as grade 4" (which seems to be a typo as it mentions grade 4 twice), and provides a "Score sum 7", it doesn't explicitly state the primary and secondary patterns. However, given that grade 4 is mentioned as the predominant pattern, and the sum is 7, we can deduce it's likely 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
