Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format.

The text describes a prostate specimen examination, which appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of systematic sampling from different zones of the prostate and the mention of the specimen weight.

There is clear mention of invasive adenocarcinoma (malignant finding).

Regarding Gleason grading, while the text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" and "with the smaller portion as grade 4" (which seems to be a typographical error as it mentions grade 4 twice), and provides a "Score sum 7", it doesn't explicitly state the primary and secondary patterns. However, given that it mentions grade 4 as the predominant pattern, and we know the sum is 7, we can deduce it must be 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
