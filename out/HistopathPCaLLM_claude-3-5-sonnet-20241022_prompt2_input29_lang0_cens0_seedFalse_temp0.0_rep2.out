Let me analyze this statement and structure it according to the given format.

This appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen description based on the systematic sampling method described and the mention of the prostate weight. There is clear mention of malignancy (invasive adenocarcinoma). Regarding the Gleason score, while it mentions "score sum 7" and describes grade 4 patterns, there's some ambiguity in the text (it mentions "grade 4" twice). However, since it mentions grade 4 as the predominant pattern, and we know the sum is 7, we can deduce it's 4+3=7.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
