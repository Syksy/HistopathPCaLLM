Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Let's analyze:

1. Sample type: While it mentions "prostate tissue" and samples, it appears to be from a biopsy procedure given the systematic sampling pattern described (left/right, lower/middle/higher).

2. Malignancy: The text is inconclusive about malignancy. While it mentions "tumor cells" in context of what cannot be assessed, and discusses potential poor differentiation, no definitive malignant findings are stated.

3. Gleason grade: The text explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible."

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
