Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is indicated by "prostatectomy specimen"
2. Malignancy: "no" because the statement describes only benign findings ("normal benign growth", "hyperplasia", "low inflammatory state")
3. Gleason: "NA" because there are no malignant findings, and therefore no Gleason score is applicable
