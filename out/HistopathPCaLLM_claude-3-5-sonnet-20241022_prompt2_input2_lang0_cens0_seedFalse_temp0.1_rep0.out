Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" - The text clearly mentions "prostatectomy specimen"
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement describes only benign findings, with no mention of malignancy or cancer
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since no malignancy is present, no Gleason score is applicable
