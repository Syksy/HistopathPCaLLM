{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data this way because:
1. The sample is explicitly described as a "prostatectomy specimen" (RP)
2. The statement clearly indicates benign findings only ("normal benign growth", "no abnormal growth", and no mention of malignancy or cancer)
3. Since there is no malignancy reported, Gleason score is not applicable (NA)
