Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) - This is clear from "prostatectomy specimen" in the text
2. Malignancy: "no" - The text describes only benign findings and explicitly states "normal benign growth"
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason score is applicable
