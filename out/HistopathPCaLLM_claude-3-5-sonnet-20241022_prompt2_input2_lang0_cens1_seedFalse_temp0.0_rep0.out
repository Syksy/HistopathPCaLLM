Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since this is an autopsy specimen where no clear malignancy is stated and no Gleason grades are mentioned, and the findings are inconclusive, the structured data should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While it's mentioned as an autopsy specimen, this doesn't fit into the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"), so it should be "NA"
2. Malignancy: The text mentions potential adenocarcinoma but is inconclusive ("cannot be reliable inferred"), so this should be "NA"
3. Gleason: No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text, so this should be "NA"
