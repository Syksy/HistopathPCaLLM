Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement describes an autopsy specimen with inconclusive findings, where no clear malignancy is established and no Gleason grade is mentioned.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While it mentions "autopsy specimen," this doesn't fit into the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"), so it should be "NA"
2. Malignancy: The findings are inconclusive ("cannot be reliable inferred"), so this should be "NA"
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text, so this should be "NA"
