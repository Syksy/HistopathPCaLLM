Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since this is an autopsy specimen where no clear malignancy is stated (only potential adenocarcinoma is mentioned as something that needs further investigation), and no Gleason grades are mentioned, I would structure it as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: While it's mentioned as an autopsy specimen, this doesn't fit into the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"), so it should be "NA"
- Malignancy: Since no definitive malignancy is reported (only mentioned as something that needs further investigation), this should be "no"
- Gleason: Since no malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this should be "NA"
