Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. Since this is an autopsy specimen with inconclusive findings regarding malignancy, and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While it mentions "autopsy specimen," this doesn't fit into the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"), so it should be "NA"
2. Malignancy: The text states that findings "cannot be reliable inferred" and potential adenocarcinoma needs "further inspection," so this is inconclusive and should be "NA"
3. Gleason: No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text, so this should be "NA"
