{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I arrived at this structured data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type: The mention of "chippings" and "urothelial cells" suggests this is from a TURP procedure.
2. Malignancy: The text confirms adenocarcinoma diagnosis, so this is malignant.
3. Gleason: The text mentions grade 4 as most common pattern and grade 3 as secondary pattern (with tertiary 5). Following standard reporting guidelines, we report the most severe combination of primary and secondary patterns, which in this case is 4+3=7. The tertiary pattern, while noted, is not included in the structured Gleason score.
