Based on the provided statement, this appears to be a consultation note discussing uncertain findings, without clear histopathological information. There is no clear indication of sample type, no definitive malignancy determination, and no Gleason grade mentioned. Therefore, I will structure this as:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is appropriate because:
1. The statement doesn't specify what type of sample was examined
2. The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain ("could not confirm or deny")
3. No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
