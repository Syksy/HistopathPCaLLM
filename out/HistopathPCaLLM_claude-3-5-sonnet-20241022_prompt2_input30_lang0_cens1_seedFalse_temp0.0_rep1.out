Based on the provided statement, this appears to be a consultation note discussing uncertain findings, without clear histopathological information. There is no clear indication of sample type, no definitive malignancy determination, and no Gleason grade information. Therefore, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is appropriate because:
1. The sample type is not mentioned in the text
2. The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain ("could not confirm or deny")
3. No Gleason grade information is provided
