Based on the provided statement, this appears to be a consultation note discussing uncertain findings, without clear histopathological information. There is no clear indication of sample type, no definitive malignancy status, and no Gleason grade information. Therefore, I will structure this as:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is appropriate because:
1. The text doesn't specify any sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain ("could not confirm or deny")
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text
