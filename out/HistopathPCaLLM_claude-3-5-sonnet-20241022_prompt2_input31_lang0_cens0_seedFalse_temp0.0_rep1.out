I'll analyze this statement and structure the data according to the requirements.

The statement describes multiple biopsies with different findings, but as per instructions, we should return the results from the most severe lesion. In this case, it's from the second targeted biopsy which revealed a more aggressive tumor with primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5.

Here's the structured response in JSON format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

This structured data represents:
1. Sample type is clearly a biopsy
2. Malignancy is present
3. Gleason grade is derived from the most severe finding (primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5, sum 9)
