I'll analyze this statement and structure the data according to the requirements.

The statement describes multiple biopsies with different findings, but as per instructions, we should return the results from the most severe lesion. In this case, it's from the second targeted biopsy which shows a more aggressive pattern.

The key findings are:
- Sample type is biopsy
- Malignant tumor is present
- The most severe Gleason pattern described is primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5

Here's the structured response in JSON format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
