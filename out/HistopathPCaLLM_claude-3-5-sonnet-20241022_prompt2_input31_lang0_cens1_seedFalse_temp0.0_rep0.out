Based on the provided text, I will structure the data according to the specified requirements.

The given statement does not clearly indicate:
1. The specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Whether there is definitive malignancy (only "suspicious findings" mentioned)
3. Any Gleason grade information

Therefore, the appropriate structured response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because the statement, while describing a clinical situation, does not provide the specific histopathological information required for more detailed classification. The text mentions "suspicious findings" but does not confirm malignancy, and no specific sample type or Gleason grades are mentioned.
