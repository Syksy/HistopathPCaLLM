Based on the provided text, I will structure the data according to the specified requirements.

The statement appears to be a clinical note discussing a patient's symptoms and sampling process, but it lacks specific information about the sample type, clear malignancy confirmation, and Gleason grading. The text is not a proper histopathological statement and doesn't contain the required specific information.

Therefore, the structured response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated (biopsy/RP/TURP)
2. While "suspicious findings" are mentioned, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text
