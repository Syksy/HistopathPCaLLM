Based on the provided text, I will structure the data according to the specified rules.

The given statement does not clearly indicate:
1. The specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Whether there is definitive malignancy (only "suspicious findings" mentioned)
3. Any Gleason grade information

Therefore, the appropriate structured response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because the statement, while discussing medical context, does not provide the specific histopathological information required for more detailed classification. The text mentions "samples" but doesn't specify the type, mentions "suspicious findings" but doesn't confirm malignancy, and contains no Gleason grade information.
