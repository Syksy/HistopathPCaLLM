{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I selected these values because:
1. The sample type is clearly stated as "radical prostatectomy" (RP)
2. Malignancy is present as indicated by "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate"
3. For the Gleason grade, multiple patterns were mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), but as per instructions, I selected the most severe grade which is 4+4=8
