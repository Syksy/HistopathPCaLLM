{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as clearly stated in the text.
2. Malignancy is "yes" as the text mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate."
3. For Gleason grade, multiple patterns were mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3), but as per instructions, I returned the most severe grade which is 4+4=8.
