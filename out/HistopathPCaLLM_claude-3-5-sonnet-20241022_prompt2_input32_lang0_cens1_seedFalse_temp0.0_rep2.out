Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it according to the requested structured format:

1. The text mentions prostate tissue but doesn't clearly specify if it's from a biopsy, TURP, or RP.
2. No clear mention of malignant findings.
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned.

The statement appears to be a general description of multiple samples and their measurements, but lacks specific diagnostic information about malignancy or Gleason grading.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
