{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Note: I selected "4+3" as the Gleason grade since in cases where multiple grades are mentioned, we should report the most severe finding. Between "3+4" and "4+3", the latter represents a more aggressive pattern and is therefore reported in the structured data.
