{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Note: I selected "4+3" as the Gleason grade since in cases where multiple grades are mentioned (here "3+4/4+3"), we should report the most severe finding, and 4+3=7 is considered more severe than 3+4=7 even though they have the same sum.
