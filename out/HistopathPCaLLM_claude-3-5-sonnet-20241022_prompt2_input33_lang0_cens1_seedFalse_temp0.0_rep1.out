Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format.

The given text is not a clear histopathological statement about prostate cancer. It contains general information about sample processing and vague mentions of findings without specific details about sample type, clear malignancy status, or Gleason grades. Therefore, all fields should be marked as "NA".

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
