Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format.

The given text is a general description of sample processing and findings but lacks specific information about:
1. The specific sample type (biopsy/RP/TURP)
2. Clear malignant tumor findings (though it mentions "no malignant findings in seminal vehicles")
3. Any Gleason grade information

Since the statement lacks the specific required information, I will return:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
