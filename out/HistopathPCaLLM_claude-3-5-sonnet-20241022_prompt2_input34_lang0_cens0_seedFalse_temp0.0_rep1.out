{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because it's described as a resection with a specific weight in grams, which is typical for transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens.
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities."
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign finding without any malignancy, therefore no Gleason grade is applicable.
