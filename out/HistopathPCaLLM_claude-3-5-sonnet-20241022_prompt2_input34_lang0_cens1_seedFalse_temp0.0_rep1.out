Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it and structure the data:

1. Sample type: While not explicitly stated, the weight and cassette preparation suggests this is likely a TURP specimen
2. Malignancy: No malignancy is mentioned; the findings describe hyperplastic tissue with inflammation
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is present, no Gleason score is applicable

Therefore, the structured JSON response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
