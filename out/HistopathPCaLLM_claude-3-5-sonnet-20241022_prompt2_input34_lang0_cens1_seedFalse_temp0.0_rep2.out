Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it and structure the data:

1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, but given the weight and tissue cassettes, this appears to be a TURP specimen.
2. No malignancy is mentioned; instead, hyperplastic changes and inflammation are described.
3. Since no malignancy is present, there is no Gleason grade to report.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
