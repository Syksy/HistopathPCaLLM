Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly indicated as "prostate biopsies"
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of carcinoma," indicating no malignancy
3. Since there is no malignancy, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
