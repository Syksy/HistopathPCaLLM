Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: While not explicitly stated, the mention of "left and right lobe" samples suggests this is from a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement only mentions PIN-changes and hyperplasia, which are non-malignant findings.
3. Gleason: Since there is no mention of cancer or Gleason grading, and the findings are benign, this is marked as "NA".
