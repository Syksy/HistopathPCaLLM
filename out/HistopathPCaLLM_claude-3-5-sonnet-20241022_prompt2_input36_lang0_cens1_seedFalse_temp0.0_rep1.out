Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be TURP or RP based on context, but since it's not explicitly stated, we use "NA")
2. The statement only mentions hyperplasia (benign condition) with no mention of malignancy, so "no"
3. Since there is no malignancy mentioned, Gleason score is "NA"
