Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement only mentions hyperplasia (benign condition) with no mention of malignancy, so "no" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is reported, there can't be a Gleason score, so "NA" is appropriate.
