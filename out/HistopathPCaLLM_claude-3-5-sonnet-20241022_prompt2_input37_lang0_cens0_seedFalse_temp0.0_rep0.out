Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "electrosection chippings" indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement only mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, with no mention of malignancy, so this is a benign finding.
3. Gleason: Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason score is "NA".
