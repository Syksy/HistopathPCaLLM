Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be a partial examination of prostate tissue, but it:
- Doesn't specify the sample type clearly
- Doesn't mention any malignancy
- Doesn't mention any Gleason grades

Therefore, the structured response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No clear statement about malignancy is made
3. No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
