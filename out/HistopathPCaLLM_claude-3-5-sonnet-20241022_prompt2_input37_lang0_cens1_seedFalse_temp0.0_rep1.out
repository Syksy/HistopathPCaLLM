Explanation: This statement is a pathology report describing prostate tissue examination, but it doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), doesn't make any clear statement about malignancy, and contains no Gleason grade information. The report appears to be incomplete, indicating further examination is needed. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" (Not Available).
