Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be a partial examination of prostate tissue, but it:
- Doesn't specify the sample type clearly
- Doesn't mention any malignancy
- Doesn't mention any Gleason grades

Therefore, the structured response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

The statement only describes some benign findings (nodular gland components and minor inflammation) and indicates that the examination is incomplete and will continue later, but lacks the specific information requested for the structured fields.
