Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as indicated by "needle biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "No suspected malignity"
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign finding (no cancer present)
