{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" because it mentions "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" because it describes tumor findings with Gleason grading
3. Gleason is "3+4=7" because it specifically mentions Gleason 3 as major and 4 as the other differentiation stage, resulting in a sum of 7
