Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's "NA"
2. Malignancy is explicitly stated as uncertain ("not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings"), so it's "NA"
3. Gleason score is explicitly stated as unable to be assessed, so it's "NA"
