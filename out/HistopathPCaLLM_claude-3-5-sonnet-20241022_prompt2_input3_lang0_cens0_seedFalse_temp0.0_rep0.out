Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found," so this is clearly benign.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA".
