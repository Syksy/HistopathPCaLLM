Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The description mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" in a "single run," which is typical for TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimens.
2. Malignancy: Due to burn artifacts and the statement that "nothing conclusive may be derived," we cannot determine malignancy status, hence "NA"
3. Gleason: Since malignancy cannot be determined and no Gleason grades are mentioned, this is "NA"
