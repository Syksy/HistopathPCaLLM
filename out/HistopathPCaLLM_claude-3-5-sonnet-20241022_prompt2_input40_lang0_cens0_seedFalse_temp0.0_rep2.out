Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "shaving material" indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia," indicating no malignancy.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade is applicable, hence "NA".
