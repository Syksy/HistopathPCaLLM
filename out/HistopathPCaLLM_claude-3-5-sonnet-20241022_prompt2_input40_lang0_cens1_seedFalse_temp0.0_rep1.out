Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- The sample type is not clearly specified in the text (could be TURP or RP based on the weight, but it's not explicitly stated)
- No clear malignant findings are reported (only hyperplasia and inflammation are mentioned with uncertainty about "something else")
- No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text

Therefore, all fields are set to "NA" due to insufficient specific information in the statement.
