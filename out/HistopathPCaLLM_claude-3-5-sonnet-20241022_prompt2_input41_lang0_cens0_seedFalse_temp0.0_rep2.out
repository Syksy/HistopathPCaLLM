Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly "biopsy" as it mentions "systematic biopsies"
2. Malignancy is "no" as it explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason score is "NA" as this is a benign case with no cancer present
