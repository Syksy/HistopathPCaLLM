Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text mentions samples collected from prostate lobes, which indicates a biopsy procedure.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement explicitly mentions uncertainty about cancer-related changes ("Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not").
3. Gleason: "NA" - No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since malignancy is uncertain, Gleason grade cannot be determined.
