Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While a prostate sample is mentioned, the specific type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not clearly stated, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions uncertainty about whether findings represent cancer or inflammation ("cannot be determined"), so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since malignancy is uncertain, "NA" is appropriate.
