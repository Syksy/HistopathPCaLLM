Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the statement mentions "prostate chippings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) specimens
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign case with no malignancy reported
