{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I determined this structure because:
1. The mention of "prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. The statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma" indicating no malignancy
3. Since there is no malignancy, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
