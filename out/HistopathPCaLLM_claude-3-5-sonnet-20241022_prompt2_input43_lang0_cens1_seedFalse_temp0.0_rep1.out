Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The mention of "30g prostate samples" suggests this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) specimen, as this is typical for TURP procedures.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and only mentions "ordinary prostate tissue" and "atrophied glands," so this is classified as non-malignant.
3. Gleason: Since no cancer is identified, the Gleason score is "NA" (Not Applicable).
