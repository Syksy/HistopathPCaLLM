Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples" and refers to "earlier biopsies", suggesting this is also a biopsy specimen.
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" and only describes benign findings in the current sample.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since no malignancy is reported in the current sample, no Gleason grade is applicable.
