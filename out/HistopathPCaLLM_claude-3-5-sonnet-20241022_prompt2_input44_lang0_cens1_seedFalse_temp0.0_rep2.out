Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified rules:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - This can be inferred from the mention of "prostate samples" and reference to "earlier biopsies"
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" and while there's a note about earlier cancer, the current sample shows no malignancy
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since no malignancy is reported in the current sample, no Gleason score is applicable
