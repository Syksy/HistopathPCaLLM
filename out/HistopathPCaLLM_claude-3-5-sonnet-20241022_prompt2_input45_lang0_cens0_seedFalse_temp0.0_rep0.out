{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy ("whole prostatectomy preparate")
2. Malignancy is present as tumor tissue is described
3. Gleason grading is mentioned as "classes 3+4", which represents Gleason score 3+4=7
