{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a prostatectomy ("whole prostatectomy preparate"), so "RP"
2. Malignant findings are present ("tumor tissue focus"), so "yes"
3. Gleason grade is mentioned as "classes 3+4", which translates to Gleason score "3+4=7"
