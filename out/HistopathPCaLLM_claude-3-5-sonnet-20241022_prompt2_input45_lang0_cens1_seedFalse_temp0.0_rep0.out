Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze it and structure the data according to the requirements:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy or RP, but it's unclear)
2. The statement is inconclusive regarding malignancy
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned

Therefore, the structured response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated
- While there is a "suspect" focus mentioned, the statement explicitly says "structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "further inspection is needed"
- No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text
- The statement is essentially inconclusive, requiring further examination
