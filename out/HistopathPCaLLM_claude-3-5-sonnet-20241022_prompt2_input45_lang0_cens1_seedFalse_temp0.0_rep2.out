Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement appears to be describing a prostate specimen, but it's unclear whether it's from a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. While there are suspicious findings, there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, and no Gleason grades are mentioned. The statement explicitly states that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and requires further inspection.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: Although it's a prostate sample, the specific type (biopsy/RP/TURP) is not explicitly stated
2. Malignancy: While there are suspicious findings, there's no definitive statement about malignancy
3. Gleason: No Gleason grades are mentioned in the text
