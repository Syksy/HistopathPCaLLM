Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The description mentions "shaved prostate chippings," which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material," indicating no malignancy.
3. Gleason: Since no cancer was found, the Gleason score is "NA" (Not Applicable).
