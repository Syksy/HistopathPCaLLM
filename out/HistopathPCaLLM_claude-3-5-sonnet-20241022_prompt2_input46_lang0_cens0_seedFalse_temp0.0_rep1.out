Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the description mentions "shaved prostate chippings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) procedure
2. Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign case with no cancer present
