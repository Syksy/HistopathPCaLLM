Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The description "shaved prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material," so this is clearly negative for malignancy.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign case with no cancer present, the Gleason score is "NA" (not applicable).
