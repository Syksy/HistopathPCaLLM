Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The statement doesn't clearly specify if this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: Since malignancy couldn't be determined and no Gleason grades are mentioned, "NA" is appropriate.
