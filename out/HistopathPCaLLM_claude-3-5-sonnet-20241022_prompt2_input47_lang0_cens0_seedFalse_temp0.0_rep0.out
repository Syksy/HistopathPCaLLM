{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data this way because:
1. The text clearly mentions "biopsies" as the sample type
2. The statement explicitly says "No malign findings"
3. While the text contains "3+4=7", this refers to the length of biopsies in centimeters, not Gleason grading. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA"
