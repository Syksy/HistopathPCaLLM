Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - This can be inferred from the description of examining material from right and left sides with specific amounts of prostatic material.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement explicitly says they are "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings."
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since malignancy couldn't be determined, there can't be a valid Gleason score.
