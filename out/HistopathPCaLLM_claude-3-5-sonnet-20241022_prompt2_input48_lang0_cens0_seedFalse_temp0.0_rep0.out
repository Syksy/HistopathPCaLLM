{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly a prostate resection ("RP")
2. Malignancy is present ("adenocarcinoma" found)
3. For Gleason grade, the statement mentions two foci:
   - First focus: Gleason 4 and 3
   - Second focus: Gleason 5 (>80%) and 4
   The summary explicitly states "Gleason 9 tumor", and since we should report the most severe lesion, and the second focus has higher grades (5+4), the final Gleason score is structured as "5+4=9"
