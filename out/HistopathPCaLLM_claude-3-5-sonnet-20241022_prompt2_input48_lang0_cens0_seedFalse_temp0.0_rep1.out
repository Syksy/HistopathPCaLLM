{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostate resection"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as adenocarcinoma was found
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9" based on:
   - The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with some Gleason 4
   - This is more severe than the first focus (4+3)
   - Summary confirms Gleason 9
   - We report the most severe lesion as instructed
