Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While the text mentions "prostate sample material," it's from multiple autopsies for educational purposes (URO-101 course). This doesn't fit into the standard categories of biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA" is appropriate.

2. Malignancy: The text doesn't explicitly state whether malignant findings were present. It only mentions "interesting patterns" and "histological changes" without specifying their nature, so "NA" is appropriate.

3. Gleason grade: The text explicitly states that differentiation scores (Gleason) are not derived due to the demonstrative nature of the samples, so "NA" is appropriate.
