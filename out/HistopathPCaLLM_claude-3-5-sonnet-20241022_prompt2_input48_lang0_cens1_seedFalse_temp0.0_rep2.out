Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: While prostate tissue is mentioned, it's from multiple autopsies for educational purposes (URO-101 course) and doesn't clearly fit into the allowed categories (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA" is appropriate.
2. Malignancy: The statement doesn't clearly indicate presence or absence of malignant findings. It only mentions "interesting patterns" and "histological changes" without specifying malignancy, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason: The statement explicitly mentions that differentiation scores (Gleason) are not derived, so "NA" is appropriate.
