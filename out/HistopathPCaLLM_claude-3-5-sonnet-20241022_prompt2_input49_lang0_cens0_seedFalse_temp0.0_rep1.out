{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. "Prostate chippings" and "shavings" indicate this is a TURP specimen
2. "5 shavings contained carcinoma" indicates malignancy is present
3. The Gleason grading is mentioned with "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4" which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
