Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (we can infer this from "prostate samples on 8 glasses" which typically refers to biopsy specimens)
- Malignancy: "NA" (while changes are mentioned, there is no clear statement about malignancy)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grade is mentioned in the text)
