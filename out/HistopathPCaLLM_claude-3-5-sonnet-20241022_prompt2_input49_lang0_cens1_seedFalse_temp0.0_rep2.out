Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: "biopsy" (we can infer this from "prostate samples on 8 glasses" which typically refers to biopsy slides)
- Malignancy: "NA" (while there are "changes that warrant further investigation," no definitive malignancy is reported)
- Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason grade is mentioned, and since malignancy is not confirmed, Gleason scoring would not be applicable)
