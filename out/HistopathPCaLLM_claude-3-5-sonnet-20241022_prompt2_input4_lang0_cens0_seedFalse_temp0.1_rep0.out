Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "prostate biopsies"
2. The statement explicitly indicates benign findings and absence of adenocarcinoma ("benign prostate tissue" and "do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma")
3. Since no malignancy is present, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA")
