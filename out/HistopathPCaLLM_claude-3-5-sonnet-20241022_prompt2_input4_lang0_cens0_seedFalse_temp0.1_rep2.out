Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text clearly states "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions that "samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" and describes the tissue as "benign"
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, no Gleason score is applicable
