Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text mentions "sampling sites" and "sample material" which indicates this is a biopsy specimen.
2. Malignancy: "NA" - The statement indicates that the material is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma, so no definitive statement about malignancy can be made.
3. Gleason: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
