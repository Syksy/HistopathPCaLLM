I'll analyze this histopathological statement and structure it according to the requested format.

From the text, we can determine:
1. This is a radical prostatectomy specimen ("radical prostatectomy")
2. There are malignant findings ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. For the Gleason grade, we should report the most severe finding. While there is a 4+3 pattern in macro A, macro B shows a more severe 4+5 pattern.

Here's the structured response in JSON format:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I've selected the highest Gleason score (4+5=9) as it represents the most severe lesion in the specimen, even though a lower grade (4+3) was also present in another location.
