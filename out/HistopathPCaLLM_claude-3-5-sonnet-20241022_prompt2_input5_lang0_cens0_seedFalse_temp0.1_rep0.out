I'll analyze this histopathological statement and structure it according to the requested fields:

1. This is clearly a radical prostatectomy specimen ("radical prostatectomy")
2. Malignant findings are present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. For Gleason grade, we should report the most severe finding. While there is a 4+3 pattern in macro A, macro B shows a more severe 4+5 pattern.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I selected these values because:
- The specimen is explicitly stated to be a radical prostatectomy
- Cancer is clearly present in the specimen
- Of the two Gleason patterns mentioned (4+3 and 4+5), I reported the more severe one (4+5=9) as requested in the instructions
