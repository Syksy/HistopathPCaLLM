I'll analyze this histopathological statement and structure it according to the requested fields:

1. This is clearly a radical prostatectomy specimen ("radical prostatectomy")
2. Malignant findings are present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. For Gleason grade, we should report the most severe finding. While there is a 4+3 pattern in macro A, macro B shows a more severe 4+5 pattern.

Here's the structured JSON response:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Note: When multiple Gleason scores are present in different locations, I've reported the highest/most severe score (4+5=9 rather than 4+3=7), as per the instruction to return results from the most severe lesion.
