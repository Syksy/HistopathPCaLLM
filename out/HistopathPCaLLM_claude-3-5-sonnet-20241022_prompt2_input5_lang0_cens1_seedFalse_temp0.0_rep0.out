Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it according to the requested structured fields:

1. Sample type: While the text discusses prostate tissue, it doesn't explicitly state whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen.

2. Malignancy: The text is ambiguous regarding definitive malignant findings. While it discusses Gleason grading, it states that grades "could not be inferred."

3. Gleason grade: The text explicitly states that Gleason grades could not be inferred.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This conservative interpretation is based on the lack of explicit information about sample type, no clear statement about malignancy, and the explicit statement that Gleason grades could not be determined.
