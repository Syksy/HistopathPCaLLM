Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it according to the requested structured fields:

1. Sample type: While the text mentions prostate tissue and samples, it doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. Malignancy: The text is ambiguous regarding malignancy. While it mentions Gleason grading being considered, it doesn't explicitly confirm malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: The text specifically states that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred."

Given these observations, the appropriate structured response would be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This structured response reflects the ambiguity and lack of explicit information in the source text regarding the sample type, clear malignancy status, and specific Gleason grades.
