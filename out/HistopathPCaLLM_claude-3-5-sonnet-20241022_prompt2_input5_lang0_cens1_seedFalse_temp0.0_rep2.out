Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it according to the requested structured fields:

1. Sample type: While the text mentions prostate tissue and samples, it doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. Malignancy: The text is ambiguous regarding malignancy. While it mentions Gleason grading being attempted, it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy.

3. Gleason grade: The text specifically states that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred."

Given these observations, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because the text lacks clear, explicit information about the sample type, doesn't definitively state whether malignancy is present, and explicitly states that Gleason grades could not be determined.
