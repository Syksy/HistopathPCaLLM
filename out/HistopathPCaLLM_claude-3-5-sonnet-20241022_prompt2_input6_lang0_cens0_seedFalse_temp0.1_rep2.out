Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The mention of "shaving chips" indicates this is a TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "normal prostate grandular structures" and "benign prostate hyperplasia" with no mention of malignancy, so this is clearly benign.
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding, Gleason score is not applicable ("NA").
