Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" and "fragmented parts," which is characteristic of TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) specimens.
2. Malignancy: Due to the heavy burn artifact and inconclusive results mentioned in the text, no definitive statement about malignancy can be made, hence "NA".
3. Gleason: Since no cancer is definitively diagnosed and results are inconclusive, Gleason score is "NA".
