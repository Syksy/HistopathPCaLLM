{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data this way because:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's marked as "NA"
2. The statement clearly indicates no definitive malignant findings ("no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the structures were "typically" expected), so Malignancy is "no"
3. Since there was no malignancy reported and no Gleason grades mentioned, Gleason is marked as "NA"
