Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data as follows:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP), so it's marked as "NA"
2. While there were "atypical structures," the statement explicitly mentions that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the rest was typical, indicating no clear malignancy, so it's marked as "no"
3. Since there was no malignancy reported and no Gleason grades mentioned, Gleason is marked as "NA"
