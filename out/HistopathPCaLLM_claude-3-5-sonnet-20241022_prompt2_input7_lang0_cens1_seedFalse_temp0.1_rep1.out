{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data this way because:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated (could be biopsy, TURP, or RP), so it's marked as "NA"
2. While there were "atypical structures," the statement concludes that no definite findings could be made and the rest was typical, indicating no malignancy was found
3. Since no malignancy was found, there can't be a Gleason score, so it's marked as "NA"
