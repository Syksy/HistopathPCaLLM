Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format.

Analysis:
- The text mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the exact type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- No definitive malignant findings are reported (only "atypical structures" that were inconclusive)
- No Gleason grade is mentioned

Therefore, the structured response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
