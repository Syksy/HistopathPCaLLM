Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is clearly stated as "radical prostatectomy preparate" (RP)
2. Malignancy is present as tumor tissue is described with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7"

The statement contains additional information about lymph nodes and other findings, but as per instructions, we focus on the most severe lesion, which is the prostate tumor with Gleason score 4+3=7.
