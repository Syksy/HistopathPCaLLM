{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as mentioned in sample 3
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumor tissue is described with invasive properties
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7"

The statement is a valid histopathological report containing clear information about the specimen type, malignant findings, and Gleason grading. Even though there are multiple findings described (including lymph nodes and PIN-changes), I reported only the most severe finding as instructed, which is the prostate tumor with Gleason 4+3=7.
