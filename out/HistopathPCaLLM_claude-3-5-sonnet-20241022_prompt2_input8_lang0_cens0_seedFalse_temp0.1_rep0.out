{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly "RP" (radical prostatectomy is mentioned in sample 3)
2. Malignancy is "yes" (tumor tissue is described with invasive properties)
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7" in the text

The statement is a valid histopathological report, and the most severe lesion is described with a Gleason score of 4+3=7, which is reported in the structured format as requested.
