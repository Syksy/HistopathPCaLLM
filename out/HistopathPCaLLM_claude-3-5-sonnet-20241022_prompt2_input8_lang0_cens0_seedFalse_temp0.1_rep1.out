{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly "RP" (radical prostatectomy is mentioned in sample 3)
2. Malignancy is "yes" (tumor tissue is described with invasive properties)
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7"

The statement is a valid histopathological report containing clear information about a radical prostatectomy specimen with malignant findings and specific Gleason grading.
