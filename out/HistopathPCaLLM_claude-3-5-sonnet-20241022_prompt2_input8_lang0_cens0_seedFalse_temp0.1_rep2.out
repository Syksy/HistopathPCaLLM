{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is clearly "RP" (radical prostatectomy is mentioned in sample 3)
2. Malignancy is "yes" (tumor tissue is described with invasive properties)
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as "4+3=7"

The statement is a valid histopathological report containing clear information about the prostate specimen and its findings. Although there are also lymph node findings mentioned, the prostate findings represent the most severe lesion and therefore determine the structured output.
