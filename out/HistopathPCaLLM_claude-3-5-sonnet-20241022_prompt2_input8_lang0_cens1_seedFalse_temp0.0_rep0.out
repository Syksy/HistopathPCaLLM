Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement appears to discuss multiple tissue samples but lacks clear indication of sample type, has unclear malignancy status in sample 3 (though samples 1 and 2 are benign), and explicitly states that Gleason patterns are missing/unreported.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP, but not specified)
2. Malignancy status is mixed/unclear (samples 1 & 2 are benign, sample 3 is uncertain)
3. Gleason grade is explicitly stated as missing with "empty fields ? and ?"

Given the ambiguity and missing critical information, the most appropriate response is to mark all fields as "NA".
