Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement appears to discuss multiple tissue samples but lacks clear indication of the sample type. While it mentions prostate tissue, there's no explicit mention of whether these are biopsy, RP, or TURP samples. The statement indicates no clear malignancy (mentions only PIN-changes and normal inflammation) and no specific Gleason grades (mentions that they are "missing" with "empty fields"). Therefore:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
- Sampletype: While prostate tissue is mentioned, the specific type of sampling procedure isn't clearly stated, hence "NA"
- Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions samples 1 and 2 are "free of malignant findings" and for sample 3 only mentions PIN-changes and inflammation, so "no"
- Gleason: The statement specifically mentions that Gleason patterns are "missing" with empty fields, hence "NA"
