Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields. The statement appears to discuss multiple tissue samples but lacks clear indication of sample type, has no definitive malignancy confirmation, and no specific Gleason grades are reported (only mentions empty fields for Gleason patterns). Therefore:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly stated (whether biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. While some samples are mentioned as free of malignancy, the overall malignancy status is unclear
3. Gleason grades are mentioned but no specific values are provided (fields are described as empty with "?")
