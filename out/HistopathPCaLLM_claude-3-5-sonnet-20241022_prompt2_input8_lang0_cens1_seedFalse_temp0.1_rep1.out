Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: The description mentions multiple samples with indices and discusses tissue examination, which is most consistent with biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy: While there are discussions of various findings and PIN-changes, the statement explicitly mentions that samples were "completely free of malignant findings."
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy was found and the statement mentions that Gleason patterns were missing with empty fields, this should be "NA".
