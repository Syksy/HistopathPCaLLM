Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data according to the specified fields:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sampletype: "biopsy" - The text describes multiple samples/segments being examined, which is typical for biopsy specimens.
2. Malignancy: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions that samples were "completely free of malignant findings."
3. Gleason: "NA" - While the text discusses Gleason patterns, no specific grades are reported (described as "empty fields"), and since the samples were benign, "NA" is the appropriate value.
