Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The description mentions "electrosection shavings" which is characteristic of TURP (Trans-Urethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings are observed"
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding (no malignancy), the Gleason score is "NA"
