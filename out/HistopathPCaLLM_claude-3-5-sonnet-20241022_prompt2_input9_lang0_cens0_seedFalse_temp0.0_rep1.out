{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

I structured the data based on the following analysis:
1. Sample type is "TURP" because the description mentions "electrosection shavings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).
2. Malignancy is "no" as the statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings are observed"
3. Gleason score is "NA" because this is a benign case (no malignancy), and Gleason scoring is only applicable for malignant cases.
