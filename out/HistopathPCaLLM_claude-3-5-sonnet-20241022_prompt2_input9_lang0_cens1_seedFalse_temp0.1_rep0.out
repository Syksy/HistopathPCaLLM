Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format. The statement describes a processing of tissue samples but does not clearly specify:
1. The sample type (no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Any definitive malignant findings (only mentions "normal" epithelial cell lining)
3. Any Gleason grade (no mention of cancer or Gleason scoring)

Therefore, the appropriate JSON structure would be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This is because the statement primarily discusses sample processing and technical issues, without providing the specific diagnostic information required for more detailed classification.
