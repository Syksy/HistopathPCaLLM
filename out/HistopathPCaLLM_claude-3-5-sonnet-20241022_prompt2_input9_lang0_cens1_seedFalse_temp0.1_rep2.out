Based on the provided text, I'll analyze it according to the requested structure:

1. The text mentions prostate tissue examination but does not clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP).
2. No malignant findings are explicitly mentioned; the text only describes normal epithelial cell lining and some processing issues.
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned as there are no malignant findings reported.

Therefore, the structured JSON response should be:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

This interpretation is based on:
- Sample type is unclear from the text
- The findings describe normal epithelial cells without mention of malignancy
- No Gleason grade is applicable as no cancer was reported
