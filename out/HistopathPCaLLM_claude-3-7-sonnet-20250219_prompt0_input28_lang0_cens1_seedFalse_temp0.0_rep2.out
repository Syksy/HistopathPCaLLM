Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a biopsy examination of six different sites of the prostate. While there are mentions of "atypical growth patterns," "odd growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperlastic changes," there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. The findings are described as warranting "further inspection" and some material is being sent for further evaluation. Without a clear diagnosis of malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported.
