Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The text mentions "sections from the left/right", "apex and basis" samples, and processing of the entire prostate, which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignant tumor findings: The text is unclear about whether malignancy was definitively found. It mentions "suspected higher sum" and refers to a colleague for further inspection, but doesn't clearly state if cancer was present, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason grade: The text explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred," so "NA" is the appropriate value.
