I'll analyze the histopathological statement and extract the structured data according to the specified fields.

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The description mentions "sections from the left/right", "apex and basis" samples, and "prostate capsule", which are terms typically used in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, not biopsies or TURP.
2. Malignant findings: The statement is unclear about whether malignancy was definitively found. It mentions "suspected higher sum" and refers to Gleason classes, but doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy, so I've marked it as "NA".
3. Gleason grade: Although Gleason grading is mentioned, no specific grades are provided. The text states "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred", so I've marked it as "NA".
