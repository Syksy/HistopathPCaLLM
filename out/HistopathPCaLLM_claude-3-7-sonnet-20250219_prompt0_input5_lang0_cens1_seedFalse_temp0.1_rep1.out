Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the requested fields:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The description of "relatively enlargened prostate" with sections from both apex and basis being processed suggests this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignant findings: The statement is unclear about whether malignancy was definitively found. It mentions "suspected higher sum" and refers to a colleague for further inspection, but doesn't clearly state if cancer was present, so "NA" is appropriate.
3. Gleason grade: The text explicitly states "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," so "NA" is the appropriate value.
