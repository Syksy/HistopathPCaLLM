Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "chipping samples" which is consistent with TURP procedure. The statement clearly indicates "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia," so malignancy is "no". Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
