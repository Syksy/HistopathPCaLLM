Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement indicates that prostate tissue was examined, but the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified. The pathologist states that no inference about malignancy can be conducted from the sample, and no Gleason grade is mentioned as no malignancy was identified or confirmed.
