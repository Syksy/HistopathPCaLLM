Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes issues with sample logistics and staining procedures, but does not provide clear information about the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP), does not indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present, and does not mention any Gleason grading. The text only mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" but doesn't specifically identify malignancy or provide grading information.
