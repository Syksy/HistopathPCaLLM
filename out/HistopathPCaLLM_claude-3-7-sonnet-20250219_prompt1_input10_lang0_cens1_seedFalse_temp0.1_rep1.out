Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes issues with sample logistics and staining procedures but does not clearly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), does not mention any malignant findings, and does not provide any Gleason grading information. The text only mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" related to staining failures, but no definitive cancer diagnosis or grading.
