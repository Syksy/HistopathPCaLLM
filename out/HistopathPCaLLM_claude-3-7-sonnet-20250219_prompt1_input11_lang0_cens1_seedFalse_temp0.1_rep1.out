Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue examination but doesn't clearly specify:
1. The sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Whether malignancy was definitively found
3. While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, they are referenced as "could not be reliably assessed" and no final Gleason sum is provided

Therefore, I've marked all fields as "NA" due to insufficient information in the provided statement.
