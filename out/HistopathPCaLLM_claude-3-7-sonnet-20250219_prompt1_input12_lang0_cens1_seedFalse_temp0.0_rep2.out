Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue" which indicates malignancy is present, but it doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) or provide any Gleason grade information. The statement only mentions that the sample has been started in eight batches and is awaiting high resolution images in the digipathology queue.
