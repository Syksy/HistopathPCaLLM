Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue" which indicates malignancy is present, but it doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Additionally, no Gleason grade information is provided in the text. The sample is described as being "started in eight batches" but this doesn't clearly indicate the sample type.
