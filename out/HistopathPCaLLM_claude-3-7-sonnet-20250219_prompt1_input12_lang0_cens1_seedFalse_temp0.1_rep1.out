Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue" which indicates malignancy is present, but it doesn't specify the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP). Additionally, there is no mention of Gleason grades in the statement. The histological examination is still in progress with high resolution images in the digipathology queue.
