Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The statement describes prostate needle biopsies (sample type), identifies carcinoma in sample B (malignancy present), and specifies the Gleason score as 4+5=9 (the most severe lesion reported).
