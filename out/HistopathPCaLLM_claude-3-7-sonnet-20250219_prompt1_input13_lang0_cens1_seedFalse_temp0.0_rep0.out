Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate samples that appear to be from a biopsy procedure (multiple samples from different locations). There is mention of "some irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B that requires further inspection, but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy is provided. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text. The statement indicates that further verification is needed, suggesting that a final diagnosis has not been made.
