Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate samples that appear to be from a biopsy procedure (multiple samples from different locations). However, while there are "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" mentioned in sample B that warrant further inspection, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy provided. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text. Therefore, I've marked the malignancy status and Gleason grade as "NA" (not available) since these cannot be determined from the given information.
