Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate samples that appear to be from a biopsy procedure (multiple samples from different locations). However, while there are "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" mentioned in sample B that warrant further inspection, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy provided. The text doesn't mention adenocarcinoma or any specific Gleason grading. Since a consultation is needed for verification, the malignancy status remains undetermined, and consequently, no Gleason score is available.
