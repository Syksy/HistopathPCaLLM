Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is a "prostatetectomy preparate" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. Malignancy is "yes" as tumorous growth is observed.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Since the larger portion is score 3 (60%), this indicates a 3+4=7 Gleason score.
