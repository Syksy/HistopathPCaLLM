Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: The text mentions a "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. The statement confirms malignancy with "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Although the exact Gleason pattern breakdown isn't explicitly stated as "3+4", the text mentions "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%", which indicates a primary pattern of 3 and secondary pattern of 4, making it a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
