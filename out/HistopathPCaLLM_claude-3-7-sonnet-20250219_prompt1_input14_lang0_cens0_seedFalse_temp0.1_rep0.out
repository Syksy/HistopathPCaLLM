Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: The statement mentions a "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. It clearly states there is a tumor present ("tumorous growth is observed"), confirming malignancy. The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%", which indicates a Gleason 3+4=7 (since the predominant pattern is 3, making up 60% of the tumor).
