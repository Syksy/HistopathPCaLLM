Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: The statement mentions a "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. It clearly states malignancy with "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" and specifies that the larger portion is score 3 (approximately 60%), which means the Gleason pattern is 3+4=7.
