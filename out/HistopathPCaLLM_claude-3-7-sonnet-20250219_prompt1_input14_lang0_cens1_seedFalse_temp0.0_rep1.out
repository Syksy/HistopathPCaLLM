Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text discusses a prostate tissue specimen being processed and examined, but it does not clearly specify whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). While there is mention of "special patterns of cell growth" and a reference to a "Gleason 7 score patient," these are not definitive statements about the current specimen's malignancy status or Gleason grade. The text indicates that further investigation is needed before making any conclusive statements.
