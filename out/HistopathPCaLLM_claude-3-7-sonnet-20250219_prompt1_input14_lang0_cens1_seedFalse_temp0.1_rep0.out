Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text discusses a prostate tissue specimen being processed and examined, but it does not clearly specify whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). While there is mention of a "Gleason 7 score patient" in comparison, this is referring to a different patient and not a definitive finding for the current specimen. The text indicates that further investigation is needed before making any conclusive statements, so the malignancy status and Gleason grade for this specific specimen cannot be determined from the provided information.
