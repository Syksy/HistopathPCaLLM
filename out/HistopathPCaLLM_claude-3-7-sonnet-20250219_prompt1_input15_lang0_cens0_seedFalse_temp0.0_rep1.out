Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings" which is the typical description for material obtained through TURP procedure. The statement confirms adenocarcinoma throughout the sample, making the malignancy "yes". For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8", which indicates a Gleason score of 4+4=8.
