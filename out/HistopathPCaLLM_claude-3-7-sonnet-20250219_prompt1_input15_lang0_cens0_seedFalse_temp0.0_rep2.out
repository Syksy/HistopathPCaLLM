Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings" which is typical terminology for this procedure.

Malignancy is confirmed as "yes" since the statement explicitly mentions "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material."

For the Gleason grade, the statement indicates a Gleason sum of 8, with Gleason 4 being the most represented pattern. Since Gleason 4 is the predominant pattern and the sum is 8, I've structured it as "4+4=8".
