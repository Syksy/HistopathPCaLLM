Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the description of "prostate chippings" which is characteristic of this procedure. The statement confirms adenocarcinoma throughout the sample, indicating malignancy. For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8," which I've interpreted as 4+4=8 since Gleason 4 is described as the predominant pattern.
