Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a very meager prostate tissue sample that was processed with high priority. While there is mention of clinical suspicion of adenocarcinoma with a possible Gleason sum of 8 or above, the pathologist explicitly states that no representative Gleason could be determined from this sample. The findings are inconclusive and require further examination to confirm or rule out malignancy. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" since definitive information is not available from this histopathological examination.
