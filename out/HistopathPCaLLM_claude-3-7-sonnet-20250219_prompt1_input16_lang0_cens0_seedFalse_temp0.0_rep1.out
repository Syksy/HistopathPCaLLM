Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes fusion biopsies from the prostate with carcinoma findings. The Gleason score is 7, with grade 3 being predominant (covering approximately 2/3 of the carcinoma) and grade 4 being secondary (covering approximately 1/3), which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
