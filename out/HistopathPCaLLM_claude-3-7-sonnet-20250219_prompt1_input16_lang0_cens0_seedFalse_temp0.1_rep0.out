Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes fusion biopsies from the prostate with carcinoma findings. The Gleason score is mentioned as 7, with architecture 3 covering approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covering approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma, which translates to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7.
