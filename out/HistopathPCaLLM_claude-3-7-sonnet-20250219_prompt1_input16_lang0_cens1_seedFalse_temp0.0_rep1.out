Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes multiple suspicious foci from the prostate that were examined, but it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. It mentions various grades of cell differentiation but states that explicit scoring is inconclusive due to resolution issues. The text suggests that proper grading should be done manually rather than from digital images. Since no definitive Gleason grade is provided and malignancy isn't clearly confirmed, I've marked these fields as "NA".
