Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes multiple suspicious foci from the prostate that were examined, but it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. It mentions various grades of cell differentiation but states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. The sample type appears to be a biopsy (multiple suspicious foci from the prostate), but since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy or specific Gleason grading provided, I've marked both Malignancy and Gleason as "NA".
