Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Note: I determined "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as the sample type since the text refers to a "prostatectomy preparate" with detailed sectioning. The Gleason score is derived from the statement that the "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" is present, indicating a 4+3=7 pattern where grade 4 is predominant.
