Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure."
2. Malignancy is "yes" as the text mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as sum 7, with stage 3 representing the larger fraction (60%). Since the larger component is grade 3, and the total is 7, this indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
