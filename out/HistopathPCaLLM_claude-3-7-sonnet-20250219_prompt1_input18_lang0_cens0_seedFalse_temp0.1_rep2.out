Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure"
- Malignancy is "yes" as the text mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma"
- The Gleason grade is reported as sum 7, with the larger fraction being stage 3 (60% of tumor area), which means the primary pattern is 3 and secondary pattern is 4, resulting in "3+4=7"
