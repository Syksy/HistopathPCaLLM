Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "standard prostate related procedures" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so I've assigned "NA".
2. Malignancy: While there is a suspicious focus that "might contain" material of ISUP GG 1 or above, it's described as too small to properly assign a grade group, and >95% of the material appears benign. Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, I've assigned "no".
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is definitively reported and no specific Gleason grades are mentioned, I've assigned "NA".
