Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't specify whether these are biopsies, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) samples. The results are described as "inconclusive" regarding malignancy, and no specific Gleason grade is mentioned. The statement indicates that "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings," confirming that these determinations have not been made.
