Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't specify whether these are biopsies, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens. The findings are described as "inconclusive" with "additional inspection required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings," indicating that no definitive determination of malignancy or Gleason grade was made.
