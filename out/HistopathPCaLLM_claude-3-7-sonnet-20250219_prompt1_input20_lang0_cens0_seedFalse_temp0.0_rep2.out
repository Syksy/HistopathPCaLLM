Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Note: I've selected "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as the sample type since the text mentions a "prostatectomy resection". For the Gleason grade, I've reported "4+4=8" as it represents the most severe lesion mentioned (from the basis), which takes precedence over the less severe "3+4" finding at the apex.
