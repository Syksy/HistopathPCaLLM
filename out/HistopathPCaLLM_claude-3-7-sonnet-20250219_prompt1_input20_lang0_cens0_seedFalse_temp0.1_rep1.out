Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

I've determined these values because:
1. The sample type is a prostatectomy resection, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy is present as adenocarcinoma is detected in both apex and basis
3. For the Gleason grade, I've reported the most severe finding, which is "4+4" from the basis (as instructed to return results from the most severe lesion)
