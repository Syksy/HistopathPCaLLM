I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and extract the structured data according to the specified fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate tissue samples that have been obtained and examined, but due to the patient's history of multiple pelvic diseases and interventions, the assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is reported as impossible. While there is a hypothetical mention of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)", this is not an actual finding but rather a speculative example. No definitive malignancy is reported, and no confirmed Gleason score is provided.
