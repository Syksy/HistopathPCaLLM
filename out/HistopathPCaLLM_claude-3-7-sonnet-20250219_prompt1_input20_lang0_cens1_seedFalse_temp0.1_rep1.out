I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and extract the structured data according to your requirements.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement indicates that prostate tissue samples were obtained and examined, suggesting a biopsy procedure. However, due to previous treatments in the pelvic region affecting cell morphology, examination for adenocarcinoma was deemed impossible. No definitive malignancy determination was made, and while a hypothetical Gleason score of "3+4" is mentioned, this was not actually observed or diagnosed in the patient. Therefore, both the malignancy status and Gleason score are marked as "NA".
