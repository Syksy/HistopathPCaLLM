I'll analyze this prostate histopathology statement and extract the structured data according to your requirements.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a case where prostate tissue samples were obtained, suggesting a biopsy procedure, but examination for adenocarcinoma was deemed impossible due to prior therapies affecting the cell morphology. No definitive malignancy is reported, and while a hypothetical Gleason score of "3+4" is mentioned, it's not an actual finding for this patient. Therefore, I've marked the malignancy status and Gleason grade as "NA" (not available/applicable).
