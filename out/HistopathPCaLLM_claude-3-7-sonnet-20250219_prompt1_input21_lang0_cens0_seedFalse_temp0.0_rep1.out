Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which are terms typically used for TURP specimens.

Malignancy is present as indicated by the description of "poorly differentiated growth," "tumor-like tissue," and Gleason grading.

The Gleason grade is reported as 5 for the most common pattern and 4 for the second most common pattern, resulting in a sum of 9.
