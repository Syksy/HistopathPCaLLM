Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which are terms typically used for TURP specimens.

Malignancy is "yes" as the statement describes tumor-like tissue with poorly differentiated growth, enlarged nuclei, and Gleason grading.

The Gleason grade is structured as "5+4=9" because the statement indicates the most common Gleason grade is 5 and the second most common is 4, which would be reported as 5+4=9 in the standard Gleason scoring system.
