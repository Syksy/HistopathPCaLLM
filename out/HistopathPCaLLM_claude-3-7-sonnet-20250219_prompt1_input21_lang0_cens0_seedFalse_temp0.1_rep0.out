Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The analysis shows:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings" and "shavings"
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as evidenced by tumor-like tissue and Gleason grading
3. Gleason grade is "5+4=9" based on the most severe lesion, with 5 being the most common pattern and 4 being the second most common pattern
