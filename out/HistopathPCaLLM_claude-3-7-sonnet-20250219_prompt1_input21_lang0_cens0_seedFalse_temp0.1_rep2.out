Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The analysis shows:
1. Sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "prostate chippings" and "shavings"
2. Malignancy is present ("yes") as evidenced by the tumor-like tissue and Gleason grading
3. The Gleason grade is reported with the most common grade as 5 and second most common as 4, making the structured Gleason score "5+4=9"
