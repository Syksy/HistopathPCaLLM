Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type appears to be a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) based on the description of "extracted prostate material" in "fragments" with a weight measurement (3/5g). The malignancy status cannot be determined due to poor sample quality ("nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise confounds assessment", "too noisy material"). Similarly, no Gleason grade can be assigned due to these quality issues, and the report indicates the material will be revisited after quality control.
