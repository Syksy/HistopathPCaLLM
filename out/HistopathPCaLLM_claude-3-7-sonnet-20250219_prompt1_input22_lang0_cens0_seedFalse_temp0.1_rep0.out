Based on the provided prostate histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The analysis shows:
- The sample is clearly a prostate thick needle biopsy
- Malignancy is present in the left side fragments (carcinoma tissue)
- The Gleason grading mentions score 3 as the primary pattern ("mainly") and score 4 as the secondary pattern, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
