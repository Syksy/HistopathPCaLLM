Based on the provided prostate histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

I've determined this structure because:
1. The sample type is clearly a "thick needle biopsy" of the prostate
2. Malignancy is present as "carcinoma tissue structures" are found in the left side fragments
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which indicates a Gleason pattern of 3+4=7 (primary pattern 3, secondary pattern 4)
