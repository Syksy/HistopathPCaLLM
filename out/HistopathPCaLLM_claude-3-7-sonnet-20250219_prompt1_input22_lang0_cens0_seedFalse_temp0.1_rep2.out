Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The analysis shows:
1. Sample type is clearly a prostate thick needle biopsy
2. Malignancy is present (carcinoma tissue structures on the left side)
3. Gleason grade is reported as "mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4" which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7
