Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue sampling material that was fragmented, which indicates a biopsy procedure. However, due to issues with the sample quality (fragmentation, wide range of cell differentiation types, possible contamination), the pathologist was unable to assess for malignancies and recommended reprocessing the samples. Therefore, both the malignancy status and Gleason grade are marked as "NA" (not available).
