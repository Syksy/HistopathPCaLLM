Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement discusses a sample that needs to be reprocessed, with mention of a prior report suggesting potential Gleason 3 findings in the apex. However, the current statement doesn't confirm any malignancy findings, doesn't clearly identify the sample type, and doesn't provide a definitive Gleason grade. The text indicates that further investigation is needed to validate initial suspicions.
