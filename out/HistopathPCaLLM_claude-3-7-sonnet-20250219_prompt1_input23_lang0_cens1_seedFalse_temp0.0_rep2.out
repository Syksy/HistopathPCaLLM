Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement discusses a sample that needs to be reprocessed, with mention of a prior report suggesting potential Gleason 3 findings in the apex. However, the current report doesn't confirm malignancy or provide a definitive Gleason grade. The sample type is also not clearly specified (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP). Therefore, I've marked all fields as "NA" since definitive information is not available in this particular statement.
