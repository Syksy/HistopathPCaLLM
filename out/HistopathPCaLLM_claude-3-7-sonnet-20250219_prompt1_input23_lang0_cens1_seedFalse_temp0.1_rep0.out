Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions a prior report with "potential Gleason 3 findings" in the apex, but this appears to be a preliminary finding that requires validation. The current report is inconclusive and recommends reprocessing the sample with focus on the apex. The sample type is not clearly specified, and there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy or final Gleason grade in this particular report.
