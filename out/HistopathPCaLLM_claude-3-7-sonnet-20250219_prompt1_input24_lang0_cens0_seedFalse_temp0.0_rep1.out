Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The sample type is clearly TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) as indicated by "turp-chippings". The statement confirms malignancy with "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and specifically mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" in the summary. While the statement doesn't explicitly list both Gleason grades, the mention of Gleason 4 and a sum of 8 indicates a 4+4=8 pattern.
