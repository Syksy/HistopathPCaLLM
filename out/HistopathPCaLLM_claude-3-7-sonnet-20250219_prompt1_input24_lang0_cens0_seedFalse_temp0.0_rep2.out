Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The sample is described as "turp-chippings" which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. The statement confirms malignancy with "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" in the summary. While the statement doesn't explicitly list both Gleason grades, the sum of 8 with mention of Gleason 4 pattern suggests a 4+4=8 grade.
