I've analyzed the prostate cancer histopathological statement and structured the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The statement describes TURP-chippings (transurethral resection of the prostate) with Gleason 4 tumor growth that resulted in a sum of 8 adenocarcinoma. While the statement doesn't explicitly mention the minor grade, the total Gleason sum of 8 with a major grade of 4 implies a 4+4=8 pattern.
