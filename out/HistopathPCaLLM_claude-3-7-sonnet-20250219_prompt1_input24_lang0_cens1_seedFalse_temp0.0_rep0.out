Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

The text mentions multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings), but biopsies are mentioned first, so I've selected "biopsy" as the sample type. The text indicates that some previously benign diagnoses were upgraded to Gleason scores, confirming malignancy in some cases. The most severe lesion mentioned is Gleason 3+3=6, as the text specifically states "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" but then mentions "resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6" in the summary, suggesting 3+3=6 as the confirmed finding.
