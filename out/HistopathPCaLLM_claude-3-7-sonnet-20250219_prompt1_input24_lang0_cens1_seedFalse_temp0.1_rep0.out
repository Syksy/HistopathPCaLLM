Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

The text mentions multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings), but biopsies are mentioned first, so I've selected that as the primary sample type. The text indicates that some previously benign diagnoses were upgraded to malignant findings (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4), confirming malignancy. For the Gleason grade, I've selected 3+3=6 as it's specifically mentioned as an upgrade from benign material ("upgraded to either Gleason 3+3").
