Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

The text mentions multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings), but biopsies are mentioned first and appear to be the primary sample type discussed. There were malignant findings in some cases, as indicated by the upgrading from benign to Gleason scores. The most severe lesion mentioned is Gleason 3+3=6, as the text specifically states "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" but then mentions "resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6" in the summary, suggesting this was the confirmed finding.
