Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: I determined "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as the sample type since the text mentions a "prostatectomy preparate." The statement clearly indicates malignancy with a "widely spread tumor." For the Gleason grade, the text states that "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent," which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
