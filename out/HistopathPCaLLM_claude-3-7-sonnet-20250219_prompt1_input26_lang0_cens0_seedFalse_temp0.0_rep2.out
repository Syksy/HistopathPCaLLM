Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Notes on my analysis:
- The sample type is a "prostatectomy preparate" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
- Malignancy is clearly present as the text describes a "widely spread tumor"
- For Gleason grade, the text states "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent" which indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7 (with 3 being the primary/dominant pattern and 4 being the secondary pattern)
