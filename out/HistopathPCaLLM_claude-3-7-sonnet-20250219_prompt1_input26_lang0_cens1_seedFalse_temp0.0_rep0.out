Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue samples (marked A-C for apex and D-F for basis), which suggests a biopsy procedure, but the sample type isn't explicitly stated. The malignancy status is unclear as the text mentions difficulty in assessment due to recent radiation therapy. While there is a reference to a possible "Gleason sum 7" in clinical notes, it's described as unverified and unclear whether it's GG 2 or 3, so the Gleason grade cannot be definitively determined from this report.
