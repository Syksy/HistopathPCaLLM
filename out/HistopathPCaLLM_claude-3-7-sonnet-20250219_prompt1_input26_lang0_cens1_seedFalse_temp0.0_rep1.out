Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue samples (marked A-C for apex and D-F for basis), which suggests a biopsy procedure, but the sample type isn't explicitly stated. The malignancy status is unclear as the text mentions difficulty in assessment due to recent radiation therapy. While a "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, it's described as unverified and possibly either GG 2 or 3, with the pathologist unable to confirm due to post-radiation changes. Therefore, I've marked both the malignancy status and Gleason grade as "NA" since definitive information cannot be determined from the provided text.
