Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions prostate tissue samples but doesn't clearly specify if they are from biopsy, RP, or TURP. It references a possible "Gleason sum 7" from clinical notes, but states this is unclear and cannot be verified due to recent radiation therapy affecting the tissue assessment. The text doesn't definitively confirm malignancy in the current samples being examined, only referring to previous clinical notes.
