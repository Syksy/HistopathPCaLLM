Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+NA=NA"
}
```

Note: I've determined this structure based on the following analysis:
- The sample type appears to be a biopsy (tissue samples processed in batches)
- There is mention of possible tumor presence ("Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities"), so I've marked malignancy as "yes"
- The Gleason score is only partially reported (only mentions score 3 in small quantities), and since it's described as "debatable" and doesn't provide a complete Gleason pattern, I've included the available information but marked the minor grade and sum as "NA"
