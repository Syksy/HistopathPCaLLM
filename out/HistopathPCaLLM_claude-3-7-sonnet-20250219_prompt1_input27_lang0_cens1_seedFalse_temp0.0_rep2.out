Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+NA=NA"
}
```

Note: I've determined this structure because:
1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy (tissue samples processed in batches)
2. There is mention of possible Gleason score 3 in small quantities, suggesting malignancy
3. The Gleason grade is incomplete - only a possible score of 3 is mentioned without a secondary pattern or sum, so I've included what's available but marked the missing components as NA
