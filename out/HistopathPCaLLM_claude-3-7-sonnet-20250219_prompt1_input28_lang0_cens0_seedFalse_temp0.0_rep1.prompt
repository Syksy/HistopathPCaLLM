Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Examination consists of six biopsy cylinders that had been taken due to elevated PSA. Focus #1 on the front of left side exhibits 5mm length of poorly differentiated atypical grandular structure. This appears to be adenocarcinoma, with Gleason classification 4+4=8. Focus #2 on the middle of the left side also exhibits 10mm length of adenocarcinoma tissue, with Gleason point sum 4+3=7 and grade 4 proportion approx 80%. Focus 3# on the middle section on the right side also contains a finding with grades 4 and 3 with proportions approx. 70:30%, thus sum 7 (3+4). In the rest of the samples mostly hyperplastic changes are seen in the epithelial cells. As a summary, the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8.
