Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. Sample type: The text describes a prostate specimen with weight and multiple sections (A-F), which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. Malignancy: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" indicating malignancy.
3. Gleason: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (though there appears to be a typo in the original text as it mentions grade 4 twice). The summary states "Score sum 7 finding". Based on the description that grade 4 is the predominant pattern, this would be a 4+3=7 Gleason score.
