Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of a "fresh sample specimen" with weight and multiple sections taken from different parts of the prostate.
- Malignancy is present as "invasive adenocarcinoma" is observed.
- For Gleason grade, the text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (there appears to be a typo in the original text, likely meant to be grade 3 for the smaller portion). The summary explicitly states "Score sum 7 finding". Based on the description that grade 4 is predominant, this would be a 4+3=7 Gleason score.
