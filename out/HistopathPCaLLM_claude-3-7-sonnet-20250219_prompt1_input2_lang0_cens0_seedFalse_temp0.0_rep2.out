Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample is described as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The text indicates only benign findings with "normal benign growth," "some atrophy and spot-like inflammation," and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia," but no mention of malignancy. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA" (not applicable).
