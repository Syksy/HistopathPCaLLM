Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample is described as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). The text indicates only benign findings with "normal benign growth," some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no mention of malignancy. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Applicable).
