Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes an autopsy specimen for research use, but doesn't specifically identify it as a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate). The statement mentions potential adenocarcinoma but doesn't confirm malignancy, stating "further inspection and sample re-runs are required." No Gleason grade is reported in the text.
