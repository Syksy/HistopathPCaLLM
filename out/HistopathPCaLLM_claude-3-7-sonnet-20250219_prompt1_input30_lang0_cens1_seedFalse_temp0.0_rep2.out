Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a consultation about uncertain findings, but doesn't specify the sample type, doesn't confirm malignancy (only mentions "atypical findings" that could not be confirmed or denied), and doesn't mention any Gleason grade. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient information.
