Based on the provided text, I need to extract structured data about a prostate cancer histopathological statement. However, the text doesn't contain specific information about sample type, clear malignancy confirmation, or Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "samples were taken" and "suspicious findings" but doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), doesn't clearly confirm malignancy (only mentions "suspicious findings"), and doesn't mention any Gleason grading information.
