Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. However, the text does not contain clear information about sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "original primary prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It also mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being "clear" but doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue. No Gleason grade information is provided in the text.
