Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. However, the text does not contain clear information about the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "original primary prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It also mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, but doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue. No Gleason grade information is provided in the text.
