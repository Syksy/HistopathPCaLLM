Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), mentions no malignant findings in seminal vesicles but is unclear about other tissues, and provides no Gleason grade information. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy in the prostate tissue itself, I've marked malignancy as "no" and used "NA" for the unspecified fields.
