Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), mentions "no malignant findings in seminal vehicles" but is unclear about malignancy in the prostate itself, and doesn't mention any Gleason grade. Therefore, I've used the appropriate "NA" values where information is not available.
