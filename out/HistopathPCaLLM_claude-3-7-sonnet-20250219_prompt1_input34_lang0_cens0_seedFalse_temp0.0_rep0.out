Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample is described as a "resection weighing 7.5gr", which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities", so the sample is benign. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
