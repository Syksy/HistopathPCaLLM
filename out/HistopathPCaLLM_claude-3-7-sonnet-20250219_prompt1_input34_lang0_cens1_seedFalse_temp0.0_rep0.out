Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sample with hyperplastic changes and chronic inflammation, but does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). There is no evidence of malignancy mentioned - in fact, it specifically states "Findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer]" and only mentions hyperplastic tissue with inflammation. Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable.
