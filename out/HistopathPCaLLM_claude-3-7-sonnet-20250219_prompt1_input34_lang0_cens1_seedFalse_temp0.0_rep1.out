Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sample with hyperplastic changes and chronic inflammation, but does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). There is no mention of malignancy - in fact, it explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer]" and describes hyperplastic tissue with inflammation, which are benign conditions. Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable.
