Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sample with hyperplastic changes and chronic inflammation, but does not specify whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. There is no mention of malignancy (in fact, it states "findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer]"), and consequently no Gleason grade is reported.
