Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is inferred as "biopsy" since it mentions samples from left and right lobe, which is typical for prostate biopsies. The statement only mentions PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes and hyperplasia, which are non-malignant findings. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant tumor, and consequently no Gleason grade is reported.
