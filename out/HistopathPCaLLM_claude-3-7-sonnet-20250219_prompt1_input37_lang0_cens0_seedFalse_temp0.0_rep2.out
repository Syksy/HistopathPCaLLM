Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the description of "electrosection chippings." The statement indicates only hyperplasia with minor inflammation, with no mention of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "no". Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA".
