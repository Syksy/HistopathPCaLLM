Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies from both the right and left sides with no malignant findings, so I've marked "Malignancy" as "no" and "Gleason" as "NA" since there is no Gleason grading for benign samples. The "3+4=7 cm" in the text refers to the total length of the biopsies, not a Gleason score.
