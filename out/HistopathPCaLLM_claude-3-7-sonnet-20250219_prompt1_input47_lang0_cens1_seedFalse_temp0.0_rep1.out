Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type appears to be a biopsy based on the description of examining material from right and left sides with specific measurements. The statement indicates uncertainty about malignancy ("Not able to determine whether there is malign findings"), so I've marked it as "NA". Since there is no mention of Gleason grading and no confirmed malignancy, Gleason is also marked as "NA".
