Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type appears to be a biopsy based on the description of examining material from right and left sides with specific measurements. The statement explicitly mentions that they were "not able to determine whether there is malign findings," so malignancy is marked as "NA". Since there's no malignancy confirmed, there is no Gleason grade reported, so it's also marked as "NA".
