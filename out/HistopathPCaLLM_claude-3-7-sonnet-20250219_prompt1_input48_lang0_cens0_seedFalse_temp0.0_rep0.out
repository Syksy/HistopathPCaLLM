Based on the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

I determined this structure because:
1. The sample is a "prostate resection" which corresponds to RP (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy is present as "adenocarcinoma" is found
3. For the Gleason grade, I used the most severe lesion mentioned, which is the "Gleason 9 tumor" with the second focus having "Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4" - making the Gleason score 5+4=9
