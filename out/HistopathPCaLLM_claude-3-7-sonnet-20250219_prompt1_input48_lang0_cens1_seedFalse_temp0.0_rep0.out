Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes educational/demonstration material from multiple autopsies used for a course (URO-101). While it mentions "interesting patterns" and "histological changes," it explicitly states that this is not used to derive Gleason scores. The sample type is unclear (appears to be autopsy material but not specifically biopsy, RP, or TURP), and malignancy is not definitively stated. The text specifically mentions that Gleason scoring was not performed.
