Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate sample material from autopsies being used for educational purposes (URO-101 course). The sample appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles being placed separately. While "some interesting findings" and "exemplifying histological changes" are mentioned, there is no clear statement about malignancy. The text explicitly states that Gleason scoring was not performed ("not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)").
