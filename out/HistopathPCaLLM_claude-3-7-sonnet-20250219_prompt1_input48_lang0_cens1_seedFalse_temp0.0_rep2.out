Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate sample material from autopsies being used for educational purposes (URO-101 course). The sample type appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles being placed separately. There is no clear indication of malignancy, and the text explicitly states that Gleason scoring was not performed ("not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)").
