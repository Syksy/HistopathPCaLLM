Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" which suggests this is a biopsy sample. However, there is no clear indication of malignancy - only "some changes that warrant further investigation" without a definitive diagnosis. Since no malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned, both fields are marked as "NA".
