Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies (samples 1-6) that are representative (except for sample 3) and show benign prostate tissue with no adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
