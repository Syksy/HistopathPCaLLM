Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies that show benign prostate tissue with no evidence of adenocarcinoma, so I've marked the malignancy as "no" and the Gleason grade as "NA" since there is no cancer present to grade.
