Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies that are representative (except for sample 3) and show benign prostate tissue with no adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy", there are no malignant findings, and since there's no cancer, the Gleason grade is "NA".
