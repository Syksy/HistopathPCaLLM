Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies that show benign prostate tissue with no evidence of adenocarcinoma, so I've indicated the sample type as "biopsy", malignancy as "no", and Gleason grade as "NA" since there is no malignancy reported.
