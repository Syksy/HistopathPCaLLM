Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate biopsy (implied by "several sampling sites" from "standard locations"), but notes that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma. Therefore, malignancy cannot be determined and is marked as "NA". Since no malignancy could be confirmed or ruled out, there is no Gleason grade to report, so it's also marked as "NA".
