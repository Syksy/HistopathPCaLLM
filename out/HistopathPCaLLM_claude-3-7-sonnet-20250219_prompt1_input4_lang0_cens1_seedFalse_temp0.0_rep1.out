Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate tissue sample that appears to be from a biopsy (multiple sampling sites from standard locations). The pathologist notes that the sample is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma, so malignancy cannot be determined ("NA"). Since no malignancy is confirmed, there is no Gleason grade to report ("NA").
