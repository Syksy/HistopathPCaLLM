Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate biopsy (implied by "several sampling sites" from "standard locations"), but indicates that the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for the presence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, malignancy cannot be determined and is marked as "NA". Since no malignancy could be confirmed or ruled out, the Gleason grade is also "NA".
