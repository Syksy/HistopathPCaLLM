Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

I've extracted the most severe lesion as requested, which is in macro B with Gleason 4+5=9, rather than the less severe finding in macro A (4+3=7). The sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as clearly stated in the first sentence.
