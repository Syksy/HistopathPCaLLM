Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

I've extracted this information because:
1. The sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. Malignancy is present ("cancerous tissue is observed")
3. For the Gleason grade, I've reported the most severe finding, which is in macro B with "architecture 4+5" and "sum (9)"
