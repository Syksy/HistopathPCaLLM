Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate specimen with sections from different areas, but it doesn't clearly specify whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Additionally, there is no definitive statement about malignancy findings, and no specific Gleason grades are reported. The text mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred" and refers to a "suspected higher sum" for further inspection, but doesn't provide actual Gleason values.
