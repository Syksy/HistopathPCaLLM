Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostatectomy specimen (indicated by mentions of apex, basis, and prostate capsule which suggests a radical prostatectomy), but it doesn't clearly state whether malignancy was found. While there is mention of Gleason classes, the text specifically states they "could not be inferred." The report appears to be inconclusive regarding malignancy and Gleason grading, hence the "NA" values for these fields.
