Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostatectomy specimen (indicated by mentions of apex, basis, and prostate capsule, which suggests a radical prostatectomy), but doesn't clearly state whether malignancy was found. While there's mention of Gleason classes, the text states they "could not be inferred" and refers to a colleague for further inspection. Therefore, I've marked both Malignancy and Gleason as "NA" due to insufficient clear information in the provided text.
