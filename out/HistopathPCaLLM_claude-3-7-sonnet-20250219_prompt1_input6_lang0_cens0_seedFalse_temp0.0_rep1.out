Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" because the description mentions "shaving chips" which is characteristic of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The statement indicates benign findings (benign prostate hyperplasia) with no mention of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "no". Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA".
