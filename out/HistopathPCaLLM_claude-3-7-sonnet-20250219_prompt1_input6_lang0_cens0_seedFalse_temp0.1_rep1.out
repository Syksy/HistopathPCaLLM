Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the description of "shaving chips" which is characteristic of this procedure. The statement indicates benign findings (benign prostate hyperplasia) with no mention of malignancy. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA".
