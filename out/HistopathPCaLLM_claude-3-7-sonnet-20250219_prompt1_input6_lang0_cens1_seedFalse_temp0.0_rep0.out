Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. However, due to heavy burn artifact and fragmentation, the pathologist was unable to properly assess the tissue for malignancy, making the results inconclusive. Therefore, malignancy status is marked as "NA" and consequently, no Gleason grade could be determined, also marked as "NA".
