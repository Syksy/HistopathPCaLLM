Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. However, due to heavy burn artifact and fragmentation, the pathologist was unable to make a conclusive determination about malignancy, and consequently no Gleason grade could be assigned. Therefore, both the malignancy status and Gleason grade are marked as "NA" (not available).
