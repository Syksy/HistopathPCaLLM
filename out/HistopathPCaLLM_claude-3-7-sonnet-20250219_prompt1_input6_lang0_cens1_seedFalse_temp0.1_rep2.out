Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the mention of "prostatic operation material." The malignancy status is marked as "NA" because the statement indicates the results are "inconclusive" due to heavy burn artifact affecting the majority of the sample. Since no malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grading is mentioned, the Gleason field is also marked as "NA".
