Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate biopsies where there is only a suspicion of adenocarcinoma in one sample, but no conclusive finding was made ("the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet"). Since no definitive malignancy was diagnosed and no Gleason grade was assigned, I've marked malignancy as "no" and Gleason as "NA".
