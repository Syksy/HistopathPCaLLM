Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as mentioned in sample 3. Malignancy is "yes" as tumor tissue with invasive properties is observed. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7", which represents the most severe lesion identified in the specimen.
