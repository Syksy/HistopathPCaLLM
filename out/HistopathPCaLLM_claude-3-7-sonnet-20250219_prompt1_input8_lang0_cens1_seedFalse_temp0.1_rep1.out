Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes multiple samples (indices 1, 2, and 3) that appear to be biopsies. While there are discussions about histological properties and potential PIN-changes in sample 3, there is no clear statement confirming malignancy. The Gleason patterns are mentioned as missing with "empty fields" for major and minor grades. Samples 1 and 2 are explicitly stated to be free of malignant findings, but the overall malignancy status remains unclear, hence "NA". Similarly, no specific Gleason grade is reported (described as a "recording mishap"), so "NA" is appropriate for that field as well.
