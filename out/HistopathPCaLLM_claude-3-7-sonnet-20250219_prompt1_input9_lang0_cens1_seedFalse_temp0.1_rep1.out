Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes examination of prostate tissue but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure. The findings indicate normal epithelial cell lining with some disproportionate glandular structures attributed to technical difficulties in processing. No malignancy is reported, and consequently, no Gleason grade is mentioned. The report suggests inconclusive results due to suspected faulty processing of the sample.
