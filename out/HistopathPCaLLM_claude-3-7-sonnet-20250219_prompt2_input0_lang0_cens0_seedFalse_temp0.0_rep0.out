Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "chipping samples" which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia," confirming the absence of malignancy. Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable.
