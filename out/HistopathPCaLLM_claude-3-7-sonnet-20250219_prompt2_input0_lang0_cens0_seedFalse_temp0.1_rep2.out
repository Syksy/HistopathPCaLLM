Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "chipping samples" which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" indicating no malignancy was found. Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report, so it's marked as "NA".
