Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "sample material" which suggests a biopsy. While it doesn't explicitly state "biopsy," the context of examining prostate tissue from obtained samples aligns with a biopsy procedure. The report clearly states that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and only mentions "spot-like inflammation," indicating no malignant findings were observed. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
