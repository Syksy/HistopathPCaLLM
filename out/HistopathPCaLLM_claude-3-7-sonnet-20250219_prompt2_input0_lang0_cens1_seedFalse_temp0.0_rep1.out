Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "sample material" which suggests a biopsy. While it doesn't explicitly state "biopsy," the context of examining prostate tissue from obtained samples indicates this is the most appropriate classification. The statement clearly indicates that no malignancy was detected ("any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted"). Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
