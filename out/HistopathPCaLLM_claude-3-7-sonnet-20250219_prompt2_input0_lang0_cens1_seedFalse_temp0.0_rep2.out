Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions prostate tissue was examined, but doesn't specify whether it was from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It explicitly states that no inference of malignancy or carcinoma can be conducted, indicating no malignant findings were observed. Since there was no malignancy detected, there is no Gleason grade to report.
