Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate tissue sample but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It explicitly states that no malignancy can be determined ("any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted"). Since there is no malignancy identified, there is no Gleason grade to report.
