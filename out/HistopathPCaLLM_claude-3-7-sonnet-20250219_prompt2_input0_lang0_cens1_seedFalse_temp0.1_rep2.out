Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement indicates that prostate tissue was examined, but there is no clear indication of the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). The report explicitly states that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and only mentions "spot-like inflammation" with no reliable conclusions possible. Since no malignancy was detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
