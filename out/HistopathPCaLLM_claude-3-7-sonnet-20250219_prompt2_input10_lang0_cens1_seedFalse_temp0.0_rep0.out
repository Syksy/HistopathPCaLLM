Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine that:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified (it mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify if they are biopsies, RP, or TURP).
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings (only mentions "suspicious formations" but doesn't confirm malignancy).
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.

Therefore, the structured JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
