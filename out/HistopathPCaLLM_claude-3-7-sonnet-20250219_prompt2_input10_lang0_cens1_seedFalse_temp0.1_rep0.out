Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.

The text primarily discusses issues with sample logistics and staining procedures, but does not provide the specific histopathological information needed for the structured fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
