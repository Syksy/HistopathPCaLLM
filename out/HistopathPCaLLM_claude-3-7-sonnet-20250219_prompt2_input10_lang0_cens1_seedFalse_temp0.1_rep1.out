Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It only mentions "prostate samples" without specifying the collection method.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "suspicious formations" but does not confirm malignancy.
3. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.

Therefore, the structured JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
