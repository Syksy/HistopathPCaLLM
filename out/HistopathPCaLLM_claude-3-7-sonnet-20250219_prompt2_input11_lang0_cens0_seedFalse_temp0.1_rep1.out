Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy), with clear evidence of malignancy ("invasive tumor tissue is observed"), and a Gleason grade of 4+3, which would sum to 7 though the sum is not explicitly stated in the original text.
