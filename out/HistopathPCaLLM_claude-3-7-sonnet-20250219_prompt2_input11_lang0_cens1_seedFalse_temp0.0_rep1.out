Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a microscopic examination of prostate tissue, but it doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample. While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text states they "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material. There is no definitive statement about the presence of malignancy, and no final Gleason grade is reported in the format of "major+minor=sum". The text mainly describes an inconclusive examination with limited material.
