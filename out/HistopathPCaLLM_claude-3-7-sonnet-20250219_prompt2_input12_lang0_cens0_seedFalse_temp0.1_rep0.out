Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "electrosection shavings from the prostate" which corresponds to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. The tissue is explicitly described as "benign" with "normal prostate tissue like architecture," so there is no malignancy. Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported, thus it is marked as "NA".
