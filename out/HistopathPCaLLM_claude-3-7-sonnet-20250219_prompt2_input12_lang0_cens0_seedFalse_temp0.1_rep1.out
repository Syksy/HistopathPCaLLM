Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "electrosection shavings from the prostate," which corresponds to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The tissue is explicitly described as "benign" with "normal prostate tissue like architecture," indicating no malignancy was found. Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable, so it's marked as "NA".
