Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue" which indicates malignancy is present, but it doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Additionally, no Gleason grade information is provided in the statement. The sample is confirmed to be prostate tissue with cancer, but the specific sample type and grading details are not available.
