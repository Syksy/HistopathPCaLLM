Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue" which indicates malignancy is present, but it doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Additionally, no Gleason grade information is provided in the statement. The sample is described as prostate cancer tissue, but the specific sample type is not clearly stated.
