Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate samples that were taken from typical locations, with some irregularities noted in sample B that require further inspection. However, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy or mention of Gleason grading. The sample type appears to be a biopsy based on the description of samples taken from different locations of the prostate.
