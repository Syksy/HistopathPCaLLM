Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate samples that appear to be biopsies (samples taken from different locations in the prostate). While there are "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" mentioned in sample B that warrant further inspection, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy provided. No Gleason grading is mentioned in the text. The statement indicates that further verification is needed, suggesting that a final diagnosis has not been made.
