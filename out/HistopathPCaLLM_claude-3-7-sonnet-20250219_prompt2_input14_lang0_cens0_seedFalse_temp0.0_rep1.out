Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is a prostatectomy (RP - Radical Prostatectomy)
- Malignancy is present as "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" are mentioned
- The Gleason score is 7, with the larger portion (60%) being score 3, which indicates a 3+4=7 pattern (where the primary/most prevalent pattern is 3)
