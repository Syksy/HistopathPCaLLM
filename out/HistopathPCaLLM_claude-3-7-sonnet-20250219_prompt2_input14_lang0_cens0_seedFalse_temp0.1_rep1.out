Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is a "prostatetectomy preparate" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. Malignancy is present as indicated by "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 7, with the statement indicating that the larger portion (60%) is score 3, which implies a 3+4=7 Gleason grade (where the primary/major pattern is 3 and the secondary/minor pattern is 4).
