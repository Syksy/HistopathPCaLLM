Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

The text mentions a prostate tissue specimen and refers to a "Gleason 7 score patient" in a comparative context, but does not directly state findings about the current specimen. The text is discussing the processing of samples and suggesting further investigation before making definitive statements. There is no clear indication of the sample type, confirmation of malignancy in this specific specimen, or a definitive Gleason grade for this patient.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
