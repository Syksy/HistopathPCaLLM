Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a process of examining prostate tissue samples and mentions discussions about the case, but it does not clearly specify:
1. The original sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Whether malignant tumor findings were definitively present
3. A specific Gleason grade for the current patient (only mentions a comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient")

The text indicates that further investigation is needed before making definitive statements, so the appropriate values for all three fields are "NA".
