Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

The text discusses a prostate tissue specimen being processed and examined, but it doesn't clearly specify the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy, or TURP). There is mention of a "Gleason 7 score patient" in comparison, but this is referring to a different patient, not the current specimen being analyzed. The text indicates that further investigation is needed before making any definitive statements about the current specimen.

Therefore, the structured data is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
