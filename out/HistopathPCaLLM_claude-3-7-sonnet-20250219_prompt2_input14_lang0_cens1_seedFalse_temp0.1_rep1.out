Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

The text mentions a prostate tissue specimen and refers to a "Gleason 7 score patient" in a comparative context, but does not directly state findings about the current specimen. The text suggests further investigation is needed before making a definitive statement. The sample type is not clearly specified (biopsy, RP, or TURP), and there is no clear statement about malignancy or a specific Gleason grade for this particular specimen.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
