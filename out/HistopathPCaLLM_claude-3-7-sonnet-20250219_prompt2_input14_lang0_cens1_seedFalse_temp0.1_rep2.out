Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

1. The text mentions prostate tissue and samples, but does not clearly specify whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

2. There is no clear statement about malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references a "Gleason 7 score patient" for comparison, but does not explicitly state that this patient has cancer.

3. While a Gleason 7 score is mentioned, it is in reference to a different patient, not the current case being described.

Therefore, the structured JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
