Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The statement describes "prostate chippings" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) procedure. It confirms adenocarcinoma (malignancy) throughout the sample. For the Gleason grade, it mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8," which indicates a Gleason score of 4+4=8.
