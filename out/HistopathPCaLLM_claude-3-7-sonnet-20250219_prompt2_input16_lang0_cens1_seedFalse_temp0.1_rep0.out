The statement discusses examining prostate tissue samples, but it doesn't clearly specify whether these are from biopsy, RP, or TURP. It mentions "suspicious foci" but doesn't definitively confirm malignancy. While it references grading challenges and mentions potential Gleason patterns (3+4 or 4+3), it doesn't actually assign a specific Gleason score to the sample. The statement primarily discusses technical difficulties with digital histopathology assessment rather than providing a conclusive diagnosis.
