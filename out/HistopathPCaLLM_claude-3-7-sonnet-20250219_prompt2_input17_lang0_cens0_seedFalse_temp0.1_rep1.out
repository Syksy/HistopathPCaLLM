Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is a prostatectomy (RP - Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "Prostatectomy preparate" in the text.
- Malignancy is present ("yes") as evidenced by multiple tumor foci, Gleason grading, perineural invasion, and capsular penetration.
- The Gleason grade is reported as predominantly grade 4 with some grade 3. Since grade 4 is described as "most dominant" with "some grade 3", the appropriate Gleason score would be 4+3=7.
