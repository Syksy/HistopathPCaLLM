Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is a prostatectomy (RP - Radical Prostatectomy) as indicated by "Prostatectomy preparate is processed..."
- Malignancy is present as indicated by "Multiple clear foci emerge" and descriptions of tumor infiltration
- The Gleason grade is structured as 4+3=7 because the statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" (with grade 4 being the dominant/major pattern)
