Based on the provided text, I can see that this is not a valid histopathological statement with clear diagnostic conclusions. The text appears to be a procedural note about sample preparation and mentions that assessment will be performed later by resident candidates, with results to be appended to this "preliminary report." There is no definitive diagnosis, malignancy determination, or final Gleason score reported.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
