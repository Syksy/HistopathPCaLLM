Based on the provided text, I can determine that this is not a valid histopathological statement with conclusive findings. The text appears to be a preliminary report describing the processing of prostate samples, but it does not provide definitive diagnostic information about malignancy or specific Gleason scores. It mentions that assessment of Gleason differentiation will be performed later and appended to this preliminary report.

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Note: While the text does mention prostate tissue samples that appear to be from a biopsy procedure (samples A-O from different regions of the prostate), there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy or specific Gleason score provided in this preliminary report.
