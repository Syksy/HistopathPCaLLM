Based on the provided text, I can determine that this is not a valid histopathological statement with conclusive findings. The text appears to be a preliminary report describing the processing of prostate samples, but it does not provide definitive diagnostic information about malignancy or specific Gleason scores. It mentions that assessment of Gleason differentiation will be performed later as part of a training exercise for residents, with results to be appended to this preliminary report.
