Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) as indicated by "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure"
- Malignancy is present ("a small fraction appears to be carcinoma")
- The Gleason score is reported as sum 7, with the larger fraction being stage 3 representing 60% of the tumor area. Since the larger component is pattern 3 (60%), and the total sum is 7, the Gleason grade would be 4+3=7.
