Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes targeted prostate biopsies, with sample 4 containing adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%), which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7. The most severe lesion is in sample 4, which is what I've reported in the structured data.
