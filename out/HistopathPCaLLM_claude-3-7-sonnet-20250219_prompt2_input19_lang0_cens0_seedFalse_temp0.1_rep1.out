Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes targeted prostate biopsies, with sample 4 containing adenocarcinoma with Gleason patterns 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). Since pattern 3 is the predominant pattern (90%) and pattern 4 is the secondary pattern (10%), the Gleason score is structured as 3+4=7.
