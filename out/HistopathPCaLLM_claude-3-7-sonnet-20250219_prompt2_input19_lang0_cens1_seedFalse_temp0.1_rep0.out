Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement appears to describe prostate tissue samples, likely biopsies (cylinders are mentioned), but there is no definitive malignancy diagnosis. Sample 4 shows potential abnormalities but requires verification before a final diagnosis can be made. No Gleason grading is provided in the statement.
