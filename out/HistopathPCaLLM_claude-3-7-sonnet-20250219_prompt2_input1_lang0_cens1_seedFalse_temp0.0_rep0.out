Based on the provided statement, I cannot determine the sample type, confirm malignancy, or identify a Gleason grade. The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples" but doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). It states that results are "inconclusive" regarding malignancy and potential Gleason findings. Therefore, I'll structure the data as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
