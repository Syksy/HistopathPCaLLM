Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

I've determined this structure because:
1. The sample type is a "prostatectomy resection" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy is present as "adenocarcinoma" is mentioned
3. For the Gleason grade, I've reported "4+4=8" as it represents the most severe lesion found (in the basis), which takes precedence over the "3+4" found in the apex
