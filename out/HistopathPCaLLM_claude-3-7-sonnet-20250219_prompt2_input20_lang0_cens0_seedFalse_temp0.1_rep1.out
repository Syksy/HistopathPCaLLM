Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

I've determined this structure because:
1. The sample is described as a "prostatectomy resection" which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
2. Malignancy is present as indicated by "adenocarcinoma" findings
3. For the Gleason grade, I've reported "4+4=8" as this represents the most severe lesion mentioned (from the basis), following the instruction to return only results from the most severe lesion.
