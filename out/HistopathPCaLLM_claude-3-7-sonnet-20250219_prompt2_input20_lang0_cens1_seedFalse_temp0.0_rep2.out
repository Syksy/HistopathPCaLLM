Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue samples that have been obtained (suggesting a biopsy), but explicitly states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." While there is a hypothetical mention of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," this is not an actual finding but rather a speculative example. The malignancy status cannot be determined from this report, and no definitive Gleason score is provided.
