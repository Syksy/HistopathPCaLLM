Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue samples that have been obtained, suggesting a biopsy procedure. However, it explicitly states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." There is no definitive statement about malignancy findings, and while a hypothetical Gleason score (3+4) is mentioned, it's not an actual finding but rather a speculative example. Therefore, both the malignancy status and Gleason grade are marked as "NA".
