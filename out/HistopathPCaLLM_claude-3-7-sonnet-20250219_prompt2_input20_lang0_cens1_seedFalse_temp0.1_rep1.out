After analyzing the provided text, I can structure the data as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate tissue samples that have been obtained, indicating a biopsy procedure. However, the statement explicitly mentions that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." There is no definitive confirmation of malignancy, and while a hypothetical Gleason score of "3+4" is mentioned, it's presented only as a theoretical example, not an actual finding. Therefore, both the malignancy status and Gleason score are marked as "NA" since no conclusive determination could be made from the provided tissue samples.
