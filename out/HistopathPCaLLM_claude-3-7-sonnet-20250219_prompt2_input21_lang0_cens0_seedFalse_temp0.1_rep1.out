Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The statement describes prostate chippings (shavings), which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text clearly indicates malignant findings with descriptions of "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue." The Gleason grading is mentioned as most common being 5 and second most common being 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9.
