Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes extracted prostate material in fragments weighing 3/5g, which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. However, the statement indicates that the quality of the sample is poor with dissolved nuclei and technical noise that prevents proper assessment. No definitive malignancy determination is made, and consequently, no Gleason grade is reported. The pathologist indicates that quality control issues need to be addressed before the material can be properly evaluated.
