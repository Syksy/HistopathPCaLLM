Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes prostate thick needle biopsies (sample type is "biopsy"), with malignant findings on the left side fragments showing carcinoma tissue structures (malignancy is "yes"). The Gleason grading is described as "mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7.
