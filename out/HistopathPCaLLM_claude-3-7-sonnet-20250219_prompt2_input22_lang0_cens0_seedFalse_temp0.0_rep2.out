Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes prostate thick needle biopsies (sample type is "biopsy"), with malignant findings on the left side fragments ("Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures"), and the Gleason grades mentioned are 3 (primary) and 4 (secondary), which gives a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
