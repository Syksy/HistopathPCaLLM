Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate tissue sampling material with fragmentation, which indicates a biopsy sample. However, the pathologist states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed" due to issues with the sample quality, fragmentation, and possible contamination. Therefore, malignancy status and Gleason grade are both marked as "NA" since they could not be determined from the provided samples.
