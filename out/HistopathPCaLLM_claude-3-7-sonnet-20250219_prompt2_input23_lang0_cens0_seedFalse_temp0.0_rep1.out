Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The statement describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy) containing adenocarcinoma. The tumor is malignant with a predominant Gleason grade 4 (60%) and secondary grade 5 (30%), resulting in a Gleason score sum of 9 as explicitly stated in the conclusion. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but is described as "diminishingly small" and not included in the final score.
