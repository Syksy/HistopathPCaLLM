Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The statement describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy) containing adenocarcinoma. The tumor has a predominant Gleason grade 4 (60%) and secondary grade 5 (30%), with a tertiary grade 3 that is "diminishingly small". The conclusion explicitly states a Gleason score sum of 9, which corresponds to the combination of the two most prevalent grades (4+5=9).
