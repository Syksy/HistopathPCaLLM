Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The statement describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy) containing adenocarcinoma. The tumor is malignant with a predominant Gleason grade 4 (60%) and secondary grade 5 (30%), resulting in a Gleason score of 9. Although a tertiary grade 3 is mentioned, it's described as "diminishingly small" and according to the instructions, only the most severe lesion should be reported, which is represented by the 4+5=9 Gleason score.
