Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The statement describes TURP-chippings (transurethral resection of the prostate) being examined, with malignant findings of adenocarcinoma. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and later summarized as "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Since both components appear to be Gleason 4, I've structured it as "4+4=8".
