Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The statement describes TURP-chippings (transurethral resection of the prostate) with Gleason 4 tumor growth that was re-evaluated as "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." While the statement doesn't explicitly list both Gleason grades, it mentions Gleason 4 and a sum of 8, which implies a 4+4=8 pattern.
