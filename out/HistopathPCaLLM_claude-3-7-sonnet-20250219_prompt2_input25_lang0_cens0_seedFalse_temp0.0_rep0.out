Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement describes multiple biopsy samples with prostate adenocarcinoma present in samples (1) and (2). The most severe lesion appears to be in sample (1) where Gleason pattern 4 is 20% and pattern 3 is 30%, making it a Gleason 4+3=7 (with pattern 4 being the primary component despite lower percentage, as it's the more aggressive pattern).
