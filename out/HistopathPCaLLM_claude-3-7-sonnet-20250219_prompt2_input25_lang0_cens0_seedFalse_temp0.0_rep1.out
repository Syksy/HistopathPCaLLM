Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement describes multiple tissue cylinders/cores, which indicates this is a prostate biopsy. Adenocarcinoma is present as confirmed in the conclusion. For the Gleason grade, I've determined 4+3=7 as the most severe lesion based on the percentages provided (Gleason 4 pattern is the primary component in the samples where cancer was found).
