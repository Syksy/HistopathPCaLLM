Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes multiple tissue samples that appear to be from a biopsy procedure. However, the pathologist indicates that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified due to issues with the samples. There is no definitive malignancy finding reported, and consequently no Gleason grade is provided.
