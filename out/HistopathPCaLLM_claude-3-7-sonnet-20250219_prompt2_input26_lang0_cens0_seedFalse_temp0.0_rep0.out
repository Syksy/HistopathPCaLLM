Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The reasoning for this structured data:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as indicated by "prostatectomy preparate"
2. Malignancy is "yes" as the statement clearly describes a tumor
3. Gleason grade is derived from "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent" - this indicates a 3+4 pattern, which equals a sum of 7
