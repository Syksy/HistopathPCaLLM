Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions prostate tissue samples, but doesn't clearly specify if they are from biopsy, RP, or TURP. It references a possible "Gleason sum 7" from clinical notes, but states this is unclear and not verified. Due to recent radiation therapy, the histopathology cannot be properly assessed. There is no definitive confirmation of malignancy in the current samples being examined. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient clear information.
