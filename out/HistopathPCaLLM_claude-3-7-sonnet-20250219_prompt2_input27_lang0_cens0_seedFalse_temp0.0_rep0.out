Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" because the statement mentions "shavings" which is consistent with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The statement confirms malignancy with "Carcinoma was histologically detected" and clearly states the Gleason grade as "3+3=6".
