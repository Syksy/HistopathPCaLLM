Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

The statement describes "shavings" which indicates a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. It clearly states that carcinoma was detected, confirming malignancy. The Gleason grade is explicitly reported as 3+3=6.
