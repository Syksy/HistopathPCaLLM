Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions prostatic tissue material but doesn't clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). It mentions possible Gleason score 3 in small quantities but uses uncertain language ("debatably", "could maybe") and doesn't provide a complete Gleason grade in the required format. There's no definitive statement about malignancy. Given these ambiguities, the appropriate response is to mark all fields as "NA".
