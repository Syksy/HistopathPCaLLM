Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

I've extracted the most severe lesion as requested, which is focus #1 with Gleason 4+4=8, as also confirmed in the summary statement "the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8."
