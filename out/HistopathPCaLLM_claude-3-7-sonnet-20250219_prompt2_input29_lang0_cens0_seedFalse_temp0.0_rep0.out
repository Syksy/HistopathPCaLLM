Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type appears to be a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of a complete prostate specimen with weight and systematic sampling from different regions.
- Malignancy is clearly present as "invasive adenocarcinoma" is mentioned.
- For Gleason grade, the text states "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (there appears to be a typo in the original text, likely meant to say grade 3 for the smaller portion). The summary confirms "Score sum 7" and based on the description of predominantly grade 4, this would be structured as 4+3=7.
