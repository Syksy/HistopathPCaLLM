Based on the provided text, I'll structure the prostate cancer histopathological statement:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. Sample type: The text describes a "fresh sample specimen" of a prostate with weight and multiple sections taken from different areas, which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP) procedure.
2. Malignancy: The statement clearly mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" with capsular penetration and perineural invasion, indicating malignancy.
3. Gleason grade: The text states "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (there appears to be a typo in the original text, likely meant to say grade 3 for the smaller portion). The summary mentions "Score sum 7" which confirms the Gleason sum. Since grade 4 is described as the predominant pattern, the Gleason score is 4+3=7.
