Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sampling procedure that appears to be a biopsy (multiple samples taken from different regions of the prostate). However, there is no clear statement about malignancy findings, and the text explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible," indicating that no Gleason score could be determined. Some samples (A and C) contained non-prostatic tissue and need to be re-examined.
