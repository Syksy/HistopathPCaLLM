Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy), shows no evidence of malignancy (only benign growth, atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia are mentioned), and therefore has no Gleason grade to report.
