Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample is described as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The text clearly indicates benign findings with phrases like "normal benign growth" and no mention of malignancy or cancer. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
