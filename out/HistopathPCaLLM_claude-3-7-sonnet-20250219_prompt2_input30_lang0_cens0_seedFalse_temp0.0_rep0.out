Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the mention of "chippings" which is terminology typically used for TURP specimens.

The statement confirms malignancy with "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" and specifically mentions Grade Group 3, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 4+3=7.

The statement indicates that the most severe lesion shows a primary pattern of grade 4 and a secondary pattern of grade 3, with a tertiary pattern of grade 5. According to standard reporting guidelines, the Gleason score is derived from the two most predominant patterns, which in this case is 4+3=7.
