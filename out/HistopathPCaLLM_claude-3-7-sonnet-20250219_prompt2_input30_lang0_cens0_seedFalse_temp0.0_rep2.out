Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" based on the mention of "chippings" which is terminology typically used for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens.

Malignancy is "yes" as the statement confirms a diagnosis of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" after consultation.

The Gleason grade is "4+3=7" as indicated by "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3" which corresponds to a Gleason score of 4+3=7 (Grade Group 3).
