Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The statement describes targeted biopsies, with the most severe lesion being a large focus with primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, which would give a Gleason score of 4+5=9. This represents the most aggressive tumor characteristics found, superseding the earlier Gleason 3+3=6 finding.
