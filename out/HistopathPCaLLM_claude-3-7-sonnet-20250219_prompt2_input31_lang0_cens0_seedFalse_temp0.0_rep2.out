Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data according to the specified fields:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

The text describes multiple biopsies, but I've focused on the most severe lesion as instructed, which is from the second targeted biopsy showing a large focus with primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5.
