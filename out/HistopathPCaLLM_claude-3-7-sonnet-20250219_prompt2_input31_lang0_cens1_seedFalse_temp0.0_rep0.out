Based on the provided text, I cannot identify a clear histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The text mentions "suspicious findings" and "samples" but does not specifically mention prostate tissue, adenocarcinoma, or Gleason grading. There is no clear indication of the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP), no definitive statement about malignancy, and no Gleason grade information.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
