Based on the provided text, I cannot identify a clear histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The text mentions "suspicious findings" but does not specifically mention prostate cancer, adenocarcinoma, or provide any Gleason grading information. The sample type is also not clearly specified (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP).

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
