Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The provided statement does not clearly indicate the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP), does not explicitly state whether malignant tumor findings were present, and does not mention any Gleason grade. The text only provides general information about samples being in different batches, their lengths, and that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, but lacks the specific information required for the structured fields.
