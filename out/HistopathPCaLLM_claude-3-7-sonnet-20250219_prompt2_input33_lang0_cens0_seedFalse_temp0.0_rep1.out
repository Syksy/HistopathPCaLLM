Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

I've determined these values because:
1. The sample type is a "Radical prostatectomy" (RP)
2. There are malignant findings as indicated by the tumor description
3. For the Gleason grade, the statement mentions "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3". Since I need to report the most severe lesion, I've selected "4+3=7" as this represents the higher grade.
