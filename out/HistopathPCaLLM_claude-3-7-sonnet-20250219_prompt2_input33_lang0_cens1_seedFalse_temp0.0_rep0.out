Based on the provided statement, I cannot determine specific details about the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade. The statement is vague and does not provide clear information about prostate cancer histopathology. It mentions "processed samples" and "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but doesn't specify the sample type or confirm malignancy. There is no mention of Gleason grading.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
