Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a resection sample (most likely TURP based on the weight and preparation details), explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities", making it a benign finding. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
