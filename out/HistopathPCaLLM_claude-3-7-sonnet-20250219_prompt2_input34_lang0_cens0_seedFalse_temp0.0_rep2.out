Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a resection sample (which appears to be a transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP based on the weight and processing description), explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities," and therefore no Gleason grade is applicable.
