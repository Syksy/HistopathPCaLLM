Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sample that was prepared into tissue cassettes. The description of "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" indicates a benign condition (prostatic hyperplasia) rather than malignancy. While the sample type isn't explicitly stated, the description of weighing the sample and preparing it into cassettes is consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) procedure. There is no mention of cancer or Gleason grading, confirming this is a benign finding.
