Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate tissue sample that was processed for histological examination. The sample weight (7.5g) and preparation method suggest this is likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen. The findings indicate hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, but explicitly state "Findings do not indicate prostatic [cancer/malignancy]". Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason score is not applicable.
