Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies from left and right lobes, with only PIN-changes (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and hyperplasia noted, which are non-malignant findings. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of carcinoma," confirming the absence of malignancy.
