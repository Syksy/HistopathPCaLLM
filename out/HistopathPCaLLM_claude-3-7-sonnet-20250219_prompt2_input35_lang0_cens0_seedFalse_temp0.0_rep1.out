Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies from left and right lobes with PIN-changes and hyperplasia, but explicitly states "No signs of carcinoma," indicating this is a benign finding.
