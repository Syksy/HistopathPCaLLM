Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes samples from left and right lobes (indicating a biopsy), mentions PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes and hyperplasia, which are non-malignant findings. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or other malignancy, and consequently no Gleason score is reported.
