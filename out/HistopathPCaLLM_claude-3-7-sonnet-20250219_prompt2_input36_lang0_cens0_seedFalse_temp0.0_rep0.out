Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate specimen weighing 80 grams with nodular hyperplasia. The size and weight suggest this is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen. The report explicitly states "No signs of malignity," so malignancy is "no". Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported, thus "NA" for Gleason.
