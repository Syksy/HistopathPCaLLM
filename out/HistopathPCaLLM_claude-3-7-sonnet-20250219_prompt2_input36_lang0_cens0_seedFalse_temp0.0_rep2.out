Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate specimen weighing 80 grams with nodular hyperplasia. The sample type appears to be from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) based on the weight and dimensions of the specimen. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity," so malignancy is "no". Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported, so it's marked as "NA".
