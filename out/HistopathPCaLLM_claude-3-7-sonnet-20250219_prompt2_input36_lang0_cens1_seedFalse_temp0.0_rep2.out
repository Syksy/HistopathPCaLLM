Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia, which are benign conditions, but does not specify the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP). There is no mention of malignancy or adenocarcinoma, and consequently no Gleason grade is reported.
