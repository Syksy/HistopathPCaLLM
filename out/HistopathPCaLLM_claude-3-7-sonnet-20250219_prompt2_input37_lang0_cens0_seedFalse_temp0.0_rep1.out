Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" because the text mentions "electrosection chippings," which is characteristic of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedures. The statement indicates only hyperplasia and minor inflammation, with no mention of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "no". Since there is no malignancy reported, there is no Gleason grade, so "Gleason" is "NA".
