Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate tissue with nodular gland components and minor inflammation, but it doesn't clearly specify the sample type (whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP). It also doesn't indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present, as the examination was incomplete and further examination is planned. No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient information.
