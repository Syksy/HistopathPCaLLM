Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes needle biopsies (sample type is "biopsy"), indicates no malignancy was found ("No suspected malignity"), and since there's no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.
