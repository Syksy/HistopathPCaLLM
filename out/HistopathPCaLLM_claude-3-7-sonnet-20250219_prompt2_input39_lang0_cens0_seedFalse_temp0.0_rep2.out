Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement describes a prostatectomy specimen (which corresponds to "RP" - radical prostatectomy), identifies malignant tumor findings with 3 foci, and specifies Gleason grade with 3 as the major component and 4 as the minor component, resulting in a sum of 7.
