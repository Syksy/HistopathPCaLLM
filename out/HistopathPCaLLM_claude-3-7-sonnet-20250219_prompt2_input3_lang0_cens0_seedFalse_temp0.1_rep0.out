Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "prostate chippings" which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found," so the malignancy status is "no". Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report, so it's marked as "NA".
