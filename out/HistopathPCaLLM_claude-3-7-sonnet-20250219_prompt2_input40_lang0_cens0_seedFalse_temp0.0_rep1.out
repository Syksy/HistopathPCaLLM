Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "shaving material" which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The findings indicate "benign prostate hyperplasia" with no mention of malignancy, and specifically states "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth." Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.
