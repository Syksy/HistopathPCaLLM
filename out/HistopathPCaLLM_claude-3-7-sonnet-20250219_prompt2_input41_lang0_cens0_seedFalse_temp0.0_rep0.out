Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes systematic biopsies from the prostate with findings of inflammation and atrophied glands, but explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy", malignancy is "no", and since there is no cancer, the Gleason grade is "NA".
