Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes samples collected from the prostate lobes, which indicates a biopsy procedure. The findings mention chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, but explicitly state it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." Since no definitive cancer is reported and there's uncertainty about malignancy, I've marked "Malignancy" as "no" and "Gleason" as "NA" since no Gleason grading is provided.
