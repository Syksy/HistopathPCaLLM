Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement refers to a "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. The presence of Gleason grading confirms malignancy. The Gleason score is explicitly stated as "score 7 (4+3)" with predominant grade 4 and secondary grade 3 components.
