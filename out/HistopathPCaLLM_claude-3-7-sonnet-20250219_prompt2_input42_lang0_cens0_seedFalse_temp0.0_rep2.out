Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement refers to a "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. The text clearly describes malignant findings with Gleason grade 4 as the predominant pattern and a small amount of Gleason grade 3, with an explicitly stated summary score of "7 (4+3)".
