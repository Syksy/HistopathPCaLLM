Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate chippings, which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text explicitly states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material," indicating no malignancy was found. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
