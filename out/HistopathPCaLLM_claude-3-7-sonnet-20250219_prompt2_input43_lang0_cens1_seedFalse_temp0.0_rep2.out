Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate sample weighing approximately 30g, which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP. The pathologist notes "mostly ordinary prostate tissue" and "isolated atrophied glands" but explicitly states "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which indicates no malignancy was identified. Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
