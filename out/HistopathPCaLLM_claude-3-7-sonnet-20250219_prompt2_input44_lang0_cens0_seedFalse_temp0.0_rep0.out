Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement clearly indicates this is a prostate biopsy sample ("Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine"). While there was a history of prostate cancer in earlier biopsies, the current sample shows no malignancy ("now no tumor tissue can be seen"). Since there is no current malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
