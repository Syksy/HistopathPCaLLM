Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement clearly indicates this is a prostate biopsy sample ("Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine"). While there was cancer in earlier biopsies, the current sample shows no malignancy ("now no tumor tissue can be seen"), so the malignancy is "no". Since there is no current cancer, there is no Gleason grade to report, hence "NA".
