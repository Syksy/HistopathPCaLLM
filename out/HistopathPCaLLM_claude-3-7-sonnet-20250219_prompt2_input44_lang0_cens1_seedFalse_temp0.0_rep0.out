Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate sample examination that appears to be from a biopsy (standard routine prostate samples). The current examination shows no malignant findings ("Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes"), though there is a note about earlier biopsies having reported prostate cancer. Since the current examination doesn't show malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable.
