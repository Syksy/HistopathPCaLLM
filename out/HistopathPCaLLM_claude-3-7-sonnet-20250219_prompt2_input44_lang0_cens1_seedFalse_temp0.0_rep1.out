Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate sample examination that appears to be from a biopsy (standard routine prostate samples). The current examination shows no malignant findings ("Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes"), so malignancy is marked as "no". Since there is no current cancer finding, there is no Gleason grade to report, hence "NA". While there is a note about earlier biopsies showing prostate cancer, this is historical information and not part of the current findings.
