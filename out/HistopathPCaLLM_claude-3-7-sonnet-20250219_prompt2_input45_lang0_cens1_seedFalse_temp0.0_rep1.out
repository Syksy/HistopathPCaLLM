Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requirements:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" but doesn't clearly specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. While it mentions a "fusing tissue focus" and describes some anatomical features (seminal vesicles, lymph nodes), it doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. The statement concludes that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "further inspection is needed," indicating inconclusive findings. No Gleason grade is mentioned in the text.
