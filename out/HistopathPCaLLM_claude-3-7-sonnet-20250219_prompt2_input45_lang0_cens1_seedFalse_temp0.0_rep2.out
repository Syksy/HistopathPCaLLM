Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requirements:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" but doesn't clearly specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. While it mentions tissue focus, seminal vesicles, capsule, and lymph nodes (suggesting a surgical specimen), the sample type isn't explicitly stated. Additionally, the text indicates "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "further inspection is needed," suggesting no definitive malignancy determination was made. Without a clear malignancy determination, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
