Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "shaved prostate chippings" which indicates a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material," indicating no malignancy was found. Since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
