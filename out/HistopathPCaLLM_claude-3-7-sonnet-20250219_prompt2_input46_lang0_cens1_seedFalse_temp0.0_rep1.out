Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate tissue examination but doesn't clearly specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It mentions that the pathologist was "not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," indicating that malignancy couldn't be determined. Since no malignancy was confirmed, there is no Gleason grade reported.
