Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes prostate biopsies (three from the right and three from the left) with no malignant findings. The "3+4=7" in the text refers to the total length of biopsies in centimeters, not a Gleason score. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason field is marked as "NA".
