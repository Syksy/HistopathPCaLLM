Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes examination of prostatic material from the right and left sides, with measurements suggesting a biopsy sample. However, the pathologist explicitly states they are "not able to determine whether there is malign findings," so malignancy is marked as "NA". Without a confirmed malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report, so it's also marked as "NA".
