Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate resection (RP) with adenocarcinoma findings (malignant). The most severe lesion mentioned is the second focus with Gleason 5 (>80%) and Gleason 4, which aligns with the summary statement of "Gleason 9 tumor". Since the most severe lesion should be reported and the summary confirms Gleason 9, I've structured it as "5+4=9" based on the predominant patterns described.
