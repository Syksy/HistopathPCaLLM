Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate resection (RP) with adenocarcinoma findings (malignant). The most severe lesion mentioned is the second focus with Gleason 5 (>80%) and Gleason 4, which aligns with the summary statement indicating a Gleason 9 tumor. Since we need to report the most severe lesion, the Gleason grade is structured as "5+4=9".
