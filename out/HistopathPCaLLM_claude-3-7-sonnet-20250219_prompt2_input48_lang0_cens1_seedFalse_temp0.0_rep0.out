Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes educational/demonstration material from multiple autopsies used for a course (URO-101). While it mentions "interesting patterns" and "histological changes," it explicitly states that this material is not used to derive differentiation scores (Gleason). The sample type is unclear (appears to be autopsy material rather than biopsy, RP, or TURP), there's no clear indication of malignancy, and no Gleason score is provided. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA".
