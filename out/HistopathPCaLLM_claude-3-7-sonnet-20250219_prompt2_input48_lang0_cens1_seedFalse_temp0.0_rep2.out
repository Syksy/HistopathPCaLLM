Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes educational/demonstration material from multiple autopsies used for a course (URO-101). While it mentions "interesting patterns" and "histological changes," it explicitly states that this material is not used to derive differentiation scores (Gleason). The sample type is unclear as it's from multiple autopsies for educational purposes rather than a clinical biopsy, RP, or TURP. There is no clear indication of malignancy status in the text. Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" since this is not a standard histopathological report for a single patient.
