Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings", which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The text confirms malignancy with "5 shavings contained carcinoma". For the Gleason grade, it states the most common class is 3 and second most common is 4, which translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
