Based on the provided text, I cannot determine the sample type, confirm the presence of malignancy, or identify a Gleason grade. The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify if they are biopsies, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). It notes "some changes that warrant further investigation" on the fifth glass, but doesn't confirm whether these changes are malignant. No Gleason grading is mentioned.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
