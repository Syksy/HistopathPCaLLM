Based on the provided statement, I cannot determine the sample type, confirm malignancy, or identify a Gleason grade. The statement only mentions "prostate samples" without specifying the type, notes some unspecified "changes" in one glass that need further investigation, but doesn't provide conclusive diagnostic information.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
