Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement clearly indicates these are prostate biopsies, no malignancy was found (specifically stating "benign prostate tissue" and "do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma"), and since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.
