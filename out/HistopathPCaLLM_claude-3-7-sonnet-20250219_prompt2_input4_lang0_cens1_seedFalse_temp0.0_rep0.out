Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate tissue sample from "standard locations" which suggests a biopsy procedure. While the statement mentions that the sample is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma, it does not report any malignant findings, so "Malignancy" is "no". Since no malignancy is reported, there is no Gleason grade to report, so "Gleason" is "NA".
