Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate tissue sample from "standard locations" which suggests a biopsy procedure. However, the statement indicates that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess" for adenocarcinoma, so malignancy cannot be determined. Since no malignancy is confirmed, there is no Gleason grade reported.
