Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified (not explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP).
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings.
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported (it mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred").

Therefore, the structured JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
