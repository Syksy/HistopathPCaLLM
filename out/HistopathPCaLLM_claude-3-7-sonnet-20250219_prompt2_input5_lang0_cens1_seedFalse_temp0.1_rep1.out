Based on the provided text, I need to structure the data according to the specified fields. After analyzing the statement, I can determine the following:

1. The sample type is not clearly specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings.
3. No specific Gleason grade is reported - the text mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred."

Therefore, the structured JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
