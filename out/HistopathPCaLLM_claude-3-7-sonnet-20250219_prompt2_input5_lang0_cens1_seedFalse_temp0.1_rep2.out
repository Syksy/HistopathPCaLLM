Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate specimen with sections that have been processed and examined, but it does not clearly specify whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Additionally, there is no definitive statement about malignancy findings, and no specific Gleason grades are reported. The text mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred" and refers to a "suspected higher sum" for further inspection, but does not provide actual Gleason scores.
