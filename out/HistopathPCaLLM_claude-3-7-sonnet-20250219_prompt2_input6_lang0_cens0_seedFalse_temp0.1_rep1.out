Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes "shaving chips" which is consistent with a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure. The findings indicate benign prostate hyperplasia with no mention of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "no". Since there is no malignancy reported, there is no Gleason grade, so "Gleason" is "NA".
