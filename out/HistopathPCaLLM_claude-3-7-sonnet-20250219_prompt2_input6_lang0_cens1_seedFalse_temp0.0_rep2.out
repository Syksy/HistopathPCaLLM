Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes fragmented prostatic operation material, which is most consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample. However, due to heavy burn artifact, the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy, and no Gleason grade was reported. The pathologist recommends re-examination due to technical challenges with the sample.
