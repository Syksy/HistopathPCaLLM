Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data as requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes fragmented prostatic operation material, which is most consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample. However, due to heavy burn artifact, the pathologist was unable to properly assess the tissue for malignancy, making the results inconclusive. No Gleason grade is mentioned, and malignancy status cannot be determined from this report.
