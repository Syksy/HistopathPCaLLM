Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate biopsies with a suspicious finding that suggests adenocarcinoma, but explicitly states that "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." Since no definitive malignancy is diagnosed (only suspicion), and no Gleason grade is provided, I've marked malignancy as "no" and Gleason as "NA".
