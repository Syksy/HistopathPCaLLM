Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes prostate biopsies with a suspicious focus that suggests adenocarcinoma, but explicitly states that "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." Since no definitive malignancy is diagnosed and only a suspicion is noted, the malignancy is marked as "no" and consequently there is no Gleason grade to report.
