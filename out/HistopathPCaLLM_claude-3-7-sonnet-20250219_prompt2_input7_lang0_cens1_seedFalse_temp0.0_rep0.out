Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate sample collection (most likely a biopsy based on the context), where some atypical structures were noted but were too small to draw definite conclusions. The rest of the material showed typical structures, suggesting no clear malignancy was identified. Since no malignancy was definitively diagnosed, there is no Gleason grade reported.
