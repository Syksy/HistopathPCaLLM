Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a prostate sample collection that appears to be a biopsy. While there was "a point of interest, with some atypical structures and morphological changes," the finding was described as "diminishingly small" with no definite conclusions drawn. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since no malignancy was definitively identified and no Gleason grade was mentioned, I've marked malignancy as "no" and Gleason as "NA".
