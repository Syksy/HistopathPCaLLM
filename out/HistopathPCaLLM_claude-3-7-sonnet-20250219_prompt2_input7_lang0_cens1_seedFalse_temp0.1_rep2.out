Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes a prostate sample collection, which appears to be a biopsy. While there was a "point of interest" with "atypical structures," the finding was described as "diminishingly small" with no definite conclusions drawn. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since no malignancy was definitively identified and no Gleason grade was mentioned, I've marked malignancy as "no" and Gleason as "NA".
