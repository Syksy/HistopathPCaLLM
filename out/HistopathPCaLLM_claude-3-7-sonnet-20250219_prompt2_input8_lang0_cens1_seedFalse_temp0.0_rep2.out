Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes multiple samples (indexed 1, 2, and 3), with samples 1 and 2 confirmed to be free of malignant findings. Sample 3 contains the prostate tissue of interest, but the Gleason patterns are described as "missing" with empty fields for major and minor grades. While there's mention of "potentially interesting properties" and "PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) being discussed, there is no clear statement about malignancy in sample 3, and no Gleason score is reported. The sample type appears to be a biopsy based on the description of multiple samples with indices.
