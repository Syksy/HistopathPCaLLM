Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes multiple samples (indices 1, 2, and 3) with some discussion about histological properties and potential PIN-changes, but it doesn't clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). While it mentions that samples 1 and 2 were free of malignant findings, it doesn't explicitly state whether sample 3 contained malignancy. The Gleason score is described as missing with "empty fields ? and ?" for major and minor patterns. Since the information is incomplete and ambiguous, I've marked all fields as "NA".
