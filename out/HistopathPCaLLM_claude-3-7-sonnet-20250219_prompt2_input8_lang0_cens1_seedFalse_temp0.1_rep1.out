Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement discusses multiple samples and mentions potential PIN-changes (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) and some discussion about Gleason patterns, but it doesn't clearly state:
1. The sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP)
2. Whether there was a definitive malignant finding in the primary sample of interest
3. A specific Gleason grade in the format requested

The text mentions that Gleason patterns appear missing with "empty fields" and "no grade score is reported," suggesting incomplete or inconclusive findings. While samples 1 and 2 were free of malignant findings, the status of sample 3 (the main sample) remains unclear regarding malignancy.
