Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement describes multiple samples with indices 1, 2, and 3, but doesn't clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). While it mentions prostate tissue, it doesn't definitively state the malignancy status of sample 3 (only that samples 1 and 2 were free of malignant findings). The Gleason grade information is incomplete with "empty fields ? and ?" mentioned, indicating missing information. Due to these ambiguities and incomplete information, I've assigned "NA" to all three structured fields.
