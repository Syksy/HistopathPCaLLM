Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the description of "electrosection shavings" being obtained as the sample material, which is characteristic of TURP procedures. The statement clearly indicates "No malignant findings are observed" and mentions "benign hyperplasia," so malignancy is "no". Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported, thus it is "NA".
