Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) based on the description of "electrosection shavings" being obtained as the sample material, which is characteristic of TURP procedures.

The text explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed," so malignancy is "no".

Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, thus "NA".
