Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to the requested format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text describes examination of prostate tissue but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The description indicates normal epithelial cell lining with some disproportionate glandular structures attributed to technical difficulties in processing. No malignancy is mentioned, and since there's no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade reported.
