Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: The text doesn't explicitly mention whether this is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP, so "NA" is appropriate.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The mention of Gleason scores (4 and 3) indicates malignant findings are present, as Gleason grading is only applied to adenocarcinoma.
3. **gleason_grade**: The text mentions "Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3" - following the convention of reporting the most prevalent pattern first, this would be "4+3=7".
