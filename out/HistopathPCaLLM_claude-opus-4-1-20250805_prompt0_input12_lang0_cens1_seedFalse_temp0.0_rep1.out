Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "eight batches" which is typical for prostate biopsy procedures
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The examination is incomplete (images are still in queue), so no definitive finding about malignancy is available
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as the examination is not complete
