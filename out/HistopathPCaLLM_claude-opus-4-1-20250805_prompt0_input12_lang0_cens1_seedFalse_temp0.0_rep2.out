Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "eight batches" which is typical for prostate biopsy procedures
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - No definitive diagnosis is provided; the sample is only described as "suspected prostate cancer tissue" and examination appears incomplete
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is reported in the statement
