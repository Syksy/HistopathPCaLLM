Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and references multiple samples (sample B), which is consistent with biopsy sampling
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but indicates that "further verification is needed via consultation", meaning no definitive malignant finding has been confirmed
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
