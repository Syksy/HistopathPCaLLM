Based on the provided text, I can extract the following structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a histopathological examination in progress, but:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP based on the description)
2. No definitive statement about malignant findings is made - only mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and a colleague's comparison to a Gleason 7 patient
3. No Gleason grade is reported for this patient - the text explicitly states "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted, especially before making a statement affecting any potential intervention-decisions"

The report appears to be preliminary or incomplete, pending further investigation and discussion at an upcoming meeting.
