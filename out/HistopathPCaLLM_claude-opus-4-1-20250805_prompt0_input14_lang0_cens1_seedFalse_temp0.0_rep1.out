Based on the provided text, I can extract the following structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a histopathological examination in progress, but:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified (mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't indicate if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No definitive statement about malignant findings is made (only mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references to a colleague's comparison to a Gleason 7 patient, but no conclusive diagnosis)
3. No Gleason grade is reported for this patient (only a reference to another patient with Gleason 7)

The statement indicates that further investigation is needed before making any definitive conclusions.
