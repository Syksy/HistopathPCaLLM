Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates that findings are inconclusive at this time. While clinical notes mention suspected adenocarcinoma, the histopathological examination could not confirm or deny malignancy yet, requiring further examination.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - The text explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." The mention of "Gleason sum of 8 or above" is only from clinical notes/suspicion, not from actual histopathological findings.
