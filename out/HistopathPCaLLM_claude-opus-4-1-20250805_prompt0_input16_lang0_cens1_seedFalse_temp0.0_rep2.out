Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Rationale:
- **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" which is consistent with biopsy sampling
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The statement discusses "various grades of cell differentiation" and mentions potential Gleason grades (3+4 or 4+3), indicating malignant findings are present
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - While malignancy appears to be present, the statement explicitly indicates that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive" and that grading needs to be conducted manually, so no definitive Gleason grade is reported
