Based on the provided text, this appears to be a preliminary report describing sample preparation and processing, but it does not contain definitive diagnostic findings. The text mentions that assessment will be conducted by resident candidates in a future session, and results will be appended later.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale:
- Sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text (though the extensive sampling A-O suggests possibly RP, this is not explicitly stated)
- No malignant findings are reported - the text only mentions that Gleason grades 3-5 "are at all present or if the material is fully healthy" as possibilities to be assessed
- No Gleason grade is reported - this will be determined in the future assessment
