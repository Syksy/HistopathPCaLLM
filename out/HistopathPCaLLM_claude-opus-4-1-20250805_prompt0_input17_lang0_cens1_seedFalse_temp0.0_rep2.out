Based on the provided text, this appears to be a preliminary report describing sample preparation and processing, but it does not contain definitive diagnostic findings. The text mentions that assessment will be conducted by resident candidates in a future course session.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale:
1. **Sample type**: While the text describes prostate tissue samples labeled A-O, it doesn't specify whether these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP.
2. **Malignant findings**: The text mentions that Gleason grades 3-5 might be present OR the material might be "fully healthy," but no definitive diagnosis is provided.
3. **Gleason grade**: Although Gleason grades 3-5 are mentioned as possibilities to be assessed, no actual diagnostic conclusion is reported.

This appears to be a preliminary/preparatory report awaiting actual diagnostic assessment.
