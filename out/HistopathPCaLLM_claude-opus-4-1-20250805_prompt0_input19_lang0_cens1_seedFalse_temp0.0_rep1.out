Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Rationale:
- **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "4 batches" of samples which is typical for biopsy procedures
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - Sample 4 shows abnormal architecture but the findings are inconclusive pending verification of potential lab error
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as malignancy has not been confirmed
