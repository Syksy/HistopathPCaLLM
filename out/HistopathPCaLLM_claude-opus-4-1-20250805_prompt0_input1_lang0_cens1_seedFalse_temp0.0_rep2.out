Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" which suggests systematic biopsy sampling
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The results are stated as "inconclusive" and "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy"
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy is inconclusive and additional inspection is needed for "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings", no Gleason grade can be determined
