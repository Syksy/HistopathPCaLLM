Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
1. **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into six sets from different regions (apex, middle, basis), which is consistent with biopsy sampling methodology.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement explicitly indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region," meaning no definitive determination could be made about malignancy.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - While the text hypothetically mentions "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," this is presented as a hypothetical scenario, not an actual finding. Since no actual Gleason grade was determined due to therapy-related tissue changes, the appropriate value is "NA".
