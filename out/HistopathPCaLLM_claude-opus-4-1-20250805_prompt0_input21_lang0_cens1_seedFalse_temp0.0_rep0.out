Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece" is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates technical issues preventing proper assessment ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment") and mentions the material needs to be revisited after QC, so no definitive determination about malignancy can be made
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as the material quality prevents proper assessment and will need to be re-evaluated
