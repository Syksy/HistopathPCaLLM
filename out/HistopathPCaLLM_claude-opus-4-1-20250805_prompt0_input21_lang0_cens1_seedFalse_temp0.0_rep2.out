Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece" is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates technical issues with the specimen quality ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment") and states that the material needs to be revisited after QC, meaning no definitive diagnosis can be made
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no definitive malignant findings can be determined due to specimen quality issues, Gleason grading is not applicable
