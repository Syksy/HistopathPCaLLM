Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

The text describes a sample that requires reprocessing, with only a prior incomplete report mentioning potential Gleason 3 findings in the apex. Since the conclusion states the sample needs to be reprocessed to validate initial suspicions, there is no definitive diagnosis in this statement.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale:
1. Sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No confirmed malignant findings - only "potential Gleason 3 findings" from an incomplete prior report that needs validation
3. No confirmed Gleason grade - the potential Gleason 3 is from an incomplete report and requires reprocessing for validation
