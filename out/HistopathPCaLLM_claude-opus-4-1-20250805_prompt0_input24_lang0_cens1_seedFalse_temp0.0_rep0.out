Based on the provided text, this appears to be a teaching/training exercise using multiple patient samples rather than a single patient's histopathological report. The text describes a mixed collection of samples used for educational purposes.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: Since this describes multiple patients' samples used for teaching purposes with various outcomes, and the instruction asks for the most severe lesion, I've extracted:
- Sample type as "NA" because multiple types are mentioned (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, shavings)
- Malignant findings as "yes" because some cases were upgraded to Gleason scores
- Gleason grade as "3+4=7" representing the highest grade mentioned in the upgrades
