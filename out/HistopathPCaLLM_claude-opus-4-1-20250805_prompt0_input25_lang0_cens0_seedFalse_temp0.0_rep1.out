Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data from the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" (tissue cylinders indicate needle biopsy samples)
- Malignant findings are "yes" (prostate adenocarcinoma is confirmed)
- The most severe lesion appears in Sample (1) with Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and pattern 3 (30%), making it a 4+3=7 (pattern 4 is listed first and represents a smaller percentage but is the more aggressive pattern, making it the primary pattern in this context)
