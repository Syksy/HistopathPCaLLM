Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: "biopsy" - The description mentions multiple numbered samples with fragmented tissue and small dimensions (0.5-1mm), which is characteristic of biopsy samples
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: "NA" - The conclusion explicitly states that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified"
3. **Gleason grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out, no Gleason grade can be assigned
