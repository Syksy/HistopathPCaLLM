Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: The examination mentions "six different sites of interest" which is consistent with a multi-site biopsy procedure.
2. **Malignant findings**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes," but does not definitively report malignant tumor. The findings are described as requiring further inspection and evaluation.
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor is definitively reported, Gleason grading is not applicable (NA).
