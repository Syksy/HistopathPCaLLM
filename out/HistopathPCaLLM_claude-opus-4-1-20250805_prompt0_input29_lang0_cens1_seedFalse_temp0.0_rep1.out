Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text describes multiple samples taken from different regions (left/right, lower/middle/higher), which is consistent with a biopsy procedure
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates that samples A and C (of particular interest) contained non-prostatic tissue and could not be properly assessed, making it impossible to determine if malignant findings were present
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - The text explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible" and samples need to be re-examined
