Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data from the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

The structured data reflects:
1. The sample type is "biopsy" (targeted biopsies were performed)
2. Malignant tumor findings were "yes" (malignant focus found)
3. The Gleason grade from the most severe lesion (second targeted biopsy) is "4+5=9" (primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5)
