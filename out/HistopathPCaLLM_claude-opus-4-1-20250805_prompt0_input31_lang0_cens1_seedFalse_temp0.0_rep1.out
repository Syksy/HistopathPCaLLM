Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

The text describes a case where samples were taken after imaging due to suspicious symptoms. However, the findings are described as "suspicious" rather than definitively malignant, comprising only 5% of the samples. The interpretation was difficult and additional samples are needed.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Note: I interpreted this as "biopsy" since samples were taken after imaging for diagnostic purposes. The findings are described as "suspicious" rather than confirmed malignant, and no Gleason grade is reported, suggesting no definitive cancer diagnosis was made.
