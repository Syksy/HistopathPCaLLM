Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

The analysis shows:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor findings are "yes" - multifocal adenocarcinoma was found in the prostate
3. The most severe Gleason grade reported is "4+4=8" (mentioned as the pattern observed particularly in the base of the prostate)
