Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data focusing on the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

The rationale:
1. Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the text
2. Malignant tumor findings is "yes" because adenocarcinoma was found in the prostate
3. The Gleason grade "4+4=8" represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement (other patterns mentioned were 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3, which are all less severe)
