Note: The text mentions "primary prostate tissue", "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles" which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. The reference to "findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain" suggests malignant findings were present in the prostate, though specific Gleason grading is not provided in this update statement.
