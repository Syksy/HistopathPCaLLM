Based on the provided text, I can extract the following structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles" being examined and clear, which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. However, the text does not provide clear information about whether malignant tumor was found in the prostate tissue itself or any Gleason grading, so these fields are marked as "NA".
