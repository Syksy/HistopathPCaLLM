Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Note: The mention of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. The text explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles [vesicles]" and describes "possibly abnormal findings" in lymph nodes without confirming malignancy, so the overall assessment is no malignant tumor findings.
