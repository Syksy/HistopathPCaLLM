Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type appears to be "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the mention of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are typically examined in RP specimens
- No malignant findings are explicitly stated ("No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and only "possibly abnormal findings" in lymph nodes, which doesn't confirm malignancy)
- Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignant tumor was found
