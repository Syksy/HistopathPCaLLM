Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type is "TURP" - the weight (7.5g) and description of tissue cassettes suggest this is a TURP specimen
2. Malignant tumor findings is "no" - the statement indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic [malignancy]" and describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which are benign findings
3. Gleason grade is "NA" - since this is a benign specimen with no malignant findings, no Gleason grade is applicable
