Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" (inferred from the description of samples from left and right lobes)
- Malignant tumor findings is "no" (only PIN changes and hyperplasia are mentioned, no carcinoma/cancer reported)
- Gleason grade is "NA" (not applicable for benign findings)
