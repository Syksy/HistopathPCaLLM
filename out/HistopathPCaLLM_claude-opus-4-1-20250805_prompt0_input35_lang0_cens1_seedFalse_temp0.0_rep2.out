Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The statement mentions samples from left and right lobes with multiple sites, which is typical of prostate biopsy sampling
- **malignant_tumor**: "no" - The statement only mentions high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and hyperplasia, both of which are non-malignant findings. No carcinoma or malignant tumor is reported
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grading is not applicable
