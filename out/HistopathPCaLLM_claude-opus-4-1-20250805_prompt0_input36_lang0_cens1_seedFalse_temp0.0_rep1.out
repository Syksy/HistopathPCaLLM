Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (references to cassettes and nodular hyperplasia could suggest TURP or RP, but it's not definitively stated)
2. Only benign findings are mentioned (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia) with no malignant tumor reported
3. Gleason grade is NA as this appears to be a benign specimen with no malignancy
