Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be TURP based on description but not definitively stated)
2. The findings describe hyperplasia (benign growth), not malignant tumor
3. Gleason grade is NA as this is a benign finding
