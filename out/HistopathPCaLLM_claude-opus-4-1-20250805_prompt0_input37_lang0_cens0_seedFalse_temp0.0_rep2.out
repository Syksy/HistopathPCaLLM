Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" because "electrosection chippings" refers to transurethral resection of the prostate
- Malignant tumor findings is "no" because the findings indicate hyperplasia (benign prostatic hyperplasia) with no mention of carcinoma or malignancy
- Gleason grade is "NA" because this is a benign finding (hyperplasia) and Gleason grading only applies to malignant prostate cancer
