Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **sample_type**: "TURP" - The mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" and "done in a single run" suggests this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as these typically yield multiple grams of tissue
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The examination was inconclusive due to burn artifacts preventing detailed examination
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as the examination was inconclusive
