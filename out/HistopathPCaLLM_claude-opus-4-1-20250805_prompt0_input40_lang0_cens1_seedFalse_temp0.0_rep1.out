Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **sample_type**: "TURP" - The weight measurement (8.9g) and use of multiple cassettes suggests this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The report is inconclusive, mentioning only hyperplasia and inflammation with uncertainty ("possibly something else") and stating further examination is needed
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as no definitive malignant findings are reported
