Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The statement mentions samples collected from left and right lobes, which is typical of a biopsy procedure
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - The pathologist states it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not" and only mentions chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, with no definitive malignant findings reported
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no malignant tumor was identified, Gleason grading is not applicable
