Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The statement mentions samples collected from left and right lobes, which is typical of biopsy procedures
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - The pathologist states it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not" and only reports chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, with no definitive malignant findings
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignant tumor was identified
