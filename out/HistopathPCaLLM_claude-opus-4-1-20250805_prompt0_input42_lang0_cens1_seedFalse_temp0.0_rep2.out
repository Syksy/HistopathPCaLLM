Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "Prostate sample" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined," indicating an indeterminate result
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be confirmed, no Gleason grade can be assigned
