Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" based on the description of "30g prostate samples" and "material placed in cassettes and in the jar" which is typical for TURP specimens
- Malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and only mentions ordinary prostate tissue and atrophied glands
- Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignant findings were reported
