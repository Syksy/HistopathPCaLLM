Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "RP" - The mention of seminal vesicles, capsule, marginals (margins), and lymph nodes indicates this is a radical prostatectomy specimen
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - No clear malignant findings are reported. The tissue is described as "suspect" and "unclear," with "further inspection needed," but no definitive malignancy is stated
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no malignant tumor is definitively identified, no Gleason grade can be assigned
