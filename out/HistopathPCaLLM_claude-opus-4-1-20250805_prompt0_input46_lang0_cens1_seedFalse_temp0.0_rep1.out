Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "TURP" - The description mentions "Prostate material total size around 2x" and that material was "set on cassettes" with a "smaller portion of material was run", which is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen processing.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The pathologist explicitly states they are "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not", indicating an indeterminate result.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
