Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The statement indicates that prostate samples were investigated but:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported (only mentions "changes that warrant further investigation")
- No Gleason grade is provided
- The assessment could not be completed due to technical limitations

Therefore, all fields are marked as "NA" due to insufficient or inconclusive information.
