Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Rationale:
1. **sample_type**: "RP" - The description mentions an enlarged prostate specimen with systematic sampling from left/right, apex/basis, and assessment of the prostate capsule, which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "suspected higher sum," indicating the presence of malignant tumor with Gleason grading attempted.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - While malignancy is present, the statement explicitly says "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" and mentions the case is being referred to a colleague for further inspection, indicating that a definitive Gleason grade cannot be determined from this report.
