Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "RP" - The description mentions samples from apex and basis, processing with dyes for left/right orientation, and reference to prostate capsule, which are typical of radical prostatectomy specimens.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "suspected higher sum," indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - While malignancy is present, the text explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" and mentions referral to a colleague for further inspection, indicating the Gleason grade cannot be determined from this report.
