Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Rationale:
1. **sample_type**: "RP" - The statement mentions "samples taken from both apex and basis" and processing with dyes for left/right orientation, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen handling.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text references "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "different kind of architectures" with a "suspected higher sum," indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" and the case was referred to a colleague for further inspection, meaning no definitive Gleason grade is reported.
