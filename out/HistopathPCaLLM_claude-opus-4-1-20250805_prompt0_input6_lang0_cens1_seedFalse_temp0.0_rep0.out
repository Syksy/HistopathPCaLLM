Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **sample_type**: "TURP" - The text mentions "prostatic operation material" that is "very fragmented," which is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The results are stated as "inconclusive" due to heavy burn artifact preventing proper examination
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as the examination was inconclusive
