Note: Although adenocarcinoma is suspected in sample 1B, the pathologist explicitly states that the finding is too small to draw conclusive findings and remains at "suspicion-level" only. Therefore, this is not a definitive malignant finding, hence "no" for malignant tumor findings and "NA" for Gleason grade.
