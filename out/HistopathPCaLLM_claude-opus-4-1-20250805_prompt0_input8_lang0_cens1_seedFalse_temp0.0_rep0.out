Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: The text mentions multiple samples with indices, which is typical of biopsy procedures ("biopsy")
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: While there are mentions of "potentially interesting properties" and discussion of PIN changes, there is no clear confirmation of malignant findings. The Gleason patterns are mentioned but with missing/empty values ("?"), and samples 1 and 2 are explicitly stated to be "completely free of malignant findings" ("no")
3. **Gleason grade**: Although Gleason patterns are mentioned, the actual grades are missing (shown as "?" in the chart), and no definitive grade score is reported ("NA")
