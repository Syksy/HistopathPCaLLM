Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: The text mentions multiple samples with indices, which is typical of biopsy procedures ("biopsy")
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: While there are mentions of "potentially interesting properties" and "PIN-changes" (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia), the text explicitly states samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings" and sample 3 shows no clear malignant diagnosis. The missing Gleason scores and discussion about PIN suggests no definitive malignancy ("no")
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "empty fields ? and ?" for major and minor Gleason patterns with "no grade score reported", indicating no valid Gleason grade can be determined ("NA")
