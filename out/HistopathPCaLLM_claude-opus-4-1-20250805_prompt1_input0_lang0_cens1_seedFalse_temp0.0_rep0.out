Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," indicating no malignant findings were detected
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not applicable
