Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The text describes prostate tissue with tubular structures and mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3, indicating malignant findings. However, the sample type is not explicitly stated (no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP). The Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned but their proportion/order cannot be reliably determined from the limited material examined.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
