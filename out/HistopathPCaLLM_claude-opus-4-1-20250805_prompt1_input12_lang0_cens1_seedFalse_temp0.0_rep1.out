Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The statement indicates:
- The sample is suspected prostate cancer tissue (but sample type like biopsy/RP/TURP is not specified)
- No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported (only suspected, and examination is still pending with images in queue)
- No Gleason grade is reported
