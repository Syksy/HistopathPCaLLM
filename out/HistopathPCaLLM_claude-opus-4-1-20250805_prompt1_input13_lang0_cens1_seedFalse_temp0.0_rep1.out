Based on the provided statement, I can extract the following structured information:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and references multiple samples (sample B), which is consistent with biopsy sampling
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but explicitly states "further verification is needed via consultation", indicating no definitive malignancy diagnosis has been made
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement
