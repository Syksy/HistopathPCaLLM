Based on the provided statement, I'll structure the data according to your requirements:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and references multiple samples (sample B), which is consistent with a biopsy procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but explicitly states that "further verification is needed via consultation", indicating no definitive malignant diagnosis has been made
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
