Based on the provided text, this appears to be a histopathological examination of prostate tissue. However, the text does not provide definitive conclusions about malignancy or Gleason grading. The statement indicates that further investigation is needed before making definitive statements.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text (it mentions tissue samples and surgical margins but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP). The presence of malignancy is not confirmed (only "special patterns" are mentioned, and further investigation is warranted). No Gleason grade is reported for this patient (only a reference to comparing with another Gleason 7 patient is mentioned).
