Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "prostate tissue material" but does not specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure.
2. **Malignancy**: "NA" - No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported. The statement only mentions "suspected presence" based on clinical notes, not confirmed histopathological findings.
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - The statement explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." The Gleason sum mentioned (8 or above) is from clinical notes describing suspicion, not actual histopathological findings.
