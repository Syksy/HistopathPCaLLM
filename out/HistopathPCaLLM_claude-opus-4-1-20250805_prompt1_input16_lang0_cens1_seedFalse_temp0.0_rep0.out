Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The statement describes prostate tissue with suspicious foci that shows various grades of cell differentiation, but explicit Gleason grading cannot be determined due to technical issues with digitalization. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP). While suspicious foci with varying differentiation patterns are noted, there's no definitive statement confirming malignancy.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
