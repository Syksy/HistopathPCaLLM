Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The statement describes sample material from standard prostate procedures (likely biopsy given the 12 tissue batches mentioned), with mostly benign findings (>95%) but a small suspicious focus that cannot be properly graded due to its size. Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grade can be assigned, the findings should be considered inconclusive rather than definitively malignant.
