Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is not mentioned in the statement
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - While sample 4 shows abnormal architecture, there is no confirmed malignant tumor finding. The statement indicates uncertainty and the need for verification before determining if it's malignant
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignancy is confirmed
