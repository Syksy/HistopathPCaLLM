Based on the provided text, this appears to be a pathological examination of prostate tissue samples. However, the statement indicates that assessment of adenocarcinoma is impossible due to prior therapies affecting the tissue. The text mentions hypothetical scenarios but does not report actual findings of malignancy or Gleason grades.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text (it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" but doesn't specify if they're from biopsy, RP, or TURP). No definitive malignancy findings are reported (examination is stated as "impossible"), and no actual Gleason grade is provided (only a hypothetical example is mentioned).
