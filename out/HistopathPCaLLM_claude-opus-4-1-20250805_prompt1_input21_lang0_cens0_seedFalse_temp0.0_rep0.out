Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The reasoning:
- "Prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
- The presence of "poorly differentiated growth," "tumor-like tissue," and Gleason grading indicates malignancy
- The most common Gleason grade is 5 (major) and second most common is 4 (minor), resulting in 5+4=9
