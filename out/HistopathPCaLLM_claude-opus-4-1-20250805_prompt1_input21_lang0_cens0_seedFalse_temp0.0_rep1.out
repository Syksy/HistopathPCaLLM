Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

The reasoning:
- "Prostate chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
- The presence of "poorly differentiated growth," "tumor-like tissue," and Gleason grading indicates malignancy
- The statement indicates "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4," which translates to Gleason 5+4=9
