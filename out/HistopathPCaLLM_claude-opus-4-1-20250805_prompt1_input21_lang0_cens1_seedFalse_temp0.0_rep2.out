Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "extracted prostate material" and "fragments" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure.
2. **Malignancy**: "NA" - No definitive malignant findings are reported. The statement indicates technical issues with the specimen quality that prevent proper assessment.
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be determined as the material quality is compromised and requires additional quality control before proper evaluation can be made.
