Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The statement describes prostate tissue sampling material that cannot be properly assessed due to fragmentation, contamination concerns, and inability to determine malignancies. The sample type appears to be biopsy (tissue sampling material), but malignancy cannot be determined and no Gleason grade can be assigned.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
