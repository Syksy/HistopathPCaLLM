Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

The statement describes prostate tissue sampling material that cannot be properly assessed due to fragmentation, contamination concerns, and difficulty in evaluation. The key points are:
- It's prostate tissue sampling material (appears to be biopsy based on the description)
- Malignancy cannot be determined due to sample quality issues
- Gleason grade cannot be assigned due to the inability to assess the samples

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
