Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data from the most severe lesion:

The statement describes multiple biopsy samples with adenocarcinoma findings. Sample (1) shows Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and pattern 3 (30%), while Sample (2) shows Gleason pattern 4 (15%) and pattern 3 (<35%). Since Sample (1) has a higher percentage of Gleason pattern 4, it represents the most severe lesion with a Gleason score of 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
