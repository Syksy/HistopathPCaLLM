Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

The statement describes multiple samples (1-3) from what appears to be a biopsy procedure. The key finding is that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified," indicating that no definitive malignant diagnosis could be made. The samples showed some tissue that couldn't be properly assessed, and initial PIN changes were retracted as unreliable.
