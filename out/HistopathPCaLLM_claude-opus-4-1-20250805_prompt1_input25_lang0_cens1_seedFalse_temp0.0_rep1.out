Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text describes multiple tissue samples with fragments and measurable dimensions typical of biopsy specimens
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The conclusion explicitly states that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified"
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignancy was confirmed
