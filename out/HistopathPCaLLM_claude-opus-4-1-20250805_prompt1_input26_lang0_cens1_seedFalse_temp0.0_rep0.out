Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen
2. **Malignancy**: "NA" - No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported in this statement; the material is described as "very difficult to assess" due to radiation therapy
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - While clinical notes mention a possible "Gleason sum 7", the statement explicitly indicates this is unclear and unverified, and the histopathology cannot be reasonably assessed due to recent radiation therapy
