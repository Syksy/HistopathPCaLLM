Based on the provided pathological statement, I can extract the following structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "six different sites of interest" which is consistent with a multi-site biopsy procedure
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes," but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor/adenocarcinoma
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is reported as no malignancy was confirmed
