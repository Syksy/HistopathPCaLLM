Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g" and describes systematic sampling from apex through multiple planes (A-F cassettes). This systematic sampling approach and the whole prostate weight indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" - indicating malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" and concludes with "Score sum 7". Although there appears to be a typo (both grades mentioned as 4), the summary clearly states score sum 7, which in Gleason scoring must be 4+3=7 (since grade 4 is mentioned as the predominant pattern).
