Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The sample is from an autopsy specimen, which doesn't match any of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - No definitive malignant findings are reported; the statement indicates that further inspection is needed and malignant changes cannot be reliably inferred
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
