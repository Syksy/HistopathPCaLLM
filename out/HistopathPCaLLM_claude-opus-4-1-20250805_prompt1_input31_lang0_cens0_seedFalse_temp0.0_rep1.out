Based on the provided statement, I need to identify the most severe lesion and structure the data accordingly.

The statement describes multiple biopsies:
1. Routine systematic biopsy: Gleason 3+3=6
2. First targeted biopsy: technical failure (no result)
3. Second targeted biopsy: primary pattern 4, second pattern appears to be 5 (Gleason 4+5=9)

The most severe lesion is from the second targeted biopsy with Gleason 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
