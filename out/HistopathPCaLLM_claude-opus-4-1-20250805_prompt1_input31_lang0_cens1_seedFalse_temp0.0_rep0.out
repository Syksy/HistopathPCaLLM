Based on the provided statement, I can extract the following structured information:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples were taken" after imaging due to suspicious symptoms, which indicates a biopsy procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The findings are described only as "suspicious" without definitive confirmation of malignancy
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement
