Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion found in the radical prostatectomy specimen:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The statement describes a radical prostatectomy (RP) with multifocal adenocarcinoma. The most severe Gleason pattern mentioned is 4+4, which represents the highest grade lesion among the patterns described (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3).
