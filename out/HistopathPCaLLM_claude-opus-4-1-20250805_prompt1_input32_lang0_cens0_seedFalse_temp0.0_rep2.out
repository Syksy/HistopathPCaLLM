Based on the statement, I need to identify the most severe lesion from the radical prostatectomy specimen. The text mentions multiple Gleason patterns were found in the prostate, with Gleason 4+4=8 being the highest/most severe pattern mentioned.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
