Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vesicles" and only mentions "possibly abnormal findings" in lymph nodes, which doesn't confirm malignancy
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no malignancy is confirmed, Gleason grade is not applicable
