Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely meaning prostatic carcinoma) and describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which are benign findings
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not applicable
