Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type appears to be "biopsy" based on the description of samples from left and right lobes
- No malignant tumor (adenocarcinoma) is mentioned - only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and hyperplasia are noted, which are not malignant
- Gleason grade is "NA" since no malignancy was found
