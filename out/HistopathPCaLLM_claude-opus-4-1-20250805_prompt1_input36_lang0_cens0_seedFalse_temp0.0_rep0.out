Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is determined to be "RP" (radical prostatectomy) based on the weight (80g) and dimensions (7 x 6 x 5 cm) which are consistent with a whole prostate specimen. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity" indicating no malignant tumor findings, and since there is no malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
