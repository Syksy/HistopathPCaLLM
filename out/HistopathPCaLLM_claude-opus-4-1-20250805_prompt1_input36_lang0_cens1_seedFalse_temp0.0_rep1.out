Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text (mentions sample size/weight and cassettes but doesn't specify if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No malignant tumor findings are reported - only hyperplasia (benign finding) is mentioned
3. Gleason grade is NA as this is a benign finding with no malignancy detected
