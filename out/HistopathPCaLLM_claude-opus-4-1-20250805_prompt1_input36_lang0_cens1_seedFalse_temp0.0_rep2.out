Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify if this is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP specimen
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement mentions hyperplasia (both nodular and epithelial), which is benign, and no malignant findings are reported
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grading is not applicable
