Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- "Electrosection chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
- The findings describe hyperplasia and inflammation, with no mention of carcinoma or malignancy
- Since there is no malignancy, Gleason grade is not applicable (NA)
