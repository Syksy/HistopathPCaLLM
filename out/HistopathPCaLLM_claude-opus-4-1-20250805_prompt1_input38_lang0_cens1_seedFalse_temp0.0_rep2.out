Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - The findings mention only hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, which are benign conditions. No malignant tumor is reported
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - Since there is no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable
