Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings"
- **Gleason**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point"
