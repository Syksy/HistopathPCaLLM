Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" based on the description of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" processed "in a single run", which is characteristic of TURP specimens
- Malignancy is "NA" because burn artifacts prevented detailed examination and "nothing conclusive may be derived"
- Gleason is "NA" as no malignancy could be assessed due to the examination limitations
