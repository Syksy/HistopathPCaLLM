Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type appears to be TURP based on the weight measurement and cassette usage typical of transurethral resection specimens. The malignancy status is "NA" because the statement is inconclusive - it mentions "possibly something else" and that "further examination is needed" without confirming presence or absence of malignancy. Consequently, the Gleason grade is also "NA" as no definitive malignant findings are reported.
