Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "Prostate sample" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined", indicating an indeterminate finding
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as malignancy cannot be confirmed
