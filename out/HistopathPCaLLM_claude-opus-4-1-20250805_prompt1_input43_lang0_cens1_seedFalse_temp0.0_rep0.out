Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" based on the description of "30g prostate samples" with material in cassettes and jar, which is typical of TURP specimens
- Malignancy is "no" as the statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and only mentions ordinary prostate tissue and atrophied glands
- Gleason is "NA" since no malignancy was found
