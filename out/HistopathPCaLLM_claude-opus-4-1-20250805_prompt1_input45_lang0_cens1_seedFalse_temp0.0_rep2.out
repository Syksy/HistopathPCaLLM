Based on the provided pathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The text mentions "suspect prostate sample" but doesn't clearly specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement indicates negative margins, intact capsule, no metastases in lymph nodes, and mentions that further inspection is needed without confirming malignancy
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignancy is confirmed
