Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- "Shaved prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
- "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" clearly indicates no malignancy was found
- Since there is no malignancy, Gleason grade is not applicable (NA)
