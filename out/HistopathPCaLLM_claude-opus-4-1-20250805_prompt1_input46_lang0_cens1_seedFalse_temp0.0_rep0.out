Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The pathologist explicitly states they are "not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned
