Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure
2. **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right"
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade is applicable
