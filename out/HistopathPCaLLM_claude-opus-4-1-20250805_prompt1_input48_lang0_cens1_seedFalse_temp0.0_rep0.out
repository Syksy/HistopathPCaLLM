Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - While the text mentions "autopsy" samples, this is not one of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement does not clearly indicate whether malignant tumor findings were present or absent
- **Gleason**: "NA" - The text explicitly states that Gleason scores are not being derived from this material as it's for educational/demonstration purposes
