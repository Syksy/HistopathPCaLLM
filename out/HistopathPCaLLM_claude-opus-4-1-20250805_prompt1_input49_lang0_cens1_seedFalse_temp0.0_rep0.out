Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify if they are from biopsy, RP, or TURP. The findings are inconclusive ("changes that warrant further investigation") and cannot be definitively assessed due to technical limitations, so malignancy cannot be determined. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, no Gleason grade is reported.
