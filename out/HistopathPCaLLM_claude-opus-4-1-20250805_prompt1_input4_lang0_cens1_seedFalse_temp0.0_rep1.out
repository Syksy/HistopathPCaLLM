Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "several sampling sites" and "sample material" which indicates this is a biopsy procedure
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement indicates "no notable atypic patterns are present" and while the sample is insufficient for complete assessment, no malignancy was detected in the examined tissue
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignancy was found
