Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "RP" - The statement mentions "relatively enlarged prostate" with systematic sampling from apex and basis, and processing with dyes (yellow for left, green for right), which is consistent with radical prostatectomy specimen processing
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement does not definitively confirm presence or absence of malignancy; it mentions that Gleason grades could not be inferred and samples were referred for further inspection
- **Gleason**: "NA" - The statement explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred"
