Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "RP" - The description indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy specimen (whole prostate with apex and basis samplings, capsule mentioned)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement does not definitively confirm presence or absence of malignancy; it mentions Gleason grading could not be inferred and samples were referred for further inspection
- **Gleason**: "NA" - The statement explicitly says "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred"
