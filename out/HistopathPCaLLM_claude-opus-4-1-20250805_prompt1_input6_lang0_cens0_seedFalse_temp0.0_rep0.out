Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "TURP" - The description of "shaving chips" is characteristic of a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement indicates "benign prostate hyperplasia" with no mention of malignant findings
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade is applicable
