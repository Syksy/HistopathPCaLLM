Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" as the text mentions "prostatic operation material" that is "very fragmented" with "heavy burn artefact", which are characteristic features of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
- Malignancy is "NA" because the results are stated as "inconclusive" due to technical challenges
- Gleason is "NA" as no malignancy was identified and the examination was inconclusive
