Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text explicitly mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. **Malignancy**: "no" - While there are suspicious findings suggesting adenocarcinoma, the pathologist states that "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." This indicates no definitive malignant diagnosis was made.
3. **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no definitive malignancy was diagnosed, no Gleason grade is applicable.
