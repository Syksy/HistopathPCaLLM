Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "prostate sample material was routinely collected" which suggests a biopsy procedure
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement indicates "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and mentions only "atypical structures" without confirming malignancy. The rest of the material showed typical/expected structures
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignant tumor was definitively identified
