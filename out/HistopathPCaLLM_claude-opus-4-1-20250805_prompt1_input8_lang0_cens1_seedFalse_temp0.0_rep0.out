Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: The text doesn't clearly specify if this is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP sample, so "NA" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: While the text mentions "Gleason patterns" and discusses suspicious findings (PIN-changes), there is no definitive statement confirming malignancy. The Gleason grades are missing (shown as "?"), and samples 1 and 2 are explicitly benign. The findings in sample 3 are described as "potentially interesting" and "suspicious" but not definitively malignant. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.

3. **Gleason**: The text explicitly states that Gleason grades are missing with "empty fields ? and ?" for major and minor patterns, so "NA" is appropriate.
