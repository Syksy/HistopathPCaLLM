Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 3):

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: The text doesn't specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP specimen, so "NA" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: While sample 3 shows "potentially interesting properties" and there's mention of Gleason patterns, the statement is ambiguous about whether malignancy is definitively present. The mention of "empty fields" for Gleason scores and "recording mishap" suggests incomplete documentation. Samples 1 and 2 are explicitly benign, but sample 3's status is unclear. Given this ambiguity, "NA" is the most appropriate value.

3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "empty fields ? and ?" for major and minor Gleason patterns, indicating the scores were not recorded. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.
