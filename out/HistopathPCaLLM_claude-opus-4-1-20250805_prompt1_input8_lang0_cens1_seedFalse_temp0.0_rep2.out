Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 3):

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: The text doesn't specify whether this is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure, so "NA" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: While sample 3 shows "potentially interesting properties" and mentions Gleason patterns, the actual presence of malignancy is ambiguous. The text mentions "PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) which is not invasive cancer, and samples 1 and 2 are "completely free of malignant findings." The status of sample 3 regarding definitive malignancy is unclear, warranting "NA".

3. **Gleason**: Although Gleason patterns are mentioned, the actual grades are missing (shown as "empty fields ? and ?"), making it impossible to provide a valid Gleason score in the required format, thus "NA".
