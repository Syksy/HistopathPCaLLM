Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The sample type is identified as "TURP" based on the mention of "electrosection shavings" which is characteristic of transurethral resection procedures. The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed" and describes benign hyperplasia, so malignancy is "no". Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
