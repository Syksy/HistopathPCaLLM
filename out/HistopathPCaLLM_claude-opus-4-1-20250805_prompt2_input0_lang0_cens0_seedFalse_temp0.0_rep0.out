Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Chipping samples" which refers to tissue chips obtained during TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and describes "benign prostate tissue" with findings consistent with "benign prostate hyperplasia."

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable.
