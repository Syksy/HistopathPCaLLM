Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sample material" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn." This indicates no malignant findings were identified. Therefore: "no"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found (benign findings), Gleason grading is not applicable. Therefore: "NA"
