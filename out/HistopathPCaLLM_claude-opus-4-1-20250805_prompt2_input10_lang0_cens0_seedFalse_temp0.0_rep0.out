Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma" and concludes with "diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." Since no definitive malignant tumor was diagnosed (only suspicion-level findings), the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor was definitively diagnosed, no Gleason grade is reported.
