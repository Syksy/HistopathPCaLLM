Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma" and concludes with "diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." This means no definitive malignant tumor was found - the finding is only suspicious/uncertain.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive malignancy was diagnosed, no Gleason grade would be reported.
