Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to examining "basis, apex and mid section" which suggests a whole prostate examination, but doesn't explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP).

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Gleason scores" and specifically "score 4 and score 3" which are only used for malignant findings. Despite the limited material (5%), the presence of Gleason scoring indicates malignancy was found.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "score 4 and score 3" which indicates a Gleason pattern of 4+3=7 for the most severe lesion.
