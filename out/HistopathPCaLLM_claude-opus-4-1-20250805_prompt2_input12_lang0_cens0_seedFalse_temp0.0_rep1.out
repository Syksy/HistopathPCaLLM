Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate" which indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as electrosection/electrocautery shavings are characteristic of TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "the material is classified as benign" and mentions "normal prostate tissue like architecture", indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable.
