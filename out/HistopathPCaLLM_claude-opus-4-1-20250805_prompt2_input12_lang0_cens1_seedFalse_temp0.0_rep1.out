Looking at this statement, I can extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "eight batches" which suggests multiple samples, likely from a biopsy procedure (as this is typical for prostate cancer diagnosis where multiple core biopsies are taken).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the tissue is "suspected prostate cancer tissue" and that examination has been started, but high resolution images are still pending in the digipathology queue. This means the final diagnosis has not been made yet.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported as the examination is incomplete.

Since the examination is incomplete and awaiting further analysis, the definitive results are not available.
