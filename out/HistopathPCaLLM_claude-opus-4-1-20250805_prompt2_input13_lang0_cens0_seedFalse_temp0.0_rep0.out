Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies" - this indicates a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "carcinoma is observed" - this confirms malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text reports "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)" - this gives us the Gleason score of 4+5=9.
