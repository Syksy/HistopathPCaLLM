Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies" which indicates this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "carcinoma is observed" which clearly indicates malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text reports "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)" which gives us the Gleason score in the required format.
