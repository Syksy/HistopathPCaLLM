Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Without clear indication of the procedure type, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "irregularities" and a "suspicious pattern" that requires "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification is needed via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the pathologist has not definitively diagnosed malignancy but has identified concerning features requiring additional review. Since there is no definitive malignant tumor finding reported, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement. Gleason grades are only assigned when malignancy is confirmed, and this statement describes suspicious findings pending consultation rather than confirmed cancer. Therefore, this is "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
