Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. The mention of multiple samples from different locations (right, left, sample B) suggests this could be a biopsy series, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that require "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the pathologist has not definitively diagnosed malignancy but has identified suspicious findings requiring additional review.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the fact that no definitive malignancy has been diagnosed.

Since this statement describes suspicious findings under review but no confirmed diagnosis, and lacks specific information about sample type and Gleason grading, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
