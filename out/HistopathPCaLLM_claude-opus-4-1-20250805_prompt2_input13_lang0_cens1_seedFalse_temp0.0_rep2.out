Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples from different locations (right/left sides, sample B) suggests this could be a biopsy series, but it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "irregularities" and a "suspicious pattern" that requires "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the pathologist hasn't made a definitive diagnosis of malignancy yet. They're noting suspicious findings but deferring final determination.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which makes sense given that no definitive malignancy diagnosis has been made.

Since this appears to be an incomplete or preliminary report awaiting consultation rather than a final histopathological diagnosis, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
