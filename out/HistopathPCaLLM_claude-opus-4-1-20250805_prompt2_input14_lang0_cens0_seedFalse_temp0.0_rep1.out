Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly describes "tumorous growth" and "tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Since Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7, and the text indicates that score 3 comprises approximately 60% (the larger portion), this indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
