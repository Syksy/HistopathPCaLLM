Looking at this statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "specimen," "prostate tissue," "samples," and "surgical margin status." However, it doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. The mention of "surgical margin status" and "prostate capsule" suggests it might be from a surgical specimen, but this is not definitive enough.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," but it explicitly states that "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted, especially before making a statement affecting any potential intervention-decisions." This indicates no definitive malignancy diagnosis has been made yet.

3. **Gleason grade**: While there's a reference to another patient with "Gleason 7 score," no Gleason grade is reported for this current specimen. The text suggests more investigation is needed before any grading can be determined.

This appears to be a preliminary or incomplete pathological assessment where definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn.
