Looking at this statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "specimen," "prostate tissue," "samples," and "surgical margin status." While it doesn't explicitly state the sample type, the reference to "surgical margin status" and the comprehensive nature of the specimen suggests this could be from a radical prostatectomy (RP). However, the text is ambiguous and doesn't clearly specify the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," but it explicitly states that "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted, especially before making a statement affecting any potential intervention-decisions." This indicates no definitive malignancy diagnosis has been made yet.

3. **Gleason grade**: While there's a reference to another patient with "Gleason 7 score," no Gleason grade is reported for this patient's specimen. The text indicates more investigation is needed.

Since this statement does not provide definitive diagnostic conclusions and explicitly states that further investigation is needed before making any statements, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
