Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g" - this indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as "chippings" or "shavings" are characteristic of TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material" - indicating malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8" - this indicates a Gleason score with a sum of 8. Since Gleason 4 is mentioned as the most represented (major component), and the sum is 8, this would be 4+4=8.
