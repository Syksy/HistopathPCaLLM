Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that no definitive malignant findings were made. It mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but this is not a confirmed histopathological finding. The text explicitly states that findings need to be revised in the next examination to "either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion." Therefore, this is "no" (no confirmed malignancy at this time).

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement clearly indicates that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." While clinical notes mention suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this is explicitly stated as "not based on any histopathology." Therefore, this is "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
