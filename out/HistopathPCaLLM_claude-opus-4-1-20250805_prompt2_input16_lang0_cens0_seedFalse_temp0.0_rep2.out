Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate" - clearly indicating this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses" and describes carcinoma findings, confirming malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text describes "mainly level 3 grade growth" with "some Gleason 4-type" structures. It concludes with "score 7" and mentions "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This indicates Gleason 3 is the major component and Gleason 4 is the minor component, resulting in 3+4=7.
