Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Multiple clear foci emerge" with "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", and mentions "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule" - these are clear indicators of malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". Following standard Gleason scoring convention where the most dominant pattern is listed first, this would be 4+3=7.
