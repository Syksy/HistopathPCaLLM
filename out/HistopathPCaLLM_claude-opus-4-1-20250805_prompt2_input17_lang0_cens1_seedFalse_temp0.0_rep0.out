Looking at this statement, I can see it describes tissue processing and preparation procedures for prostate samples, with mentions of potential assessment plans. However, it does not contain any actual diagnostic findings or results.

Key observations:
- The text discusses sample preparation and processing procedures
- It mentions that Gleason grades "between 3 to 5" might be assessed, but this is speculative language about what could be found, not actual findings
- It refers to future assessment by resident candidates and a pending consensus report
- No actual malignancy determination or Gleason grading results are reported

Since this is a preliminary/preparatory statement without diagnostic conclusions:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
