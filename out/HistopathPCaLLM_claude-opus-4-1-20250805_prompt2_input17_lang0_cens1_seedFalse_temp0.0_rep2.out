Looking at this statement, I can see it describes tissue processing and preparation procedures, with mentions of potential assessment plans and educational activities. However, it does not contain any actual diagnostic findings or results.

Key observations:
- The text discusses sample preparation and processing procedures
- It mentions potential assessment of Gleason grades "between 3 to 5" but this is hypothetical/prospective, not an actual finding
- It refers to future assessment by resident candidates in a course session
- No actual malignancy determination or Gleason grading is reported
- The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP based on the description)

Since this is a preliminary/preparatory statement without actual diagnostic results, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
