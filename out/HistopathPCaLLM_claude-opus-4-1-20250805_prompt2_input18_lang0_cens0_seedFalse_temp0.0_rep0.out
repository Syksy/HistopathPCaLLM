Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" which refers to a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure where tissue is shaved/chipped from the prostate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma" and mentions "neoplastic" tissue, confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Since Gleason grade 3 represents 60% (the major component), and the sum is 7, the minor component must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7.
