Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "standard prostate related procedures" and "12 tissue batches" which suggests a biopsy procedure (multiple tissue batches/cores are typical for biopsies).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates ">95% of material appears benign" and mentions a "suspicious focus" that is "too small to properly assign a grade group." This describes atypical findings that are suspicious but not definitively malignant - there is no confirmed cancer diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group," so no Gleason grade can be determined.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
