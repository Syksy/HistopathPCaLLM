Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data from the most severe lesion (Sample 4, which contains adenocarcinoma):

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text explicitly states these are "targeted prostate biopsies"
- **Malignancy**: "yes" - Sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma
- **Gleason**: "3+4=7" - Sample 4 shows Gleason 3 (approximately 90%, making it the major component) and Gleason 4 (10%, making it the minor component), following the convention of major+minor=sum
