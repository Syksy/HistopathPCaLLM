Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes samples 1-3 as either unrepresentative or benign. Sample 4 is described as having "cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue" but it's explicitly stated as "uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)." The quality control suggests verification is needed before proceeding. Since there is no definitive malignant tumor finding reported, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, and since there are no confirmed malignant findings, this is "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
