Looking at this histopathological statement:

The text mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, RP, or TURP. The statement indicates that results are "inconclusive" and "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings."

Since the malignancy status is explicitly stated as inconclusive and requiring additional inspection, and no definitive Gleason grade is reported, this should be structured as:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
