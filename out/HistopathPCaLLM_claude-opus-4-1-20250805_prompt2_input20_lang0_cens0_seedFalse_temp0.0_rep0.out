Based on the provided histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy resection" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. **Malignancy**: Adenocarcinoma is clearly reported in multiple locations
3. **Gleason grade**: Two lesions are described - apex with Gleason 3+4 and basis with Gleason 4+4. Since the basis lesion with 4+4=8 is more severe than the apex lesion with 3+4=7, I should report the most severe lesion.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
