Based on the histopathological statement provided, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy/prostatectomy resection)
- Malignancy is "yes" (adenocarcinoma is present)
- The most severe Gleason grade reported is 4+4 (from the basis), which is more severe than the 3+4 found at the apex
