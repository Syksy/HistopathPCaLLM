Looking at this statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into "six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." This anatomical description (apex, middle, basis) and the systematic sampling pattern suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region" and mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found." This indicates that no malignancy was definitively identified in the current examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was confirmed (only hypothetical scenarios discussed), no Gleason grade can be reported.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
