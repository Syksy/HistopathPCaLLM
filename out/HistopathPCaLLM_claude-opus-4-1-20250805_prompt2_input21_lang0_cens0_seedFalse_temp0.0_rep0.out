Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" and "shavings" indicate this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "poorly differentiated growth," "tumor-like tissue," and Gleason grading, clearly indicating malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which translates to 5+4=9
