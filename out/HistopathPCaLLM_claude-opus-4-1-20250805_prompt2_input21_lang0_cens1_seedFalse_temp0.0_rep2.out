Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "extracted prostate material" and "fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece" which suggests this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this typically produces multiple small fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not provide a definitive diagnosis. It mentions technical issues ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment") and indicates that the material needs quality control and will be revisited. No clear malignant or benign diagnosis is given.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported since no definitive malignant diagnosis has been made.
