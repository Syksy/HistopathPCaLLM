Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies" - this is a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The left side shows "carcinoma tissue structures" with Gleason scores, indicating malignant tumor findings. Even though the right side is benign, we report based on the most severe lesion (left side).

3. **Gleason grade**: The left side exhibits "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which indicates the primary pattern is 3 and secondary pattern is 4, giving us 3+4=7.
