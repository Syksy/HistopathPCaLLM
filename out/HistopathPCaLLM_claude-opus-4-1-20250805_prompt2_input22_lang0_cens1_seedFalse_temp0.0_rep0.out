Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragments, but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The fragmented nature and bilateral sampling suggests it could be biopsy cores, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to the poor quality of the samples and need for reprocessing. This means malignancy determination is not available.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Therefore, no Gleason grade can be determined.

Since the samples cannot be properly evaluated due to quality issues and potential contamination, and need reprocessing, this represents an inadequate/non-diagnostic sample.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
