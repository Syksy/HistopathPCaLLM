Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragments, but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The fragmented nature and bilateral sampling suggests it could be biopsy cores, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed" - this means they were unable to determine if malignancy is present or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" - therefore no Gleason grade can be assigned.

Since the sample type cannot be definitively determined from the text and the pathologist was unable to assess for malignancies due to sample quality issues, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
