Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma" is present, confirming malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text describes:
   - "mainly differentiation stage 4 (60%)" - this is the primary/major pattern
   - "second most common stage 5 (approx 30%)" - this is the secondary/minor pattern
   - "Tertiary grade with the least area, class 3" - tertiary pattern (not included in standard Gleason scoring)
   - Conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9"

The Gleason score follows the format major+minor=sum, which would be 4+5=9.
