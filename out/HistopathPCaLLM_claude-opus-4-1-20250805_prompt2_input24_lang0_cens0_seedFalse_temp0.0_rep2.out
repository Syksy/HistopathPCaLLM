Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly mentions "turp-chippings" which indicates a TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". While the complete grade pattern (major+minor) is not explicitly stated, a Gleason sum of 8 with mention of Gleason 4 pattern most commonly represents 4+4=8.
