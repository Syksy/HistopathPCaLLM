Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it carefully:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings" from multiple patients. Since this involves multiple sample types and multiple patients (teaching material), there's no single sample type to report.

2. **Malignancy**: The text indicates this was teaching material with "benign diagnosis" cases, where "around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". This means some cases showed malignancy, but this is teaching material from multiple patients, not a single patient's diagnostic report.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason scores are mentioned (3+3 and 3+4), these refer to multiple cases in teaching material, not a single patient's result.

This statement describes a teaching exercise using historical samples from multiple patients, not an actual histopathological report for a single patient. Therefore, it should be treated as an invalid histopathological statement.
