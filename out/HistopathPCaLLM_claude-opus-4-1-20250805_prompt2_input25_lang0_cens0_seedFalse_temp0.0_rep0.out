Based on the provided histopathological statement, I can identify this is a biopsy sample with malignant findings. The statement describes multiple samples with tumor growth showing Gleason patterns.

For the most severe lesion, Sample (1) shows Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and pattern 3 (30%), which indicates a Gleason score of 4+3=7 (pattern 4 is mentioned first and represents the primary/major pattern).
