Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "tissue sample" and "fragmented tissue material" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, the sample type cannot be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion explicitly states "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified." This means they cannot determine if there is malignancy or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported. The text mentions "Gleason differentiation patterns" could not be properly assessed, and no specific grades are provided.

Since the pathologist cannot reliably verify the presence or absence of adenocarcinoma and cannot provide definitive findings, all fields should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
