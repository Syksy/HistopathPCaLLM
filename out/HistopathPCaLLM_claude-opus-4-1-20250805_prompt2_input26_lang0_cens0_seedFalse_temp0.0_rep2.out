Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "a widely spread tumor, which spans all the way from apex to basis" - this confirms malignant tumor findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent" - this indicates Gleason 3 is the major pattern and Gleason 4 is the minor pattern, giving us 3+4=7
