Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "material originates from the prostate" with markings for apex and basis regions, which is consistent with radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen processing.

2. **Malignancy**: The text references a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" from clinical notes, indicating there was malignancy, though the current specimen is difficult to assess due to radiation therapy effects.

3. **Gleason grade**: While "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned, the text explicitly states it's unclear whether this represents 3+4=7 or 4+3=7 (GG 2 or 3), and questions if it was verified. Given this uncertainty and the inability to assess the current specimen due to radiation therapy, the Gleason grade cannot be definitively reported.
