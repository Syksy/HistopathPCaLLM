Looking at the statement: "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes. Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G, where the growth pattern was Gleason 3+3=6."

1. **Sample type**: The mention of "shavings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as this procedure produces tissue shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: "Carcinoma was histologically detected" clearly indicates malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly provides "Gleason 3+3=6"
