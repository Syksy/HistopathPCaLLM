Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "six different sites of interest" and "Region of interest" multiple times, suggesting this is from a biopsy procedure (multiple sites sampled). The language used is consistent with biopsy reporting.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "unclear differentiation staging," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes." These terms indicate abnormal findings but do NOT confirm malignant tumor. The phrase "possible pre-malignant" explicitly suggests these are not confirmed malignant findings. The material being sent for further evaluation also indicates uncertainty.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the absence of confirmed malignancy.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
