Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" with weight 40g and systematic sampling from apex through different planes. This describes a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" - so malignant tumor is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" and "Score sum 7". While the wording is slightly unclear (both portions mentioned as grade 4), given the sum is 7 and grade 4 is the major pattern, the most logical interpretation is Gleason 4+3=7.
