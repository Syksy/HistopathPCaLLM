Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material" and describes a multi-site sampling procedure (left/right, lower/middle/higher), which is characteristic of a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "tumor cells" and discusses "differentiation stages of tumor cells" and "poor differentiation and possible fusing glandular structure," indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly says "Score sum determination was not possible" and indicates samples need to be re-examined, so no Gleason score is provided.
