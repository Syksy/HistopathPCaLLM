Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material" and describes a biopsy procedure with multiple samples (A-F from different locations), indicating this is a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "non-prostatic tissue" and contamination issues, but does not report any malignant findings. The text discusses what "cannot be assessed" rather than reporting actual tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly says "Score sum determination was not possible" and indicates samples need to be re-examined, so no Gleason grade is reported.
