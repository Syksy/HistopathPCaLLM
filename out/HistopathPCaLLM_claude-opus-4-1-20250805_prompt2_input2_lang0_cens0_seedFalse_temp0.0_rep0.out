Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Since this is an autopsy sample for research (not a clinical biopsy, radical prostatectomy for treatment, or TURP), the appropriate value is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly indicates benign findings - "normal benign growth", "no abnormal growth", "no tumor growth", and the summary states tissue changes are due to "normal aging" with only inflammation noted.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grade is not applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
