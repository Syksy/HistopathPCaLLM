Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "autopsy specimen" which doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and mentions only "potential adenocarcinoma" that cannot be characterized. No definitive malignant tumor findings are reported. Therefore, this should be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in the statement. Therefore, this should be "NA".
