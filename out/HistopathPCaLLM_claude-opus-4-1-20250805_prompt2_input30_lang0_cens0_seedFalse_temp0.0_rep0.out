Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as "chippings" is characteristic terminology for TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" and discusses Gleason grading patterns, clearly indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text describes "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3" which translates to Gleason 4+3=7. While a tertiary pattern grade 5 is mentioned, standard reporting focuses on the primary and secondary patterns.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
