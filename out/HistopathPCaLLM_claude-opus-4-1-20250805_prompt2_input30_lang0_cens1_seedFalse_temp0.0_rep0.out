Looking at this statement, it describes a consultation regarding uncertain/atypical findings that could not be confirmed or denied. This is not a definitive histopathological report with clear findings.

Since:
- No specific sample type is mentioned (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- No definitive malignancy determination was made (findings were uncertain and could not be confirmed or denied)
- No Gleason grade is reported

This should be structured as:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
