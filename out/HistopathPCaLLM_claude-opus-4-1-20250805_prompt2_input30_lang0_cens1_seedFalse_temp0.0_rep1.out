Looking at this statement, it describes a consultation regarding uncertain/atypical findings that could not be confirmed or denied. There is no clear indication of:

1. Sample type - No mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP
2. Malignancy - The findings are explicitly uncertain and could not be confirmed or denied
3. Gleason grade - No Gleason scoring is mentioned

This appears to be an inconclusive consultation note rather than a definitive histopathological report.
