Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies" - these are biopsy procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes malignant findings - "Gleason 3+3=6" initially, and later "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" and "second most common differentiation pattern is 5".

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple Gleason scores are mentioned:
   - Initial: Gleason 3+3=6
   - Most recent/severe: Pattern 4 (primary) + Pattern 5 (secondary) = 4+5=9

Since only the most severe lesion should be returned, I should report the 4+5=9 finding from the second targeted biopsy.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
