Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples were taken" but doesn't specify whether these are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP samples. The context suggests diagnostic sampling but the specific type is not stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "suspicious findings" multiple times but never confirms malignancy. "Suspicious" indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive diagnosis of cancer.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned anywhere in the statement.

Since this statement lacks definitive information about sample type, doesn't confirm malignancy (only mentions suspicious findings), and contains no Gleason grading information, it should be structured as:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
