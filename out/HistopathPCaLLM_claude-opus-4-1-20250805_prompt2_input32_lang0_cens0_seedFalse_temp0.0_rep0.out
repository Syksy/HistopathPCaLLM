Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "radical prostatectomy" which corresponds to "RP"

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly describes "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" with various Gleason patterns, so malignancy is "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple Gleason patterns are mentioned (3+3, 3+4, 4+3, and 4+4). Since I need to report only the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+4 has the highest grade group, this is the most severe pattern.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
