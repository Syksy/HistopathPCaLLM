Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "Radical prostatectomy preparate" - this is an RP (radical prostatectomy) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: Yes, there are malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and describes Gleason patterns, indicating adenocarcinoma is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". Since we need to report the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+3=7 is more severe than 3+4=7 (due to the higher primary pattern), the most severe grade is 4+3=7.
