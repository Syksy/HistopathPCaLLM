Looking at the provided statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "processed samples" and "lymph nodes" and "seminal vehicles" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. The mention of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes suggests this might be from an RP, but it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but doesn't definitively state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue itself. The language is vague and non-conclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since this statement lacks clear information about the sample type, doesn't definitively confirm or deny malignancy in the prostate, and provides no Gleason grade information, it should be treated as an invalid/incomplete histopathological statement.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
