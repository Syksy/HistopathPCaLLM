Looking at the provided statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "processed samples" and "lymph nodes" and "seminal vehicles" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. The mention of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes suggests this might be from an RP, but it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles [vesicles]" and mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" - but "possibly abnormal" is not a definitive malignant finding. There's no clear statement about malignancy in the prostate itself.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since this statement lacks clear information about the sample type, definitive malignancy status, and Gleason grading, it should be treated as an incomplete or non-diagnostic statement.

  "Gleason": "NA"
