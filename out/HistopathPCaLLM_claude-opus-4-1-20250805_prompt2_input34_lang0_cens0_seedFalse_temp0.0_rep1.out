Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "resection weighing 7.5gr" - this appears to be a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the weight and description of resection.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities" - clearly indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade to report.
