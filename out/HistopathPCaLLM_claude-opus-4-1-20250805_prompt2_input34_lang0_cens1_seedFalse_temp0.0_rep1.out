Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "six tissue casettes" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The weight and processing suggest it could be TURP tissue, but without explicit mention, I cannot determine the sample type definitively.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and notes that "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely meaning prostatic carcinoma). The mention of hyperplastic tissue and inflammation without any mention of carcinoma or adenocarcinoma indicates this is a benign finding.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this appears to be a benign finding with no malignancy reported, there would be no Gleason grade.
