Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "prepared into six tissue casettes" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The weight and processing suggest it could be TURP tissue, but without explicit mention, I cannot determine the sample type definitively.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which indicates benign findings. The phrase "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (though incomplete) suggests no malignancy. The cribriform structures mentioned appear to be in the context of benign hyperplasia rather than carcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this appears to be a benign finding (hyperplasia with inflammation), no Gleason grade would be assigned.
