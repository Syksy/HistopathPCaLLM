Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma" - so no malignant tumor was found
3. **Gleason grade**: Since there is no malignancy (only PIN changes and hyperplasia mentioned), there is no Gleason grade to report

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",

  "Gleason": "NA"
}
