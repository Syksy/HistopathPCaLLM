Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma" - so no malignant tumor was found
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (no carcinoma), there is no Gleason grade to report

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
