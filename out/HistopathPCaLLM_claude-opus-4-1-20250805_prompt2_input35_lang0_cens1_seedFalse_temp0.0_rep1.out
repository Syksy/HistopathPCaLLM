Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe" without specifying the collection method. This appears to be describing prostate tissue but doesn't explicitly state "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "high-grade PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and "hyperplasia". PIN is a precancerous condition but is not malignant carcinoma itself. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor is reported, there would be no Gleason grade.
