Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" which indicates a large tissue specimen consistent with either radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP. Given the size and weight, this appears to be a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity or inflammation" - clearly indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there is no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable.
