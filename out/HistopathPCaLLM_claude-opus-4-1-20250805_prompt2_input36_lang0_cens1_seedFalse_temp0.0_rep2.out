Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably."

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of "8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes" and "sample size and weight" suggests tissue processing but doesn't specify the procedure type.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings mention "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" - both are benign conditions (hyperplasia is non-malignant tissue growth). No malignant findings are reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not applicable.
