Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "7g of electrosection chippings" which indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this produces tissue chips/chippings.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings indicate "hyperplasia" which is a benign condition (enlargement of the prostate). There is no mention of carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or any malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (hyperplasia), there is no Gleason grade to report.
