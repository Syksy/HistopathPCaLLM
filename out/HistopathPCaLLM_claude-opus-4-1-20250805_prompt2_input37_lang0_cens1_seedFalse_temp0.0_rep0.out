Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Less than half of the total sample material preparated. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents. Minor inflammation in places. Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week."

This appears to be an incomplete examination report where:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No malignant findings are reported (only benign findings like nodular gland components and inflammation are mentioned)
3. No Gleason grade is reported
4. The examination is incomplete and will continue

Since the examination is incomplete and no definitive findings regarding malignancy are reported, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
