Looking at this histopathological statement:

The text describes prostate tissue examination with "partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation." However, it explicitly states that "Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week."

Key observations:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (no clear indication of biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. No malignant findings are reported - only benign findings (nodular glandcomponents and inflammation)
3. No Gleason grade is mentioned
4. The examination is incomplete

Since the examination is incomplete and no definitive diagnosis has been made, and the sample type cannot be determined from the text:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
