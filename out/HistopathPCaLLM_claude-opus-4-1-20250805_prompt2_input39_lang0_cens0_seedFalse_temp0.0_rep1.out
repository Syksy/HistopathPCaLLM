Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "A prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly describes "a tumor with 3 foci" and mentions Gleason grading, confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7." Since Gleason 3 is identified as the major (primary) pattern, the grade should be 3+4=7.
