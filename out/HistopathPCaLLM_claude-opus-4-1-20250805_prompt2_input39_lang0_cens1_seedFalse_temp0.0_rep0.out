Looking at this statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "slices extracted" and "remaining tissue run according to normal routine" which suggests a tissue sample, but doesn't clearly specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, the sample type cannot be definitively determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings," indicating that the presence of malignancy cannot be determined.

3. **Gleason score**: The statement clearly states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

Since the findings are inconclusive and cannot determine malignancy or Gleason score, here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
