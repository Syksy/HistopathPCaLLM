Looking at this statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "slices extracted" and "remaining tissue run according to normal routine" which suggests a tissue sample, but doesn't clearly specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings" - indicating uncertainty about malignancy.

3. **Gleason score**: The statement clearly states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

Since the malignancy status is uncertain and cannot be determined from the statement, and the Gleason score cannot be assessed, the appropriate structured response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
