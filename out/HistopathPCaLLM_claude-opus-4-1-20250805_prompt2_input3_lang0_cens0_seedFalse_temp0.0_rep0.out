Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" which is characteristic terminology for TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found" - this is a benign finding
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign specimen with no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable
