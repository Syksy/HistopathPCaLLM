Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which suggests a substantial tissue volume typical of TURP or prostatectomy procedures rather than a biopsy. However, without explicit mention of the procedure type, I cannot definitively determine if this is "RP" or "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This means malignancy could not be assessed.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no conclusive findings could be derived and malignancy was not determined, no Gleason grade can be reported.
