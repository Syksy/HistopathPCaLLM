Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving material" which indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this is the typical terminology used for TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia", confirming no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable.
