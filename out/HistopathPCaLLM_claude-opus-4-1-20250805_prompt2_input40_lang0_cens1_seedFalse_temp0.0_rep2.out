Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Examined material weights 8.9" which suggests tissue examination, but doesn't explicitly state if it's from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "hyperplastic prostate" and "inflammation" but states "possibly something else" and "Further examination is needed." There is no definitive malignant tumor finding reported. Therefore: "no"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is definitively reported, no Gleason grade is provided. Therefore: "NA"
