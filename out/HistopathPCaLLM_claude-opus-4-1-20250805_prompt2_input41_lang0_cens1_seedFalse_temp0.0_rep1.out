Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate. One sample showed little chronic inflammation, two samples showed atrophied glands and chronic inflammation. Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate" but doesn't specify the collection method (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates uncertainty - "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not" - meaning no definitive malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and since there are no confirmed malignant findings, this would be NA
