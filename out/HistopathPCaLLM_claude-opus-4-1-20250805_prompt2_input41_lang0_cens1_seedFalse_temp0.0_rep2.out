Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate. One sample showed little chronic inflammation, two samples showed atrophied glands and chronic inflammation. Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "samples collected from left and right lobes of prostate" which indicates a biopsy procedure
2. Malignancy: The statement describes chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, but explicitly states it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not" - indicating no definitive malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is reported, there is no Gleason grade
