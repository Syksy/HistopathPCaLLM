Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy specimen (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The presence of Gleason grades and the description of tumor differentiation patterns clearly indicates malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly provides "score 7 (4+3)" with Gleason grade 4 being predominant and a small amount of Gleason 3
