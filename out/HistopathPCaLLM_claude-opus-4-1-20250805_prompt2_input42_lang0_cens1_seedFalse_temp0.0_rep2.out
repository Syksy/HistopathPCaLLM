Looking at the statement "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared. Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined."

This appears to be a pathological statement, but:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified (just "prostate sample")
2. The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain - they cannot determine if it's cancer or inflammation
3. No Gleason grade is reported

Since the findings are inconclusive and cannot determine malignancy, I'll structure this as:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
