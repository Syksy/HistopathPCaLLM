Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" and "30g" of material, which is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure where tissue chips are obtained.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material" - this is a benign finding.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not applicable.
