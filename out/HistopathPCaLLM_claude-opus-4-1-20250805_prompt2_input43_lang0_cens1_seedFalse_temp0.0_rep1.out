Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The mention of "30g prostate samples" suggests this is likely a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen based on the weight and description
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" - this means malignancy cannot be determined
3. Gleason: Since no malignancy is confirmed, Gleason grade is not applicable
