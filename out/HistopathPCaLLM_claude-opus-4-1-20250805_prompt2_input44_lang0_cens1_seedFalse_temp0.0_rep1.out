Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" and later references "Earlier biopsies" - this suggests the current sample is a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" - indicating no malignant tumor findings in the current sample.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is found in this sample, there is no Gleason grade to report.
