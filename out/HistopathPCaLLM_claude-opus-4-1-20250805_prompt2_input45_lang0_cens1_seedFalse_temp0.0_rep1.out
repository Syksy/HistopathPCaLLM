Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Seminal vesicles in sections O and P" and "lymph nodes in the area" which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as these structures are examined in RP but not in biopsies or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "No metastases seen in lymph nodes" and mentions "Negative marginals, capsel intact" but does not clearly state whether malignant tumor was found in the prostate tissue itself. The phrase "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "Further inspection is needed" suggests the diagnosis is inconclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement.

Given the inconclusive nature of the findings and the need for further inspection, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
