Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure where tissue is removed in small chips/shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" - indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (no cancer), there is no Gleason grade to report.
