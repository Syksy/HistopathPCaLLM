Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate material" without specifying the exact procedure type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," indicating that malignancy could not be determined. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be assessed and no Gleason grading is mentioned, this is "NA".
