Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate material" without specifying if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, the sample type cannot be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," indicating that malignancy could not be determined from this examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grade can be provided.
