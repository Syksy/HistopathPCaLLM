Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "examined sample material from the right and the left" and "total amount of prostatic material" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Therefore, sample type cannot be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This indicates the pathologist could not determine if malignancy was present.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
