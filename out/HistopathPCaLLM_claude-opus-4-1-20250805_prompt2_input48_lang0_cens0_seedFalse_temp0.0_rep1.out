Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" with systematic sampling of apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles - this is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" - malignant tumor is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement describes two tumor foci, with the second focus being more severe (containing Gleason 5 pattern). The summary explicitly states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since Gleason 9 can only be 4+5=9 or 5+4=9, and the second focus is described as having Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small portion of Gleason 4, this indicates 5+4=9.
