Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" and describes systematic sampling of apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles, which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" - malignant tumor is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The summary explicitly states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The second focus (which appears to be the most severe lesion) is described as having "Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4", which would correspond to 5+4=9.
