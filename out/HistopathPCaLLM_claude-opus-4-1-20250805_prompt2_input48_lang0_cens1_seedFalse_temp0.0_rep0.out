Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this indicates autopsy specimens, which doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns...for educational purposes" but explicitly states this is educational material from autopsies and "not used to derive differentiation scores". There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. This should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly says "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)", indicating no Gleason grading was performed. This should be "NA".
