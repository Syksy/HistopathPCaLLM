Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP), so this is "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "histological changes" and mentions it's for educational purposes. It explicitly states they are "unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals" and that "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)". There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so this is "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that Gleason scores are not being derived from this material, so this is "NA"
