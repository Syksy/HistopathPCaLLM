Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP), so this is "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "histological changes" and "interesting patterns" for educational purposes from autopsy material. It explicitly states these findings are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)". This appears to be educational/demonstration material rather than a diagnostic report of malignancy, so this is "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that Gleason scores are not being derived from this material ("not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)"), so this is "NA"
