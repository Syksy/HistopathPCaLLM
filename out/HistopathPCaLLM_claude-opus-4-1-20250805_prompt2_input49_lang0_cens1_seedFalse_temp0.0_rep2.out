Looking at this statement, I can analyze it as follows:

1. The text mentions "prostate samples" and "8 glasses" which suggests microscopic examination of prostate tissue, but doesn't specify the exact sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)

2. The statement indicates "changes that warrant further investigation" but explicitly states that "assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations" - this means no definitive diagnosis of malignancy can be made

3. Since no malignancy is confirmed and the assessment is incomplete, no Gleason grade can be determined

This appears to be an inconclusive/incomplete pathological examination rather than a definitive histopathological statement.
