Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "benign prostate tissue is observed" and "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" - indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no adenocarcinoma, there would be no Gleason grade to report.
