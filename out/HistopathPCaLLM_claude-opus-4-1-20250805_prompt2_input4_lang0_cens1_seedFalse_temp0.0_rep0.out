Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sampling sites" and appears to describe a biopsy procedure with multiple samples from standard locations. This indicates a **biopsy**.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no notable atypic patterns are present" and mentions that the material is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma. This indicates **no** malignant findings were detected.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not applicable (**NA**).
