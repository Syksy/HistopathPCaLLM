Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "radical prostatectomy" - this is an RP (radical prostatectomy) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed" - this confirms malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Two lesions are described:
   - Macro A: Gleason 4+3
   - Macro B: Gleason 4+5 (sum of 9)
   
   Since Macro B has the higher Gleason sum (9 vs 7), it represents the most severe lesion.
