Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "enlargened prostate" and samples from "apex and basis" which are typical anatomical references for a whole prostate specimen. This indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred" and refers to "suspected higher sum" being sent for colleague inspection. While Gleason grading is mentioned (which is specific to prostate cancer), no definitive malignant findings are reported in this statement.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." Therefore, no Gleason grade can be determined from this statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
