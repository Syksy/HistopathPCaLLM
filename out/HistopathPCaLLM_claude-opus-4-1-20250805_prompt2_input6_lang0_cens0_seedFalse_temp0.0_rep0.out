Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue cassettes" which is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure where tissue chips are obtained.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia" - clearly indicating no malignancy found.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (no malignancy), Gleason grade is not applicable.
