Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving chips" which are typical of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedures where tissue is shaved/chipped away.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "benign prostate hyperplasia" and describes "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" with no mention of malignancy or carcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (no malignancy), Gleason grading is not applicable.
