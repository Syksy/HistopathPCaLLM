Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material, but doesn't specify if it's RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP. Given the ambiguity, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and mentions the results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). No malignancy is reported, but the examination is incomplete. Since the findings are inconclusive rather than definitively benign, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and given the inconclusive nature of the examination, this is "NA".
