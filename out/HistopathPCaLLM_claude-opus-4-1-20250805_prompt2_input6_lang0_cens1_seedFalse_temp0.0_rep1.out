Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material, but doesn't specify if it's from radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP. Given the ambiguity, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and mentions the results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). No malignancy is reported, but the examination was incomplete. Since no malignancy was found in what could be examined, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and this would be "NA" for a benign/inconclusive finding.
