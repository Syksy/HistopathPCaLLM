Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The pathologist describes "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" but explicitly states "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." This indicates suspicion but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Since the allowed values are only "yes", "no", or "NA", and this is inconclusive/suspicious but not confirmed, the most appropriate answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement, which is consistent with the lack of definitive malignant diagnosis.
