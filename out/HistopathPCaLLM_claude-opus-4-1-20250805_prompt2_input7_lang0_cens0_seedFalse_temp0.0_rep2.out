Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The pathologist describes "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" but explicitly states "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." This indicates suspicion but no definitive malignant diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement.

Since there is no confirmed malignancy (only suspicion), the structured result should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
