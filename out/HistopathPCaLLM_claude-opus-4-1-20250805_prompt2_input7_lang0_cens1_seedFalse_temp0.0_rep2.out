Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, the sample type cannot be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but explicitly states "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material." This indicates an inconclusive finding rather than a definitive malignant diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, and given that no definitive malignant diagnosis was made, no Gleason score would be applicable.
