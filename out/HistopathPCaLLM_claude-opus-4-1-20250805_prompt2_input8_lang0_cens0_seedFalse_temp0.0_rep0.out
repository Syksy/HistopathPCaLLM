Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data from the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

The statement describes a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen with malignant tumor findings. The highest Gleason grade reported is 4+3=7, which represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the report.
