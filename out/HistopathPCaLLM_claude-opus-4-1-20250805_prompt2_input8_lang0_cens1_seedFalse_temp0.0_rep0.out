Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples with indices suggests this could be a biopsy series, but it's not definitively stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement is ambiguous. While samples 1 and 2 are "completely free of malignant findings," sample 3 shows "potentially interesting properties" and mentions "Gleason patterns" which typically indicate malignancy. However, the Gleason scores are missing ("empty fields ? and ?"), and there's only mention of "PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) which is not invasive cancer. The lack of clear malignant diagnosis makes this uncertain.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly says "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This clearly indicates the Gleason score is not available.

Given the ambiguous nature of the statement and missing critical information:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
