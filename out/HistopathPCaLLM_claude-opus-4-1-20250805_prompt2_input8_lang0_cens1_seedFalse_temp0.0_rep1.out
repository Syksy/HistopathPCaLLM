Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples with indices suggests this could be a biopsy series, but it's not definitively stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason patterns" and discusses grades, which are only used for malignant findings. Although samples 1 and 2 are "completely free of malignant findings," sample 3 appears to have malignant findings given the discussion of Gleason patterns.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and mentions "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This indicates the Gleason score is not available.

Since we need to report on the most severe lesion (sample 3 in this case), and while there appears to be malignancy, the Gleason score is explicitly stated as missing/not reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
