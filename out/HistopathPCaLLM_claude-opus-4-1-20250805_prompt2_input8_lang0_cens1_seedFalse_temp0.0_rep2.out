Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Suspicion of PIN-changes" (PIN = Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia, which is a precancerous condition, not malignant cancer). It also states samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings." There's no clear confirmation of malignancy in sample 3. Therefore: "no"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor" - this indicates no actual Gleason score was reported. Therefore: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
