Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "electrosection shavings" and describes a procedure consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), where tissue shavings are obtained through electrosection.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings are observed" and concludes with "benign hyperplasia."

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, no Gleason grade is applicable.
