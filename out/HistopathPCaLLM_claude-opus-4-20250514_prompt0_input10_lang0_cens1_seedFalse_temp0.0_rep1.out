Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify whether they are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text discusses "normal basal cells" and focuses on technical issues with immunological staining panels. There is no mention of malignant findings, carcinoma, or cancer.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, there would be no Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
