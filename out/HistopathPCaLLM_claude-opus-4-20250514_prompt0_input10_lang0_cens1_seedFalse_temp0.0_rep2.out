Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify whether they are biopsy, RP, or TURP samples.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - The text mentions "normal basal cells were observed" and discusses staining issues, but there is no mention of malignant findings.
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since there are no malignant findings reported, Gleason grade is not applicable.
