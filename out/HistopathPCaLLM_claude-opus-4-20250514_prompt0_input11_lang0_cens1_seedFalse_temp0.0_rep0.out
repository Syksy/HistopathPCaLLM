Looking at this histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "weight(s)" and inspection of "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which suggests a whole prostate specimen rather than a biopsy. This is most consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and references "Gleason scores... score 4 and score 3," which indicates the presence of malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text specifically mentions "score 4 and score 3" as the Gleason scores present. Following the standard convention where the primary (most prevalent) pattern is listed first, this would be reported as 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
