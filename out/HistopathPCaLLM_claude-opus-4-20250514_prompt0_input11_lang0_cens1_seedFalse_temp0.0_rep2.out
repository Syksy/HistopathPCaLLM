Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (no reference to biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings are present as indicated by the mention of Gleason scores and tubular structures of varying differentiation
3. The statement mentions "Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3" - following the convention of reporting the most prevalent pattern first, this would be 4+3=7
