Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and references multiple samples (sample B), which is consistent with prostate biopsy procedures.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that require "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." Since the findings are inconclusive and pending consultation, a definitive yes/no determination cannot be made.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, and given the inconclusive nature of the findings, no grade can be assigned.
