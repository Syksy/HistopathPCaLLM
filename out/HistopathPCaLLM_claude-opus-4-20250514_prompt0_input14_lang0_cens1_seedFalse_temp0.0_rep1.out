Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP specimen
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - While there are mentions of "special patterns of cell growth" and a reference to another "Gleason 7 score patient," there is no definitive statement about whether malignant tumor was found in this patient
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported for this patient; the text only mentions that further investigation is needed before making any statements
