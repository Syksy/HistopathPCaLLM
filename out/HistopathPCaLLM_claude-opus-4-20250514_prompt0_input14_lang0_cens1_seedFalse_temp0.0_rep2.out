Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - While there are mentions of "special patterns of cell growth" and a reference to another "Gleason 7 score patient," the text explicitly states that "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted" before making definitive statements
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No specific Gleason grade is reported for this patient's tissue, only a comparison to another patient with Gleason 7
