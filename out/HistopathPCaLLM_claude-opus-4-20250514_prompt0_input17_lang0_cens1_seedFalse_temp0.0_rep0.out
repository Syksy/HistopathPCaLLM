Based on the provided text, this appears to be a preliminary report describing sample preparation and processing, but it does not contain definitive diagnostic findings. The text mentions that the actual assessment will be performed by resident candidates in a future course session.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- Sample type cannot be determined from the text (it mentions prostate tissue but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- No definitive malignant findings are reported (the text only mentions that Gleason grades 3-5 might be assessed or the material might be "fully healthy")
- No actual Gleason grade is reported (only mentions the possibility of assessing grades between 3-5)
