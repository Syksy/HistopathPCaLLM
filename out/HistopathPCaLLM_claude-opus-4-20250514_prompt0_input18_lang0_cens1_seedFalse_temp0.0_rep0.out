Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Rationale:
- **sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "12 tissue batches" which is consistent with standard prostate biopsy procedures
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - While there is a suspicious area that might warrant further investigation, no definitive malignant findings are reported. The statement indicates the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group" and >95% appears benign
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no malignant tumor is definitively identified, no Gleason grade can be assigned
