Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP.
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - Sample 4 shows abnormal features that could "possibly" be malignant, but the report indicates uncertainty and the need for verification before proceeding with further analysis.
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is reported as the diagnosis is uncertain and further verification is needed.
