Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "4 batches" of samples which is typical for prostate biopsies
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The findings are inconclusive as sample 4 shows abnormal architecture but requires verification due to possible lab error/tissue mixing
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as the malignancy status is uncertain and pending further verification
