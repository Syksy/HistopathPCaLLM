Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "extracted prostate material" and "fragments" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates that the material quality is poor with "dissolved nuclei" and "technical noise" that prevents proper assessment. The pathologist cannot determine if malignant findings are present due to these technical issues.
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined due to poor tissue quality, no Gleason grade can be assigned. The statement indicates the material needs to be revisited after quality control consultation.
