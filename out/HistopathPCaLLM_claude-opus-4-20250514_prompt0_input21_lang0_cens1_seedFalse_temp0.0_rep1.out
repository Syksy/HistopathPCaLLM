Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **sample_type**: "TURP" - The description of "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece" is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - Cannot be determined due to poor tissue quality and technical issues preventing proper assessment
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Cannot be assigned as the material quality is too poor for proper evaluation and the case requires revisiting after quality control
