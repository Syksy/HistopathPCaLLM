Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a sample that needs to be reprocessed and does not provide definitive information about:
- The specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- Confirmed malignant findings (only mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior incomplete report)
- A definitive Gleason grade (the potential finding is incomplete and needs validation)

Since the statement indicates the sample requires reprocessing to validate initial suspicions, no conclusive pathological findings can be extracted.
