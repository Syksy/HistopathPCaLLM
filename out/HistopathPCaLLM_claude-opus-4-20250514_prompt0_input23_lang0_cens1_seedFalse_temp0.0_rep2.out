Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text describes a sample that needs to be reprocessed and does not provide definitive information about:
- The specific sample type (though it mentions "prepared sample set" and "macro sections", it doesn't clearly indicate if this is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- Whether malignant tumor findings were confirmed (only mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior incomplete report)
- A definitive Gleason grade (the potential finding is incomplete and needs validation)

Since the conclusion states the sample needs to be reprocessed to validate initial suspicions, no definitive results can be extracted from this statement.
