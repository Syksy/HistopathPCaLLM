Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" because multiple sample types are mentioned (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and shavings) without specifying which type contained the most severe lesion
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" because some cases were upgraded from benign to malignant (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4)
- **gleason_grade**: "3+4=7" as this represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the text (some cases were upgraded to "at most 3+4")
