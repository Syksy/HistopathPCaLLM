Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The description of multiple numbered samples with fragmented tissue and small dimensions (0.5-1mm) is consistent with biopsy samples
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The conclusion explicitly states that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified"
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be confirmed and Gleason differentiation patterns could not be reliably assessed, no Gleason grade can be assigned
