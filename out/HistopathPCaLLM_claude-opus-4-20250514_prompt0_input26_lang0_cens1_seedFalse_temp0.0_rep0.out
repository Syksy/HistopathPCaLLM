```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The structured data extraction results in "NA" for all fields because:

1. **Sample type**: While the text mentions "prostate" material with apex and basis samples, it doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant findings**: The text mentions a clinical note about possible Gleason sum 7, but the pathologist cannot confirm malignant findings due to radiation therapy effects making the tissue "very difficult to assess."

3. **Gleason grade**: Although "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, the pathologist explicitly states it is "unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified." The radiation therapy has compromised the ability to make a definitive Gleason grade assessment.
