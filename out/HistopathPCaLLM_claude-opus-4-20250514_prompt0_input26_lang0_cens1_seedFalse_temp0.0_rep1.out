{

  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The structured data extraction results in "NA" for all fields because:

1. **Original sample type**: The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. It only mentions "studied material originates from the prostate" without specifying the collection method.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: While clinical notes mention a possible Gleason sum, the pathologist cannot confirm malignant findings due to radiation therapy effects making the tissue "very difficult to assess." The histopathology cannot be reasonably used for assessment.

3. **Gleason grade**: Although "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, the pathologist explicitly states it's unclear if this was verified and cannot determine if it would be GG 2 or 3. Due to the radiation therapy effects, no definitive Gleason grade can be assigned.
