Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text mentions "tumor differentiation" and discusses Gleason scoring, indicating malignant findings are present
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - While Gleason score 3 is mentioned as "maybe" being seen in small quantities, there is no definitive Gleason grade reported in the standard "major+minor=sum" format
