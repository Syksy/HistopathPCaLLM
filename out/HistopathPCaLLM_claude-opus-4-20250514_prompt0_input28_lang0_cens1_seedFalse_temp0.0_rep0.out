Based on the provided histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sample type**: The examination mentions "six different sites of interest" which is typical of a prostate biopsy procedure
- **Malignant findings**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes," but does not definitively report malignant tumor findings. The tissue requires further evaluation
- **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor is definitively diagnosed, Gleason grading is not applicable (NA)
