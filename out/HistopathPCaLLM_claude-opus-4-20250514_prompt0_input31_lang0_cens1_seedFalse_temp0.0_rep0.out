Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "samples were taken" after imaging due to suspicious symptoms, which indicates a biopsy procedure.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The text only mentions "suspicious findings" but does not definitively state whether malignant tumors were found. The findings are described as suspicious but inconclusive.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the text, and since the findings are only described as "suspicious" without confirmation of malignancy, no Gleason grade would be assigned.
