Based on the provided text, I'll structure the data according to your requirements:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "RP" - The text mentions "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles" being examined, which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The text does not explicitly state whether malignant tumor was found or not in the prostate tissue itself.
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in this statement.
