Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - The text explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and mentions only "possibly abnormal findings" in lymph nodes, which doesn't confirm malignancy
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no malignant findings are reported, no Gleason grade would be assigned
