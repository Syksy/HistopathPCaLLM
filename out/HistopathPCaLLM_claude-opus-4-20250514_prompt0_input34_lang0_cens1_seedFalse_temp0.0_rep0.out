Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" based on the weight (7.5g) and description of tissue processing, which is typical for TURP specimens
- Malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely meaning prostatic carcinoma) and describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation"
- Gleason grade is "NA" because this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported
