Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is TURP based on the weight (7.5g) and description of tissue processing
- No malignant findings are indicated - the statement mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely incomplete sentence for prostatic carcinoma) and describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation"
- Gleason grade is NA because this is a benign finding
