Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type: The statement mentions "samples from left and right lobe" which indicates this is a biopsy (multiple samples from different lobes)
- Malignant findings: No malignant tumor is reported. The findings include high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) which is a precancerous condition but not malignant, and hyperplasia which is benign
- Gleason grade: NA because no malignant tumor was found (Gleason grading only applies to adenocarcinoma)
