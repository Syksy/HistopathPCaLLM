Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. Sample type is "NA" because the statement doesn't clearly indicate whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP
2. Malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement only mentions hyperplasia (both nodular and epithelial), which is benign
3. Gleason grade is "NA" because this is a benign finding (hyperplasia) with no malignancy reported
