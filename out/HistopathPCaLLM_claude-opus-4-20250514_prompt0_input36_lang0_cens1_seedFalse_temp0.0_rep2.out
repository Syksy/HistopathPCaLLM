Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is not explicitly mentioned (could be TURP based on the description of nodular hyperplasia, but this is not definitively stated)
- The findings describe benign conditions (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia) with no mention of malignancy
- Gleason grade is NA because this is a benign finding
