Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The statement does not specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The examination is incomplete and no definitive findings regarding malignancy are reported
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned as the examination is not yet complete
