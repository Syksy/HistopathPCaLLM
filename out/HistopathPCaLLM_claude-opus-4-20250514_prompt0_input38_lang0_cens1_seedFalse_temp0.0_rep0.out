Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "no" - The findings only mention hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, which are benign conditions with no mention of malignancy
3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no malignant findings were reported, Gleason grading is not applicable
