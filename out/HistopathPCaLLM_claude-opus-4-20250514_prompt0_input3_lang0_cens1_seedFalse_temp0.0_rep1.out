Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **original_sample_type**: "TURP" - The mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" suggests this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen, as this procedure typically yields larger tissue volumes compared to biopsies
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates that "nothing conclusive may be derived" due to burn artifacts preventing detailed examination
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since no conclusive findings could be made and no malignancy was identified, Gleason grading is not applicable
