Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **sample_type**: "TURP" - The weight (8.9g) and processing method (8 cassettes) are consistent with a TURP specimen
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The report is inconclusive, mentioning only hyperplasia and inflammation with need for further examination
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade can be assigned as no definitive malignancy is reported
