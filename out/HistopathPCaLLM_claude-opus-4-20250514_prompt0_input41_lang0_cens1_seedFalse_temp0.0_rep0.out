Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "biopsy" as the statement mentions samples collected from left and right lobes
- Malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement indicates uncertainty about cancer-related changes and only mentions chronic inflammation and atrophied glands
- Gleason grade is "NA" as no malignant findings were reported
