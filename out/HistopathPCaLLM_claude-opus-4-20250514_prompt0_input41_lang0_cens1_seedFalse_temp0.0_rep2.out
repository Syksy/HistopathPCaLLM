Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. The statement mentions "samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate" which indicates this is a biopsy procedure
2. The findings describe chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, with no definitive cancer diagnosis ("Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not")
3. Since no malignant findings are reported, the Gleason grade is "NA"
