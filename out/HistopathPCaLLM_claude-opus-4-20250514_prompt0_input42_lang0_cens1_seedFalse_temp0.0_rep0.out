```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text indicates:
1. Sample type is unclear (mentions "Prostate sample" but doesn't specify if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy cannot be determined (explicitly states "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined")
3. No Gleason grade is reported since malignancy is not confirmed
