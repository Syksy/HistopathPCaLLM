```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The text indicates:
1. Sample type is unclear - it mentions "Prostate sample" but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP
2. Malignancy is uncertain - the text explicitly states "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined"
3. No Gleason grade is reported since malignancy cannot be confirmed
