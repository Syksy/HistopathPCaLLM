Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP specimen
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The text describes a "suspect" sample with unclear structure that requires further inspection, without definitive confirmation of malignancy
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is reported in the statement
