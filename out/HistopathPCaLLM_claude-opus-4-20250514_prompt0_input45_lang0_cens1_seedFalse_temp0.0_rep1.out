Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The text mentions "a suspect prostate sample" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement describes unclear structures and indicates that "further inspection is needed," without definitively stating whether malignant tumor was found or not
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
