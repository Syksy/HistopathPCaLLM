Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **sample_type**: "NA" - The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The pathologist explicitly states they are "not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned
