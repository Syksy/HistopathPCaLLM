Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **original_sample_type**: "NA" - The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify whether they are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP
- **malignant_tumor_findings**: "NA" - The statement indicates that findings require further investigation and assessment is not possible due to technical limitations, so malignancy cannot be determined
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
