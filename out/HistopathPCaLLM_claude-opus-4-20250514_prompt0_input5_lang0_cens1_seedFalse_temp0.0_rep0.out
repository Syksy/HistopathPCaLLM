Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "RP" - The text describes sampling from an enlarged prostate with systematic processing (left/right, apex/basis), use of dyes, and multiple indexed samples (A to H), which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy specimen processing.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "suspected higher sum," which indicates the presence of malignant tumor, even though specific grades couldn't be determined.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - The text explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating that while malignancy is present, the specific Gleason grade cannot be determined from this report.
