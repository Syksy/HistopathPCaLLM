Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
1. **original_sample_type**: "RP" - The text describes sampling from an enlarged prostate with processing of left (yellow dye) and right (green dye) sides, and samples from both apex and basis, which is consistent with radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen processing.

2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: "yes" - The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "different kind of architectures" with a "suspected higher sum," indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **gleason_grade**: "NA" - The text explicitly states that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating that a definitive Gleason grade cannot be determined from this report.
