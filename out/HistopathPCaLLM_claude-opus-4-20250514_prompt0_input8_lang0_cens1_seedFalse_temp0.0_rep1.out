Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions multiple samples with indices, which is typical for biopsy procedures
2. **Malignant findings**: "NA" - While samples 1 and 2 were confirmed "completely free of malignant findings," sample 3 (the most severe/interesting) has ambiguous findings with missing Gleason grades and only mentions "PIN-changes" (which are not malignant)
3. **Gleason grade**: "NA" - The text explicitly states that Gleason patterns have "empty fields ? and ?" with no actual grades reported
