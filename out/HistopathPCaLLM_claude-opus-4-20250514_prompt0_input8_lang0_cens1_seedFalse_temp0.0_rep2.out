Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sample type**: "biopsy" - The text mentions multiple samples with indices and describes examination of tissue samples, which is consistent with biopsy procedures.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: "NA" - While samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings," sample 3 (the most severe lesion) has ambiguous findings. The text mentions "potentially interesting properties" and discusses PIN changes (which are not malignant), but there's no clear statement about malignancy in sample 3.

3. **Gleason grade**: "NA" - Although Gleason patterns are mentioned, the actual grades are missing (shown as "empty fields ? and ?"), making it impossible to determine the grade despite the mention of "lower grade covering above 10% of the sample."
