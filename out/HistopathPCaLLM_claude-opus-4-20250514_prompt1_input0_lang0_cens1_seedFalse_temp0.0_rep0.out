Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn". This indicates that malignancy could not be determined, so this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was detected/determined, Gleason grade is "NA".
