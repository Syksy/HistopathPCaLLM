Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn." This indicates no malignant findings were detected. Therefore: "no"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore: "NA"

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
