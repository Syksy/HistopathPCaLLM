Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedures. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses technical issues with staining and mentions "normal basal cells were observed." There is no mention of adenocarcinoma, cancer, or any malignant findings. The focus is entirely on staining quality issues. Therefore, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not applicable. Therefore, this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
