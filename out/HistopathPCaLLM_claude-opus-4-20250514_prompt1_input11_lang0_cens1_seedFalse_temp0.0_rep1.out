Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "weight(s)" and inspection of "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section", which suggests this is a whole prostate specimen, likely from radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions "Gleason scores... score 4 and score 3", which indicates malignant findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text specifically mentions "score 4 and score 3" as the Gleason scores, though it notes these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material (only 5% could be investigated). Following the convention of reporting the most severe lesion with major+minor format, this would be 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
