Looking at the provided statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate" which indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "the material is classified as benign," which means no malignant tumor was found.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.
