Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement only mentions "suspected" cancer and indicates that high resolution images are still pending in the digipathology queue, so no definitive malignancy finding is reported
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement
