Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement indicates the examination is incomplete (images are still in queue) and no definitive malignancy finding is reported
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement
