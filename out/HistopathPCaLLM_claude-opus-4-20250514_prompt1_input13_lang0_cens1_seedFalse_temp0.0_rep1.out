Based on the provided statement, I'll analyze the text to extract the required structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't explicitly state the method (biopsy, RP, or TURP). Without clear indication, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B that requires "further inspection" and "consultation". However, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy stated. The findings are suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. Therefore, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the fact that no definitive malignancy is reported. This should be "NA".

  "Gleason": "NA"
