Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to it as "the specimen" with multiple samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q) being processed. It also mentions "prostate capsule border region" and "surgical margin status," which suggests this is likely from a radical prostatectomy (RP) rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," suggesting abnormal findings. However, the statement explicitly says "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted, especially before making a statement affecting any potential intervention-decisions." This indicates that no definitive diagnosis of malignancy has been made yet.

3. **Gleason grade**: While there's a reference to another patient with "Gleason 7 score," no Gleason grade is reported for this patient's specimen. The pathologist is deferring final assessment pending further investigation.
