Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that no definitive malignant findings were made. While clinical notes mention suspected adenocarcinoma, the histopathological examination could not confirm this ("representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time"). The findings need to be revised in the next examination. Therefore, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." While clinical notes mention a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this was "not based on any histopathology." Therefore, this is "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
