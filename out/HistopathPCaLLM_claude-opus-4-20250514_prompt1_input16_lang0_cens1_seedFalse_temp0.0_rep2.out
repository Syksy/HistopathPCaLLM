Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses "various grades of cell differentiation" and mentions potential "mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3)" patterns, which suggests malignant findings are present. The reference to Gleason grading patterns indicates adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: While the text references possible "3+4 or 4+3" patterns, it explicitly states that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive" and that proper grading needs to be done manually. No definitive Gleason score is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
