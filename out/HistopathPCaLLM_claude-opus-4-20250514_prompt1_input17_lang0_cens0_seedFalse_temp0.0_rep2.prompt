Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Prostatectomy preparate is processed according to the standard routine, so that right side is indicated with green and left side with yellow dye. Samples A-D from basis toward apex as macro sections, apex in samples E-F and basis G-N, and remaining N-O as seminal vehicles from both sides. Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections, with the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. Most of the findings emerge from the basis, but the apex and seminal vehicles are clear. Perineural invasion is also prominent and the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat.
