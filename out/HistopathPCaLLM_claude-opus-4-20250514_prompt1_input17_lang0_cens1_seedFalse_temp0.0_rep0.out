Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "right side of the prostate" and "left side" with samples labeled A-O, which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen where the entire prostate is sectioned and examined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates this is a preliminary report being used for educational purposes. No definitive malignant findings are reported - only that the tissue "likely allowing assessment" of Gleason grades. The actual assessment will be done by residents in a future session.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason grades "between 3 to 5" are mentioned, these are presented as possibilities to be assessed, not as confirmed findings. No actual Gleason score is reported.
