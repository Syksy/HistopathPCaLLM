Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of processing the entire prostate with right and left sides indicated differently, and multiple sections from base to apex.

2. There is no definitive statement about malignant tumor findings. The text mentions that assessment will determine if Gleason grades 3-5 are present OR if the material is "fully healthy", but no actual findings are reported yet.

3. No Gleason grade is reported - this is explicitly stated as pending assessment.

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
