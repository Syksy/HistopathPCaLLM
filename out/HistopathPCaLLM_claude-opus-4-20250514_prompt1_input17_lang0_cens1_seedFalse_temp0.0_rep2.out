Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. The sample type appears to be from a radical prostatectomy (RP) based on the description of multiple samples from different regions of the prostate (apex to base, right and left sides indicated).

2. There is no definitive statement about malignant findings - the text mentions that assessment will be done to determine if Gleason grades 3-5 are present OR if the material is "fully healthy".

3. No specific Gleason grade is reported - this is deferred to a future assessment.
