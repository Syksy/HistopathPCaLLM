Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" which indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma" and describes neoplastic tissue, so malignant tumor is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This means Gleason grade 3 is the major component (60%), and since the sum is 7, the minor component must be grade 4 (3+4=7).
