Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "standard prostate related procedures" and "12 tissue batches" which is characteristic of a systematic biopsy approach.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that >95% appears benign, with a small suspicious focus that "might contain" ISUP GG 1 or above, but it's "too small to properly assign a grade group." This indicates no definitive malignant findings at this time.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive malignancy is reported and no grade can be assigned, this would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
