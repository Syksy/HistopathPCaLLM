Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text mentions "12 tissue batches" which is consistent with standard prostate biopsy procedures
- **Malignancy**: "no" - While there is a small suspicious area (<5%), no definitive malignancy is diagnosed. The statement indicates the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group" and >95% appears benign
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is assigned because no malignancy is definitively diagnosed
