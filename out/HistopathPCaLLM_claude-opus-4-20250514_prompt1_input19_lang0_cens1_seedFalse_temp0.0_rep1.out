Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: The text mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA" is appropriate.
- **Malignancy**: Sample 4 shows abnormal architecture but the statement indicates uncertainty about whether this is truly malignant or possibly a lab error/tissue mix-up. Since there's no definitive malignant finding reported, "NA" is the most appropriate value.
- **Gleason**: No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, so "NA" is appropriate.
