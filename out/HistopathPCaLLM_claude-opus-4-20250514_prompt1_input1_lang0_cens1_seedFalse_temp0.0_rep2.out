Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't explicitly state if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific type isn't mentioned, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement indicates that "the final results appear inconclusive" and "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy". This means they couldn't definitively determine if malignant tumor was present or not, so this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings" but states results are inconclusive and additional inspection is required. No actual Gleason grade is reported, so this should be "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
