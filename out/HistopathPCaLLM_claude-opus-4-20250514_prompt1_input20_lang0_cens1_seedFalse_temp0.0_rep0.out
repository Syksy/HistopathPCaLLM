Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into "six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." This sampling pattern (apex, middle, basis) is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, where the entire prostate is sectioned systematically.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." This indicates that malignancy could not be determined from these samples.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grade can be reported. The text only mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but this is not an actual finding.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
