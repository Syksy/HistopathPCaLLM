Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for these values:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "extracted prostate material" and "fragments" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure.
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement indicates technical issues with the sample quality ("nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise", "too noisy material") that prevent proper assessment. No definitive malignant findings are reported.
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is provided, which is consistent with the inability to properly assess the tissue due to quality issues.
