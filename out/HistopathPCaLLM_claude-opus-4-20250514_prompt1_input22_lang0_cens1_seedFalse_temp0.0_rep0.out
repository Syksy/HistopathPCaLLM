Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragments with specific measurements, but doesn't explicitly state if it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies" - indicating that malignancy determination cannot be made.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and that samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" - indicating no Gleason grade can be assigned.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
