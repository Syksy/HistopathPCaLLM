Based on the provided text, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
1. **Sampletype**: The text doesn't clearly specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. It mentions "prepared sample set" and "macro sections" but doesn't definitively indicate the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: No definitive malignant findings are reported in this statement. The text only mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior incomplete report, but this is not a confirmed diagnosis.

3. **Gleason**: While "potential Gleason 3 findings" are mentioned, this is from a prior incomplete report and not a confirmed diagnosis. The current statement is about reprocessing the sample, not reporting actual findings.
