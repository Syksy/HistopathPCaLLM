Based on the provided text, this appears to be a description of teaching material consisting of multiple patient samples rather than a single patient's histopathological report. The text mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4, with the most severe being Gleason 3+4.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Note: I selected "biopsy" as the sample type since biopsies were mentioned first among the multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings). The malignancy is "yes" because some cases were upgraded to Gleason scores. The Gleason grade represents the most severe lesion mentioned, which was "at most 3+4", resulting in "3+4=7".
