Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:
1. The sample type
2. Whether malignant tumor was found
3. The Gleason grade from the most severe lesion

From the text:
- The samples are described as "tissue cylinders" with measurements in millimeters, which is characteristic of biopsy samples
- Adenocarcinoma (malignant tumor) is confirmed in the conclusion
- Two samples contain tumor with Gleason patterns:
  - Sample 1: Gleason 4 pattern (20%) and Gleason 3 pattern (30%)
  - Sample 2: Gleason 4 pattern (15%) and Gleason 3 pattern (<35%)

Since Sample 1 has a higher percentage of Gleason 4 pattern (20% vs 15%), it represents the most severe lesion. The Gleason grade is reported as major pattern + minor pattern, so this would be 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
