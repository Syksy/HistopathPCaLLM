Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "material from apex and basis" and refers to samples marked A-F, which suggests tissue samples. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" in clinical notes but states that the material is "very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy" and "the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory." This indicates that malignancy cannot be definitively determined from this examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: While clinical notes mention "possible 'Gleason sum 7'", the pathologist explicitly states it's "unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified." The radiation therapy has made proper assessment impossible.
