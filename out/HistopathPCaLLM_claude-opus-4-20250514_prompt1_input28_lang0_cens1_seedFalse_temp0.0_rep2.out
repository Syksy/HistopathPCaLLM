Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "six different sites of interest" and inspection due to "elevated PSA status," which suggests this is a biopsy procedure. The mention of multiple regions of interest (ROIs) from different locations is typical of prostate biopsy sampling.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes." However, there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. The findings are described as requiring "further inspection" and one sample is being sent for "further evaluation." This indicates suspicious but not confirmed malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the absence of a definitive malignancy diagnosis.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
