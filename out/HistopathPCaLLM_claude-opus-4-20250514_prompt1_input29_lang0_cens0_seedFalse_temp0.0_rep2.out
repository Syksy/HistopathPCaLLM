Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g" and describes systematic sampling from apex to higher planes with left and right lobe sections. This sampling pattern and the 40g weight are consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" - so malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" and concludes with "Score sum 7". While the text appears to have a typo (mentioning grade 4 twice), given that the sum is 7 and grade 4 is the predominant pattern, the Gleason score is 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
