Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify the most severe lesion and extract the required information.

The statement describes multiple biopsies:
1. Initial systematic biopsy: Gleason 3+3=6
2. First targeted biopsy: technical failure, no results
3. Second targeted biopsy: large focus with primary pattern 4 and likely secondary pattern 5

The most severe lesion is from the second targeted biopsy with Gleason pattern 4 (primary) and pattern 5 (secondary), giving a Gleason score of 4+5=9.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
