Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples were taken" but doesn't specify whether these are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP samples. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "suspicious findings" but does not definitively state whether malignant tumor was found. "Suspicious" is not the same as confirmed malignancy. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement. Therefore, this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
