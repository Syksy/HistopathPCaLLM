Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the text
- Malignancy is "yes" because multifocal adenocarcinoma was found in the prostate
- The most severe Gleason pattern mentioned is 4+4, which equals 8
- Although lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, the primary prostate tissue had malignant findings
