Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data for the most severe lesion found:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy) as stated in the text
- Malignancy is "yes" because multifocal adenocarcinoma was found in the prostate
- The most severe Gleason pattern mentioned is 4+4 (sum of 8), which represents the highest grade among the patterns listed (3+3, 3+4, 4+3, and 4+4)
