Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "RP" - The mention of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles" being examined indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as these structures are typically examined together in RP specimens.
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement does not explicitly mention whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue itself. It only states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were "clear" (negative).
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.
