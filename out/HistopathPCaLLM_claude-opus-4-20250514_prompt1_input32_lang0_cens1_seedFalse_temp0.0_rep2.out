Based on the provided text, I can extract the following structured information:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The text mentions "primary prostate tissue" and examination of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles," which suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. However, the text does not provide clear information about whether malignancy was found or any Gleason grading, so these fields are marked as "NA".
