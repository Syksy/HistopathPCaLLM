Based on the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP
- **Malignancy**: "no" - The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and doesn't report any malignant tumor findings
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grade is not applicable
