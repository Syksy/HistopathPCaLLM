Looking at this histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr" which suggests this is a tissue specimen from either TURP or RP. Given the relatively small weight (7.5g) and the fact it was divided into multiple cassettes, this is most consistent with a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely meant to say "prostatic carcinoma" or similar). It describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which indicates benign findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is present, Gleason grade is not applicable.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",

  "Gleason": "NA"
