Looking at this histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr" which suggests a tissue specimen rather than needle biopsies. The weight and processing method are most consistent with a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely incomplete sentence meaning "prostatic carcinoma/malignancy") and describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which indicates benign findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, Gleason grade is not applicable.
