Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions the sample weighs 7.5g and was prepared into six tissue cassettes. This weight and processing method is most consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as biopsies are much smaller and radical prostatectomies are much larger.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (likely meaning prostatic carcinoma). Despite mentioning some concerning features (glands close together, partial cribriform structures), the overall conclusion is benign.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade is applicable.
