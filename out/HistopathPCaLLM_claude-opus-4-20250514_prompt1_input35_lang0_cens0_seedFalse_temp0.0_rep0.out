Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma" - so no malignant tumor was found
3. **Gleason grade**: Since there is no malignancy/carcinoma, there is no Gleason grade to report

The findings mentioned (high-grade PIN and hyperplasia) are not malignant conditions.
