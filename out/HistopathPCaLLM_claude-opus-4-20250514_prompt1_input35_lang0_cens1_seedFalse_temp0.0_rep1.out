Looking at the provided statement:

- The text mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe" but doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- The findings include "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" - both of which are benign conditions, not malignant tumors
- Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report
