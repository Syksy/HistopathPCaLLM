Looking at this histopathological statement:

- The text mentions "samples" without specifying the exact procedure type (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) and hyperplasia are mentioned, but no adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor is reported
- Since there is no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
