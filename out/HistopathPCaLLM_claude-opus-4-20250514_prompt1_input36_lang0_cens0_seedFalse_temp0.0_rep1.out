Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" which indicates a surgical specimen. The presence of "nodular hyperplasia" suggests this is likely a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as these typically show hyperplastic changes and are measured by weight and dimensions.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity or inflammation"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there is no malignancy, Gleason grade is not applicable.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
