Looking at this histopathological statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample size and weight is normal" and preparation of multiple cassettes, which suggests a larger tissue sample rather than needle biopsies. The mention of "nodular hyperplasia" is typical of TURP specimens. While not explicitly stated, this appears to be a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings mention "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" - both are benign conditions. No malignant findings are reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
