Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample size and weight is normal" and describes macro/micro examination with multiple cassettes, which suggests a tissue specimen. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific sample type cannot be determined from the text, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" - both of which are benign conditions. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. Therefore, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found (only benign hyperplasia), there would be no Gleason grade assigned. This should be "NA".

  "Gleason": "NA"
