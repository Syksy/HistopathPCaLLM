Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "7g of electrosection chippings" which is characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, where tissue is removed in small chips using electrocautery.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings only mention "hyperplasia" (benign enlargement) and inflammation. There is no mention of carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or any malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.
