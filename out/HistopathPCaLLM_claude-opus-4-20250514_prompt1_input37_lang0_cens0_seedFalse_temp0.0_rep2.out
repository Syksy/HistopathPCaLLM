Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "7g of electrosection chippings" which indicates this is from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as electrosection chippings are characteristic of TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings indicate "hyperplasia" (benign prostatic hyperplasia), with no mention of carcinoma or malignant findings. Therefore, no malignancy is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (hyperplasia), there is no Gleason grade to report.
