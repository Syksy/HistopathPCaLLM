Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement does not specify whether this is a biopsy, RP, or TURP sample
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The examination is incomplete and no definitive malignancy findings are reported yet
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grading is mentioned as the examination is not complete
