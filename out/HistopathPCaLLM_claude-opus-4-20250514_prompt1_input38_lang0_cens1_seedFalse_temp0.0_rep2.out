Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" and "hyperplastic prostate tissue" which suggests this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as hyperplastic tissue is commonly found in TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The findings only mention "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" - these are benign findings with no mention of carcinoma or malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable.
