Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" which suggests a tissue sample, but doesn't explicitly state if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings", indicating uncertainty about malignancy. Therefore: "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement clearly states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point". Therefore: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
