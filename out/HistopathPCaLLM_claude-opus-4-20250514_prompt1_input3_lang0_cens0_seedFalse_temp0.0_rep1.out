Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" which indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen, as chippings are characteristic of this procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found", so there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found (this is a benign specimen), there is no Gleason grade to report.

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
