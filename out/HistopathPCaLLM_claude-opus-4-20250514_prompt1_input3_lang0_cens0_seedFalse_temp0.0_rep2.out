Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" which is characteristic of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found"
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grade is not applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
