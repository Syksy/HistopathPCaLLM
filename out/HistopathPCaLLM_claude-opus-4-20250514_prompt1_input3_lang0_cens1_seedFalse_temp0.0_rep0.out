Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which suggests a larger tissue sample typical of TURP or RP procedures rather than a biopsy. However, without explicit mention of the procedure type, I cannot definitively determine if it's RP or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived," meaning malignancy could not be determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was reported and the examination was inconclusive, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
