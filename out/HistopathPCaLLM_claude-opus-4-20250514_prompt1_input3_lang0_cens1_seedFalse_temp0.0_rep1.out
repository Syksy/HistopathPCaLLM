Looking at the provided statement, I can extract the following information:

1. The sample contains "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which suggests this is likely a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) or RP (radical prostatectomy) specimen rather than a biopsy, as biopsies are typically much smaller. However, the exact type is not explicitly stated.

2. The statement indicates that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived," meaning no definitive diagnosis of malignancy can be made.

3. Since no malignancy is reported and the examination was inconclusive, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
