Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which suggests a larger tissue sample typical of TURP or RP procedures rather than a biopsy. However, without explicit mention of the procedure type, I cannot definitively determine which it is.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run," meaning they could not determine if malignant tissue was present or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no conclusive findings could be made due to the burn artifacts, no Gleason grade can be reported.
