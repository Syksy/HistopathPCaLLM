Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" based on the weight measurement (8.9g) and multiple cassettes, which is typical for TURP specimens
- Malignancy is "NA" because the findings are inconclusive ("possibly something else") and further examination is needed
- Gleason is "NA" as no definitive malignancy is reported
