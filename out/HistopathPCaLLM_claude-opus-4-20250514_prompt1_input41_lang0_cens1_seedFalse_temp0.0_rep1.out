Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The statement mentions samples collected from left and right lobes, which is typical of a biopsy procedure
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The pathologist explicitly states it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not", indicating uncertainty about malignancy
- **Gleason**: "NA" - Since no definitive malignancy was identified, no Gleason grade is applicable
