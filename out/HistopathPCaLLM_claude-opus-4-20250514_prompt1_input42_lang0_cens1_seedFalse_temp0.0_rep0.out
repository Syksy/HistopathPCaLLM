Looking at the provided statement:

"Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared. Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined."

Based on the analysis:
- The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain - they cannot determine if it's cancer or inflammation
- Since malignancy cannot be confirmed, there would be no Gleason grade
