Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" and approximately 30g of material, which is characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material," indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, there is no Gleason grade to report.

  "Gleason": "NA"
