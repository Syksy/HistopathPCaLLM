Looking at the provided statement:

"Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Based on the analysis:
- The 30g sample size suggests this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as biopsies are much smaller and radical prostatectomy specimens are typically larger
- No malignant tumor findings are reported - the pathologist explicitly states "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached"
- Since there are no malignant findings, there is no Gleason grade to report
