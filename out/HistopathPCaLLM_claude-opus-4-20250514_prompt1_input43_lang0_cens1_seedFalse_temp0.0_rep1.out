Looking at the provided statement:

"Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Based on the analysis:
- The 30g sample size suggests this is likely a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen, as biopsies are much smaller and radical prostatectomies are typically larger
- The statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" - meaning malignancy cannot be determined
- Since malignancy cannot be determined, there would be no Gleason grade
