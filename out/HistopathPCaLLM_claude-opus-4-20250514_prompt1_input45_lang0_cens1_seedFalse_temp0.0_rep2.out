Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "suspect prostate sample" and describes multiple sections (E, F, G, O, P), mentions "seminal vesicles," "marginals," "capsule," and "lymph nodes." This comprehensive examination pattern is characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "gland structures and canals are separated" and mentions "negative marginals" and "no metastases seen in lymph nodes." However, there is no definitive statement about the presence of adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor. The phrase "structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "Further inspection is needed" suggests the findings are inconclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement.
