Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- Sample type is "TURP" because "shaved prostate chippings" is characteristic of transurethral resection of prostate tissue
- Malignancy is "no" because the statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
- Gleason is "NA" because this is a benign finding with no malignancy detected
