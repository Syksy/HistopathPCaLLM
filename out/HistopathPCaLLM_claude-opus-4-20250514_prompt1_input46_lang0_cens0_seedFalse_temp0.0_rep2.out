Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" - indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no cancer detected, there is no Gleason grade to report.

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
