Looking at this histopathological statement:

- The text mentions "Prostate material" without specifying if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
- The pathologist states they are "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not" - this means malignancy cannot be determined
- Since malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grade can be assigned
