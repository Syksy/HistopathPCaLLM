Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this indicates autopsy samples, which don't fit into the allowed values of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns" but explicitly states these are "for educational purposes" and that "this is not used to derive differentiation scores". There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor. The findings appear to be non-diagnostic educational observations. Therefore, this should be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states they are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)". No Gleason grade is reported. Therefore, this should be "NA".

  "Gleason": "NA"
