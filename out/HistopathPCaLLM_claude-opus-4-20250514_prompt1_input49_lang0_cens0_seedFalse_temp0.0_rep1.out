Looking at this statement, I can extract the following information:

1. The sample mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which is characteristic of a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. The statement clearly indicates "5 shavings contained carcinoma," confirming malignant tumor findings.

3. The Gleason grading is reported as "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4," which translates to Gleason 3+4=7.
