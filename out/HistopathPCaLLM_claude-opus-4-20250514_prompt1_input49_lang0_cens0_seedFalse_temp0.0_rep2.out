Looking at this statement, I can extract the following information:

1. The sample mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. Carcinoma was found in 5 shavings, indicating malignant tumor findings
3. The Gleason grades are reported as "most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4", which translates to Gleason 3+4=7
