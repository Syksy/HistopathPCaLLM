Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The rationale for this structuring:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify if they are from biopsy, RP, or TURP
- **Malignancy**: "NA" - The statement indicates "changes that warrant further investigation" but explicitly states that "assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations," so malignancy cannot be determined
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported in the statement
