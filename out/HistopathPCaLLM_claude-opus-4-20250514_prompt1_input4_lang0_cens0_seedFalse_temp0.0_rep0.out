Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "benign prostate tissue is observed" and "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" - so no malignancy was found
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade to report

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
