Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" and describes the tissue as "benign prostate tissue" - so there are no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no adenocarcinoma, there is no Gleason grade to report.
