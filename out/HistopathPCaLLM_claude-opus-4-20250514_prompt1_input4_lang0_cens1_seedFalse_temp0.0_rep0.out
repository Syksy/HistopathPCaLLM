Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sampling sites" and "sample" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma." This means no malignancy was detected, though the assessment was limited by sample quality. The answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not applicable. The answer is "NA".
