Looking at the provided statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample material" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific procedure type is not mentioned, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and mentions that the sample is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma." This means they couldn't definitively determine if malignancy was present or absent due to insufficient material. Therefore, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was detected and the assessment was inconclusive, there is no Gleason grade to report. This should be "NA".

  "Gleason": "NA"
