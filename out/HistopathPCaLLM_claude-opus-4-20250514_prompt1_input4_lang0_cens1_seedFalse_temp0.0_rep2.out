Looking at the provided statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample material" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific procedure type is not mentioned, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and mentions that the sample is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma." This means no malignancy was detected, so the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
