Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "relatively enlarged prostate" and describes systematic sampling from different regions (left/right, apex/basis) with color coding, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen processing.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" and mentions "Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros." This indicates that while there are architectural changes suggestive of malignancy, the Gleason grading could not be determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: As explicitly stated, the Gleason grades could not be inferred, so this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
