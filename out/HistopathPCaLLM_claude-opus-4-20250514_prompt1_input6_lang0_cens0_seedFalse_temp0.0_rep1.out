Looking at the provided statement, I'll extract the structured data:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving chips" which indicates this is from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as this is the standard method that produces tissue shavings/chips.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "benign prostate hyperplasia" and describes "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" with no mention of malignancy, so this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, Gleason grading is not applicable.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
