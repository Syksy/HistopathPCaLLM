Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material rather than a biopsy. Since it's fragmented operation material but not specifically mentioned as radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP, and given the inconclusive nature, the most appropriate value is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and the results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). No malignancy is reported, but since the examination is incomplete and inconclusive, the appropriate value is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and given the inconclusive nature of the examination, this is "NA".
