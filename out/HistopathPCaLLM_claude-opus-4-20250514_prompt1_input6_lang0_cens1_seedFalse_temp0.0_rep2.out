Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical removal rather than biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated as radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP, and the material is described as "very fragmented," this most closely aligns with TURP material.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and mentions that results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). No malignancy is reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grade is not applicable.
