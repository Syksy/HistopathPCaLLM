```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning for this structure:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" - The text clearly mentions "prostate biopsies"
- **Malignancy**: "no" - While there are suspicious findings suggesting adenocarcinoma, the pathologist explicitly states that "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet" and the findings "remain on the suspicion-level", indicating no definitive malignant diagnosis
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported since there is no confirmed malignancy
