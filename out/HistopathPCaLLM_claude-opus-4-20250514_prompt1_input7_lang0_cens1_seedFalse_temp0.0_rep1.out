Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" - The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP
- **Malignancy**: "no" - While atypical structures were noted, the statement indicates "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the finding was "diminishingly small," suggesting no confirmed malignancy
- **Gleason**: "NA" - No Gleason grade is reported as no malignancy was confirmed
