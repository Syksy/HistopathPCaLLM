Looking at this pathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" in sample 3, which is where the tumor tissue is found. This corresponds to "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "tumor tissue is observed" with "invasive properties" and mentions Gleason grading, confirming malignant findings. This is "yes".

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7". This should be reported as "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
