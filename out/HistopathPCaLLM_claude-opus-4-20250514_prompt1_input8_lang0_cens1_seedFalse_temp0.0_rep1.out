Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" with indices and refers to "prostate tissue" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Without clear indication, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Gleason patterns" and discusses grades, which are only used for malignant findings. Although the actual grade values are missing (shown as "?"), the presence of Gleason grading indicates malignancy was found. The statement also mentions samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings," implying sample 3 (the main sample) had malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" - the actual grade values are missing from the report, so this should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
