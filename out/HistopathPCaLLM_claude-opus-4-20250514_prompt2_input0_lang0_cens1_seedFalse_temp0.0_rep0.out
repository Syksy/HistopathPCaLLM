Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn." This indicates that no malignancy was found, so the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, the Gleason grade is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
