Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies" - so this is a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma" and concludes with "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." This indicates no definitive malignant tumor was found - the findings are suspicious but uncertain, leaning towards benign.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive carcinoma was diagnosed, there would be no Gleason grade reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
