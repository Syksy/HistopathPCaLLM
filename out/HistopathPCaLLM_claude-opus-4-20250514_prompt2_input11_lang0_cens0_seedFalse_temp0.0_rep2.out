Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", confirming the presence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason grading 4+3", which gives us a Gleason score of 4+3=7.

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
