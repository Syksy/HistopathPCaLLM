Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to examining "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions "Gleason scores" (specifically score 4 and score 3), which indicates the presence of malignant findings. Gleason scoring is only applied to adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: While the statement mentions "score 4 and score 3," it explicitly states these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material (only 5% could be investigated). Therefore, no definitive Gleason score is reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
