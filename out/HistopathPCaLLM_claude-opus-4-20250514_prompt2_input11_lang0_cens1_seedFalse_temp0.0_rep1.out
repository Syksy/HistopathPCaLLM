Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to "basis, apex and mid section" being inspected, which suggests a comprehensive examination typical of radical prostatectomy (RP) rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason scores" and specifically references "score 4 and score 3", which are only used in the context of malignant findings. Despite the limited material (only 5% could be investigated), the presence of Gleason scoring indicates malignancy was found.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "score 4 and score 3" but notes these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material. Since a reliable Gleason score cannot be provided, this should be "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
