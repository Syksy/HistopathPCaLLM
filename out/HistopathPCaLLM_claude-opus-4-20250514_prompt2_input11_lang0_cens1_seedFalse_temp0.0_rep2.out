Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to examining "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and references "Gleason scores" (specifically mentioning "score 4 and score 3"), which are only used for malignant prostate cancer. This indicates malignancy is present, so "yes".

3. **Gleason grade**: While the text mentions "score 4 and score 3", it explicitly states these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material (only 5% could be investigated). Since no definitive Gleason score is reported, this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
