Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "eight batches" and describes tissue examination, but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement only mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue" and indicates that examination is still pending (images are in queue). No definitive malignant findings are reported. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement. Therefore, this is "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
