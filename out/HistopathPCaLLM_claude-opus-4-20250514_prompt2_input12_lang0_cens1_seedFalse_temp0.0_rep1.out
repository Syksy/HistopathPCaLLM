Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "eight batches" and describes tissue examination, but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Without clear indication of the sample type, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates this is "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but notes that "high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue." This means the final pathological assessment hasn't been completed yet. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there's no completed pathological assessment and no mention of Gleason grading, this should be "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
