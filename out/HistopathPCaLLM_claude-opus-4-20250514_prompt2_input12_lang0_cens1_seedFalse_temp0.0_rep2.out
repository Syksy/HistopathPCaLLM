Looking at this statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "eight batches" and describes tissue examination, but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement only mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue" and that examination has been started, but no actual findings of malignancy are reported. The high resolution images are still pending. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement. Therefore, this is "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
