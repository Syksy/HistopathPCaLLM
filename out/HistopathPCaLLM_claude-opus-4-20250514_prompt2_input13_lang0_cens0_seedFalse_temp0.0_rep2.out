Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate needle biopsies" which corresponds to "biopsy"

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "carcinoma is observed" which clearly indicates malignant tumor findings, so "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text reports "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)" which gives us the Gleason grade in the required format

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
