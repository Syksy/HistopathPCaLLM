Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples from different locations (right side, left side, sample B) suggests this could be a biopsy series, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B that require "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the findings are suspicious but not definitively diagnosed as malignant.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement.

Since this appears to be a preliminary or inconclusive report awaiting further consultation, and doesn't provide definitive answers to the required fields, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
