Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples from different locations (right/left) suggests this could be a biopsy series, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that require "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the pathologist has not definitively diagnosed malignancy but has identified concerning features that need additional review.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the fact that no definitive malignancy diagnosis has been made.

Since this appears to be an incomplete or preliminary report awaiting consultation, and lacks definitive findings, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
