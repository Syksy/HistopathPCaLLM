Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of multiple samples from different locations (right side, left side, sample B) suggests this could be a biopsy series, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "irregularities" and a "suspicious pattern" that requires "further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification via consultation." This indicates uncertainty - the pathologist has not definitively diagnosed malignancy but has identified concerning features that need additional review.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the fact that no definitive malignancy has been diagnosed.

Since the sample type cannot be determined with certainty and there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy (only suspicious findings requiring further consultation), the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
