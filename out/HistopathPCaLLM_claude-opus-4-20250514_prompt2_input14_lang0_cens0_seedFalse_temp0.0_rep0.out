Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatetectomy preparate" which refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly describes "tumorous growth" and "tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", confirming malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Since Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7, and the larger portion (60%) is score 3, this indicates Gleason 3+4=7

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
