Looking at this statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "specimen," "prostate tissue," and "casettes" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of "prostate capsule border region" and "surgical margin status" suggests this might be from a radical prostatectomy, but it's not definitively stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," but it doesn't explicitly confirm malignant findings in THIS specimen. The statement indicates "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted" before making definitive statements.

3. **Gleason grade**: While a colleague's patient with "Gleason 7 score" is mentioned, no Gleason grade is reported for THIS patient's specimen.

Since the statement doesn't provide definitive answers and indicates that further investigation is needed before making conclusive statements, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
