Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings" which indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material", so malignancy is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8". Since Gleason 4 is mentioned as the major component and the sum is 8, this indicates a Gleason score of 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
