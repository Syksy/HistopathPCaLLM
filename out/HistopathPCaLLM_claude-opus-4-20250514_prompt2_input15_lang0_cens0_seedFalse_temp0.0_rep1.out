Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" which is characteristic of a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure where tissue is removed in small pieces or "chips".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material", so malignant tumor is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". While this doesn't explicitly state the minor grade, a Gleason sum of 8 with grade 4 being most represented indicates a 4+4=8 pattern.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
