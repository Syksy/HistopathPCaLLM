Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that no definitive malignant findings were made. It mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but explicitly states this "was not based on any histopathology" and that findings need to be revised in the next examination. Since no actual malignant tumor was confirmed in this examination, the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: The text clearly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." While clinical notes mentioned suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this was not confirmed by histopathology. Therefore, this is "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
