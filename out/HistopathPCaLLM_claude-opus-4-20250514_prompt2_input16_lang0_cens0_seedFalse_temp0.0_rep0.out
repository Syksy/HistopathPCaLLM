Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate" - clearly indicating this is a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses" with specific measurements (7mm, 6mm, and 2mm), confirming malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text describes "mainly level 3 grade growth" with "some Gleason 4-type of looping structures" and concludes with "score 7" where "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part". This indicates Gleason 3 is the major component and Gleason 4 is the minor component.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
