Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate" - this is clearly a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses" - this indicates malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mainly level 3 grade growth" and "some Gleason 4-type of looping structures" with "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." The conclusion states "score 7". Based on the predominance of grade 3 (2/3) over grade 4 (1/3), this represents Gleason 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
