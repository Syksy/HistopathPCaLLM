Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "suspicious foci" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" and potential "mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation," which suggests possible malignancy. However, it explicitly states that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive" and that proper grading needs to be done manually. No definitive diagnosis of malignancy is provided.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions potential "3+4 or 4+3" grades as examples, but clearly states that grading is "inconclusive" due to technical issues with digitalization.

Since this statement does not provide a definitive diagnosis or grading due to technical issues with the digital images, and requires manual re-evaluation, it should be treated as inconclusive.
