Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "Prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Multiple clear foci emerge" with "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", indicating malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". Following the standard Gleason scoring convention where the most dominant pattern is listed first, this would be scored as 4+3=7.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
