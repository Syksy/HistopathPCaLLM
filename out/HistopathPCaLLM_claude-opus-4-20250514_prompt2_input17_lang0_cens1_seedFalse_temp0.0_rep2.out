Looking at this statement, I can see it describes the processing and preparation of prostate tissue samples, but it does not contain any actual diagnostic findings or results. The text mentions that assessment will be done by resident candidates in a future course session, and results will be appended later.

Since this is a preliminary report describing sample preparation and future assessment plans rather than actual histopathological findings, I should structure it as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
