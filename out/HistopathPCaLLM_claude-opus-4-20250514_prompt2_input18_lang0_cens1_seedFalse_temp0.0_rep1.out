Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "standard prostate related procedures" and "12 tissue batches" which suggests a biopsy procedure (multiple tissue samples/cores are typical for prostate biopsies).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates ">95% of material appears benign" and mentions a "small fraction" that "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above, but the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group." This indicates no definitive malignant findings - only suspicious areas that cannot be confirmed as malignant.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive malignancy is reported and the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group," no Gleason grade can be determined.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
