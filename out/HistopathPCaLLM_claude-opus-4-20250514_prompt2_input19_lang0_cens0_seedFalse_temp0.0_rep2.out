Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion found.

The statement describes 4 prostate biopsy samples, where:
- Sample 1: unrepresentative
- Samples 2 & 3: healthy benign tissue
- Sample 4: contains adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%)

Since Sample 4 contains the most severe findings (adenocarcinoma), I'll structure the data based on this sample:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
