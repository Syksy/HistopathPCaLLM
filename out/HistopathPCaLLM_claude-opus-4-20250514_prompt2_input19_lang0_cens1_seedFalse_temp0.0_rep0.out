Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific type is not mentioned, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes samples 1-3 as either unrepresentative or benign. Sample 4 is described as having "cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue" and is noted as "possibly malignant," but there's uncertainty about whether it's even prostate tissue. The statement indicates that verification is needed before proceeding. Since no definitive malignant tumor finding is reported, this should be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the absence of confirmed malignancy. This should be "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
