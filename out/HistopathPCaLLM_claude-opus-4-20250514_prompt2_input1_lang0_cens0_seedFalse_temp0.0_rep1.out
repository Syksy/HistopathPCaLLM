Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly mentions "12 representative needle biopsies" - this indicates a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Normal glandular structures" and "hyperplastic characteristics" with the conclusion that "only benign-like growth is observed" - this indicates no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade to report.
