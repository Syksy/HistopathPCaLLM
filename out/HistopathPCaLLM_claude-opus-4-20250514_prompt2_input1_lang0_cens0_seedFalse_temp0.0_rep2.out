Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The sample type is clearly stated as "needle biopsies" (12 representative needle biopsies)
2. The findings describe "normal glandular structures" and "benign-like growth" with no mention of malignancy
3. Since only benign findings are reported, there is no Gleason grade

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
