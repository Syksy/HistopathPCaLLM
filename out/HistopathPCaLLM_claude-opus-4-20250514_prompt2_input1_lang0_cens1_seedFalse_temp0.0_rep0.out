Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. The statement mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" which suggests this is a biopsy procedure (samples from multiple standard locations is typical for prostate biopsies)

2. The statement indicates the results are "inconclusive" and "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy" - this means no definitive malignant tumor findings were reported

3. Since no malignancy was confirmed, there would be no Gleason grade reported

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
