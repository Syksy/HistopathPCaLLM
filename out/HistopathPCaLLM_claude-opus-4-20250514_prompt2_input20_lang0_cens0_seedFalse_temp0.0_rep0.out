Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The sample type is clearly stated as "prostatectomy resection" which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy)

2. Malignant tumor findings are present - the statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both the apex and basis

3. For Gleason grading, two different grades are mentioned:
   - Apex: Gleason 3+4
   - Basis: Gleason 4+4
   
Since the instructions specify to report only the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+4=8 is more severe than Gleason 3+4=7, I should report the 4+4=8 grade.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
