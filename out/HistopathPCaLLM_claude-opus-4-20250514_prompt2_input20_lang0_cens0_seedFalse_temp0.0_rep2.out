Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostatectomy resection" which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy)

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both apex and basis samples, indicating malignant tumor findings

3. **Gleason grade**: Two different Gleason grades are reported:
   - Apex: Gleason 3+4
   - Basis: Gleason 4+4
   
   Since the instructions specify to report only the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+4=8 is more severe than Gleason 3+4=7, I should report the 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
