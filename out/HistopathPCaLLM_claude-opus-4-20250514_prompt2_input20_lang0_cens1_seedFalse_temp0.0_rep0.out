Looking at this statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into "six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." This anatomical description (apex, middle, basis) is consistent with radical prostatectomy (RP) sampling methodology.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." This means they cannot determine if malignancy is present or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a hypothetical Gleason score ("such as 3+4") but clearly states this is only hypothetical and that actual examination is impossible. Therefore, no actual Gleason grade is reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
