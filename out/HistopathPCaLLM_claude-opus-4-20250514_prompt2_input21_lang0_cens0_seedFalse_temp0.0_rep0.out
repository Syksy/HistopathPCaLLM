Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings" which are terms typically used for TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens. The weight measurement (19g total) also supports this being a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes malignant findings - "poorly differentiated growth", "tumor-like tissue" covering roughly half the area, enlarged nuclei with visible nucleoli - all indicating cancer is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement indicates "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which translates to a Gleason score of 5+4=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
