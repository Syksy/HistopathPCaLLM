Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The description of "poorly differentiated growth", "tumor-like tissue", and Gleason grading clearly indicates malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement indicates "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which represents a Gleason score of 5+4=9

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
