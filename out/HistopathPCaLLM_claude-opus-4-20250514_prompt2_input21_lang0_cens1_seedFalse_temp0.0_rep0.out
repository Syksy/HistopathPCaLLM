Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "extracted prostate material" and "fragments" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes technical issues with the sample quality ("nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise", "too noisy material") and indicates that quality control (QC) needs to be conducted before a proper assessment can be made. No definitive malignant findings are reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, which is consistent with the fact that the material quality is too poor for proper assessment.

This appears to be a case where the sample quality is inadequate for diagnosis, and the pathologist is requesting additional quality control before making any determinations.
