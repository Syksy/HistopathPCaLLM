Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies" - this is a biopsy
2. **Malignancy**: The left side shows "carcinoma tissue structures" with Gleason scores, indicating malignancy is present
3. **Gleason grade**: The left side (which has the malignant findings) shows "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which means the primary pattern is 3 and secondary pattern is 4

Since only the most severe lesion should be reported, and the left side has carcinoma while the right side is benign, I report the left side findings.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
