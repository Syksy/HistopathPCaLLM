Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragments, but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since the specific type isn't mentioned, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to the poor quality of the samples. This means they couldn't determine if malignancy was present or not, so this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and the samples need reprocessing. No Gleason grade was assigned, so this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
