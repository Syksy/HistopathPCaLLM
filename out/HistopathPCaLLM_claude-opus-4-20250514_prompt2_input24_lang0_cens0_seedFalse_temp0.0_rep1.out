Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "turp-chippings" which indicates this is a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", clearly indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". While the complete grade pattern (major+minor) is not explicitly stated, a Gleason sum of 8 with mention of Gleason 4 pattern suggests this is likely 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
