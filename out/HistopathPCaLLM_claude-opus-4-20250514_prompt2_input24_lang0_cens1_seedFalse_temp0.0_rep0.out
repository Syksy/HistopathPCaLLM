Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it carefully:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings" - multiple types are mentioned, so I cannot determine a single sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The text indicates that "around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". This means some cases were found to have malignancy, but this appears to be teaching material reviewing multiple patients, not a single patient's pathology report.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason grades are mentioned (3+3 and 3+4), this is describing multiple cases in teaching material, not reporting on a single patient's most severe lesion.

This statement describes a teaching exercise reviewing multiple patients' samples rather than a single patient's histopathological report. Therefore, it doesn't fit the criteria for a valid histopathological statement about a single patient.
