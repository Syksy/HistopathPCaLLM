Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "tissue cylinders" and measurements in millimeters, which is characteristic of biopsy samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma", confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: 
   - Sample (1): Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and pattern 3 (30%)
   - Sample (2): Gleason pattern 4 (15%) and pattern 3 (<35%)
   - Sample (3): No abnormal tissue

Since I need to report the most severe lesion, Sample (1) appears more severe with higher percentages of Gleason patterns. Following standard Gleason scoring where the most prevalent pattern is listed first, and given that pattern 3 has higher percentage than pattern 4 in Sample (1), the grade would be 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
