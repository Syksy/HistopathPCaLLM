Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "tissue sample" and "fragmented tissue material" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion explicitly states "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified." This means they cannot determine if there is malignancy or not. Therefore: "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy cannot be verified and the statement mentions that "differentiation could not be assessed" in sample 2, no Gleason grade can be determined. Therefore: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
