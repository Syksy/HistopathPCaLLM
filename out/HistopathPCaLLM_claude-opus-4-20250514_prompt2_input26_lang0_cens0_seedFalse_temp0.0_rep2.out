Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate" - this is a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "a widely spread tumor, which spans all the way from apex to basis" - this confirms malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent" - this indicates Gleason 3+4=7

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
