Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "material originates from the prostate" and describes processing with apex and basis samples, but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Given the lack of clear specification, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" from clinical notes, but the histological inspection reveals the material is "very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy" and "the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory." This indicates that malignancy cannot be definitively determined from this examination, so this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: While clinical notes mention "possible 'Gleason sum 7'", the pathologist states "it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified." The radiation therapy has made the tissue unassessable, so no definitive Gleason grade can be reported. This should be "NA".
