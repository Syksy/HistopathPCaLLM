Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "six different sites of interest" and inspection due to "elevated PSA status" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Without clear indication of the sampling method, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and "hyperplastic changes." These terms suggest abnormal but not definitively malignant findings. The statement indicates findings that "warrant further inspection" and material being sent for "further evaluation," suggesting the diagnosis is not conclusive for malignancy. Therefore, this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement, which is consistent with the absence of confirmed malignancy. This is "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
