Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes systematic sampling from apex through different planes, which is characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" - so malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" and concludes with "Score sum 7". While the wording is somewhat unclear (mentioning grade 4 twice), given that the sum is 7 and grade 4 is mentioned as the predominant pattern, the most logical interpretation is Gleason 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
