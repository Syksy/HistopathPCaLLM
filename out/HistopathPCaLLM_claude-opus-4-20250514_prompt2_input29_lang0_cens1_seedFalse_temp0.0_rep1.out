Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material" and describes a sampling procedure with multiple samples (A-F) from different locations. This appears to be describing a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "tumor cells" and discusses "differentiation stages of tumor cells" and "poor differentiation," which indicates malignant findings were present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The summary explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible," indicating that while malignancy was found, the Gleason score could not be determined.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
