Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Since this is from an autopsy rather than a therapeutic procedure, and none of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP) apply to autopsy specimens, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly indicates benign findings - "normal benign growth", "no abnormal growth", "no tumor growth", and the summary states the tissue contains "at most a low inflammatory state" with changes "attributed to normal aging." This is clearly "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, Gleason grading is not applicable, so this should be "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
