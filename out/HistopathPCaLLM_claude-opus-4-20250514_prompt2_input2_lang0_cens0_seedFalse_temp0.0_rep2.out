Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Since this is from an autopsy (not a clinical procedure), the appropriate value is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly indicates benign findings - "normal benign growth", "no abnormal growth", "no tumor growth", and the summary states "at most a low inflammatory state" with changes "attributed to normal aging". This indicates "no" malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
