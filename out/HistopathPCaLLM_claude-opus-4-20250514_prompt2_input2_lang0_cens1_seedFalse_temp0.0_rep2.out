Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "autopsy specimen" which doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but explicitly states that "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and that "Further inspection and sample re-runs are required." This indicates that no definitive malignant findings were reported. Therefore, this should be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was definitively found, no Gleason grade would be reported. Therefore, this should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
