Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion mentioned.

The text describes:
- Sample type: "chippings" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
- Malignancy: The text confirms adenocarcinoma with specific Gleason grading
- Gleason grade: The most severe lesion shows grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3

Based on these findings, here is the structured JSON:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
