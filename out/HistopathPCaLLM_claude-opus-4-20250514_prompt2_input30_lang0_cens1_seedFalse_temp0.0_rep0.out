Looking at this statement, I can see it's describing a consultation appendix regarding uncertain findings, not an actual histopathological report of prostate tissue examination.

The key indicators are:
- It's labeled as "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION"
- It discusses "uncertainties regarding the findings" and consultations between doctors
- No specific prostate tissue sample type is mentioned
- No definitive malignancy determination is made ("could not confirm or deny")
- No Gleason grading is reported
- It concludes that "further examination" is needed

Since this is not a valid histopathological statement containing actual tissue examination results, all fields should be "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
