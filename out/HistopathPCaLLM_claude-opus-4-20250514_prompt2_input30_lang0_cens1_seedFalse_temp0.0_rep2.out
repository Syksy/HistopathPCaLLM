Looking at this statement, I can see it's describing a consultation appendix regarding uncertain findings, not an actual histopathological report of prostate tissue examination.

The key indicators are:
- It's labeled as "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION"
- It discusses "uncertainties regarding the findings" and "atypical findings were suspected"
- It states the diagnosis "could not be confirmed or denied"
- It concludes that "defining their status requires further examination"

Since this is not a valid histopathological statement containing definitive findings about prostate tissue, sample type, or Gleason grading, all fields should be "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
