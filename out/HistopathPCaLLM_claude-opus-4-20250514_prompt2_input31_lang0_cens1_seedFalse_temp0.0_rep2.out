Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples were taken" but doesn't specify whether these are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP samples. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "suspicious findings" but never confirms the presence of malignant tumor. "Suspicious" is not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement. Therefore, this is "NA".

This appears to be a preliminary or inconclusive report that describes suspicious findings requiring further investigation, but does not provide a definitive diagnosis or the specific information requested.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
