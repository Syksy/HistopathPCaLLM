Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy" which corresponds to "RP"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" with various Gleason patterns, so malignancy is "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple Gleason patterns are mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3). Following the instruction to report only the most severe lesion, Gleason 4+4 is the highest grade mentioned.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
