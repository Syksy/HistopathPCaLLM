Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined suggests this might be from a radical prostatectomy, but this is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear" which indicates no malignancy in those structures. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue itself.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since the statement lacks clear information about the sample type, doesn't explicitly confirm or deny malignancy in the prostate tissue, and provides no Gleason grade information, all fields should be marked as "NA".

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
