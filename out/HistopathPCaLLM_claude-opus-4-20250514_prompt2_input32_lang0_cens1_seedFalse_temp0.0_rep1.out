Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The mention of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined suggests this might be from a radical prostatectomy, but it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear" which indicates no malignancy in those structures. However, it doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue itself.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since this statement lacks clear information about the sample type, doesn't explicitly confirm or deny malignancy in the prostate tissue, and provides no Gleason grade information, it should be classified as an incomplete/invalid histopathological statement.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
