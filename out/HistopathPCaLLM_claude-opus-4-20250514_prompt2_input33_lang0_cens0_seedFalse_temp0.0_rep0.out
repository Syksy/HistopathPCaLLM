Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "Radical prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is an RP (radical prostatectomy) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes tumor growth patterns, tumor penetration of the capsule, and findings in lymph nodes, clearly indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". Since we need to report only the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+3=7 is more severe than 3+4=7 (due to the higher primary pattern), the most severe grade is 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
