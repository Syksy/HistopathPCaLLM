Looking at the provided statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "collected samples" and "lymph nodes" and "seminal vehicles" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" - but "possibly abnormal" is not a definitive malignant finding.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since there are no definitive malignant tumor findings reported and no Gleason grade mentioned, this appears to be a statement without confirmed malignancy.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
