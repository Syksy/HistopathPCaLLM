Looking at the provided statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "collected samples" and "lymph nodes" and "seminal vehicles" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but doesn't definitively state whether malignancy was found or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement.

Since this statement lacks clear information about the sample type, doesn't definitively confirm or deny malignancy, and provides no Gleason grade information, it should be classified as an invalid/incomplete histopathological statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
