Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "resection weighing 7.5gr" - this appears to be a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) based on the weight and description.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities" - this is definitively negative for malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade to report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
