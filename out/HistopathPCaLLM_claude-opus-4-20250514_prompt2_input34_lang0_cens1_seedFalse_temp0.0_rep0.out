Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "prepared into six tissue casettes" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The weight and processing suggest it could be TURP tissue, but without explicit mention, I cannot determine the sample type definitively.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" which indicates benign findings. The phrase "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (though incomplete) suggests no malignancy. The glandular changes described (close glands, partial cribriform structures) appear to be part of the hyperplastic changes rather than carcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this appears to be a benign finding (hyperplasia with inflammation), there would be no Gleason grade.
