Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "weighing 7.5gr" and "prepared into six tissue casettes" but doesn't explicitly state if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The weight and processing into multiple cassettes could suggest TURP or small RP specimen, but without explicit mention, I cannot determine the sample type definitively.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "glands are very close to each other, partial cribriform structures noted" and concludes with "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." The final diagnosis is benign hyperplasia with inflammation, not malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (hyperplasia), there is no Gleason grade to report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
