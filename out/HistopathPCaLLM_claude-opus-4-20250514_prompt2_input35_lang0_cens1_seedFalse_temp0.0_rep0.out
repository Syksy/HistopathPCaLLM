Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe" without specifying the procedure type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and "hyperplasia". PIN is a precancerous condition but is not malignant carcinoma. Hyperplasia is benign. No adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor is mentioned, so this is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there is no malignancy reported, Gleason grading is not applicable, so this is "NA".
