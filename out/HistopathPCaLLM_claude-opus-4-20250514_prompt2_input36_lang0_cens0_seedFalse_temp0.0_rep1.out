Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. The specimen weighs 80g and measures 7x6x5 cm, which is consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen based on the size and weight
2. The findings describe nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia with explicitly stated "No signs of malignity"
3. Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
