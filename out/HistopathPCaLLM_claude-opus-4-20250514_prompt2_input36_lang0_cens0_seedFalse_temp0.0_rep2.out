Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. The specimen weighs 80g and measures 7x6x5 cm, which is consistent with a prostate specimen from either radical prostatectomy (RP) or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
2. The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity"
3. Since there is no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report

Based on the specimen size and the mention of nodular hyperplasia (which is commonly found in TURP specimens for benign prostatic hyperplasia), this appears to be a TURP specimen.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
