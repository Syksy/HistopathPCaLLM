Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:
1. Sample type
2. Malignancy findings
3. Gleason grade

Analysis:
- The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" which are benign conditions, not malignant findings
- No specific sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP) is mentioned
- No Gleason grade is reported (which is expected since this appears to be a benign finding)
- The phrase "was not assessed reliably" suggests incomplete evaluation

Based on this analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
