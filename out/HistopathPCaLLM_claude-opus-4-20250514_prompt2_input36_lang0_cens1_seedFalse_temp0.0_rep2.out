Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:
1. Sample type
2. Malignancy findings
3. Gleason grade

The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" - both of which are benign conditions, not malignant findings. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma, cancer, or malignancy. The sample type is not explicitly stated (no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP).

Since hyperplasia is a benign finding, there is no malignancy and therefore no Gleason grade would be assigned.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
