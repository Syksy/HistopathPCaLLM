Looking at the provided statement:

"7g of electrosection chippings as preparate. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in typical places. Findings indicate hyperplasia."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: "electrosection chippings" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. Malignancy: The findings describe "hyperplasia" (benign enlargement), inflammation, and nodular gland components - all benign findings with no mention of carcinoma or malignancy
3. Gleason grade: Not applicable as this is a benign specimen
