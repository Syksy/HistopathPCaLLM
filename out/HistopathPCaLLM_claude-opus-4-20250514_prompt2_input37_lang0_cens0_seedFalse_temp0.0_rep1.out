Looking at the provided statement:

"7g of electrosection chippings as preparate. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in typical places. Findings indicate hyperplasia."

This appears to be a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen based on "electrosection chippings." The findings describe hyperplasia (benign prostatic hyperplasia) with inflammation, and there is no mention of malignancy or carcinoma.
