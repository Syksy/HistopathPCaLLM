Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Less than half of the total sample material preparated. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents. Minor inflammation in places. Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week."

This appears to be an incomplete examination report where:
- The sample type is not specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- No malignancy is reported (only normal prostate tissue with inflammation is described)
- No Gleason grade is mentioned
- The examination is incomplete and will continue

Since the examination is incomplete and no definitive findings regarding malignancy are reported, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
