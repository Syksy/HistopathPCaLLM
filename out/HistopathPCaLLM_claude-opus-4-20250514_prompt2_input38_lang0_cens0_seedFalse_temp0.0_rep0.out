Looking at the provided statement:

"Representative needle biopsies as samples. Total length approx 111 mm. In histological examination, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found. No suspected malignity."

This is a valid histopathological statement that I can structure as follows:

1. Sample type: "needle biopsies" indicates this is a biopsy
2. Malignancy: "No suspected malignity" clearly indicates no malignant findings
3. Gleason: Since this is a benign finding, Gleason grade is not applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
