Looking at the provided statement: "Representative samples are collected. Total measurements provided in millimeters. In histological examination, some finding including hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found."

Let me analyze this according to the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

2. **Malignancy**: The findings mention "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" - hyperplasia and inflammation are benign conditions, not malignant. No adenocarcinoma or other malignancy is mentioned.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is present, there would be no Gleason grade to report.
