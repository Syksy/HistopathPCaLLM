Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "A prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor with 3 foci" and describes Gleason grading, confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7." Since Gleason 3 is identified as the major pattern, the grade would be 3+4=7.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
