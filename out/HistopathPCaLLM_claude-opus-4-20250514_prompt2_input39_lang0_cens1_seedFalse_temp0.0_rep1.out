Looking at this statement, I need to extract:
1. Sample type
2. Malignancy status
3. Gleason grade

From the text:
- The statement mentions "Sample under examination has size of 20" and "slices extracted" which suggests a tissue sample, but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, RP, or TURP
- It explicitly states "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings" - indicating uncertainty about malignancy
- It states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point"

Since the sample type cannot be determined from the given information, and there is explicit uncertainty about malignancy status, I should use "NA" for these fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
