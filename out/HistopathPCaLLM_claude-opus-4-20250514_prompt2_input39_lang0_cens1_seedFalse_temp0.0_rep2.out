Looking at this statement, I need to extract:
1. Sample type
2. Malignancy status
3. Gleason grade

From the text:
- The statement mentions "Sample under examination has size of 20" and "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" - this doesn't clearly indicate if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP
- The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings" - this means malignancy cannot be determined
- The statement says "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point" - so no Gleason grade is available

Since the sample type cannot be determined from the text and malignancy status is unclear, I'll structure this as:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
