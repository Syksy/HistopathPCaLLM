Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" which indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found" - so no malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, Gleason grade is not applicable
