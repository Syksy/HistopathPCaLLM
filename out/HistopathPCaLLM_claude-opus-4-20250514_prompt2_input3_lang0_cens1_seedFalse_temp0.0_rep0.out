Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which suggests a substantial amount of tissue. This volume is consistent with either TURP or RP procedures (biopsies typically yield much smaller amounts). However, without explicit mention of the procedure type, I cannot definitively determine which it is.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This means they could not determine whether malignancy was present or not.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was identified (due to inability to examine the tissue properly), no Gleason grade can be assigned.
