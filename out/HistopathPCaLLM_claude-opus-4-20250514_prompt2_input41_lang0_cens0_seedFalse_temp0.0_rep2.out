Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "systematic biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" - so there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (no cancer), there is no Gleason grade to report.
