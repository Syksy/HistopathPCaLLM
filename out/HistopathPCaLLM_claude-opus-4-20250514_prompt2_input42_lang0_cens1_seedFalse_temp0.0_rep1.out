Looking at the statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared. Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined."

Based on the analysis:
- The sample type is not clearly specified (could be biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- The malignancy status is explicitly uncertain - they cannot determine if it's cancer or inflammation
- No Gleason grade is reported

Since the statement indicates uncertainty about whether malignant tumor is present ("cannot be determined"), this represents an indeterminate finding rather than a definitive yes or no.
