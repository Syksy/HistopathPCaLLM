Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" which is characteristic terminology for TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material" - indicating no malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no adenocarcinoma, no Gleason grade is applicable
