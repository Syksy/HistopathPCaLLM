Looking at this histopathological statement:

"Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The mention of "30g prostate samples" suggests this is likely from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this weight is typical for TURP specimens
2. Malignancy: The statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" - this means malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is confirmed, Gleason grading is not applicable
