Looking at the provided statement:

"Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "30g prostate samples" which suggests a larger tissue volume consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate), as biopsies are typically much smaller.

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," indicating that malignancy cannot be determined from this sample.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy can be determined, there is no Gleason grade to report.
