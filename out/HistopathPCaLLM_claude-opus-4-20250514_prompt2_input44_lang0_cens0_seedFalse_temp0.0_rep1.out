Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate biopsies" - so this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no tumor tissue can be seen" and "Nothing suspicious" - indicating no malignant findings in the current sample.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is found in this sample, Gleason grade is not applicable.
