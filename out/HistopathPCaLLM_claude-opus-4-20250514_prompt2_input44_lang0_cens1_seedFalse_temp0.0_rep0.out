Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" but doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. However, the note at the end states "Earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," suggesting this is likely a follow-up biopsy. Given the sampling method described and the context, this appears to be a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes," which means no malignant tumor was found in this sample.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, there is no Gleason grade to report.
