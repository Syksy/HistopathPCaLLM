Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" but doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Given the context and mention of "Earlier biopsies," this appears to be a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" - this means no malignant tumor findings in the current sample.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found in this sample, there is no Gleason grade to report.
