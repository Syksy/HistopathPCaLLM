Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue focus" and mentions Gleason grading, clearly indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "classes 3+4" when describing the gland structures in the tumor focus. While "tissue gleason 3" is mentioned later regarding perineural invasion, the primary tumor focus is graded as 3+4, which equals 7.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
