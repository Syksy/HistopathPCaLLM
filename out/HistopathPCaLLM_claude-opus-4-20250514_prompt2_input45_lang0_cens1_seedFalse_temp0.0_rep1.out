Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample" and describes multiple sections (E, F, G, O, P), mentions "seminal vesicles," "capsule intact," and "lymph nodes in the area." This comprehensive examination pattern is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "suspect" tissue with "fusing tissue focus" and notes that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" with "further inspection needed." Importantly, it does NOT definitively report adenocarcinoma or malignant findings. The unclear nature and need for further inspection indicate this is inconclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive malignancy is reported, no Gleason grade can be assigned.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
