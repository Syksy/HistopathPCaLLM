Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "A suspect prostate sample" without specifying if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. However, the presence of "Seminal vesicles" and "lymph nodes" indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy specimen, as these structures are only examined in RP specimens, not in biopsies or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "fusing tissue focus" and mentions that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" with "Further inspection is needed." There is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. The findings are inconclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported in this statement.

Since the findings are inconclusive and no definitive diagnosis is made, I'll use "NA" for malignancy and Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
