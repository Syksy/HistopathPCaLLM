Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" which clearly indicates no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign specimen with no cancer, there is no Gleason grade to report.
