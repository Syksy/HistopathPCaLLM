Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. The sample type is "TURP" (transurethral resection of prostate) based on "shaved prostate chippings" which is characteristic of TURP specimens

2. Malignancy is "no" as explicitly stated: "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"

3. Gleason grade is "NA" since this is a benign specimen with no malignancy

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
