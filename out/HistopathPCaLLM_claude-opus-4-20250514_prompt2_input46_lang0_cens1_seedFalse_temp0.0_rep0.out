Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate material" and describes tissue processing typical of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) - material is measured in aggregate size, set on cassettes, and a portion is examined. This is characteristic of TURP specimens rather than biopsies or radical prostatectomy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," indicating that malignancy could not be determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grade can be assigned.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",

  "Gleason": "NA"
}
