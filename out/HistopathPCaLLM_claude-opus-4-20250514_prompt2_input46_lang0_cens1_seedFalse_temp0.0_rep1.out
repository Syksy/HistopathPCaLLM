Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate material" and describes tissue processing typical of a biopsy or small tissue sample, but doesn't explicitly state the procedure type (biopsy, RP, or TURP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not," indicating that malignancy could not be determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grade can be assigned.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
