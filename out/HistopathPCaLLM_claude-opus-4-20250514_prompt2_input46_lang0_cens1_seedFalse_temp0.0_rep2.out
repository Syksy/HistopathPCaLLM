Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate material" without specifying the collection method (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so this is "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not", indicating an inconclusive result, so this is "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned, so this is "NA"
