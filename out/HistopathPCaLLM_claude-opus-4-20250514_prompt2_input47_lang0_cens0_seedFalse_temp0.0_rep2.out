Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "three biopsies from the right and three from the left" - clearly indicating this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No malign findings on the left or the right" - indicating no malignancy was found.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found (this is a benign finding), there would be no Gleason grade to report.
