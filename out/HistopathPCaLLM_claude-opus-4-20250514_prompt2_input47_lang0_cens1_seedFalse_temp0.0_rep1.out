Looking at this histopathological statement:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Examined sample material from the right and the left" and "Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore, the sample type cannot be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This indicates that the presence of malignancy could not be determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grade can be assigned.
