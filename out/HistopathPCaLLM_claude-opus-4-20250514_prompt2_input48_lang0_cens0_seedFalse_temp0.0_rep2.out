Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" and describes a complete prostate specimen with apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles. This indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" - this confirms malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text describes two tumor foci, but ends with "SUMMARY: Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since I should report only the most severe lesion, and the summary indicates Gleason 9, I need to determine the pattern. The second focus is described as "Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4" which would give us 5+4=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
