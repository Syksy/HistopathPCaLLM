Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), so this should be "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns" but explicitly states these are "for educational purposes" and that "this is not used to derive differentiation scores". There's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so this should be "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states they are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)", so no Gleason grade is reported. This should be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
