Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "changes that warrant further investigation" but explicitly states that "assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations." This means no definitive diagnosis of malignancy can be made from this statement. Therefore, this is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is confirmed and the findings cannot be properly assessed, no Gleason grade can be determined. Therefore, this is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
