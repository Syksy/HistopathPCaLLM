Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. The text clearly states "prostate biopsies" were taken, indicating the sample type
2. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue is observed" and "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma", indicating no malignancy
3. Since no malignancy was found, there would be no Gleason grade to report

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
