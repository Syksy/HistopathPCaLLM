Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate biopsies" multiple times
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "benign prostate tissue is observed" and "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma"
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
