Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sampling sites" and "sample" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "no notable atypic patterns are present" but also states "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma." This means they couldn't definitively rule out malignancy due to insufficient material. Therefore: "NA"

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was detected and the assessment was incomplete, there is no Gleason grade. Therefore: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
