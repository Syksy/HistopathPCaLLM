Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "radical prostatectomy" which is an RP (radical prostatectomy) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly states "cancerous tissue is observed" in the apex sections, confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Two different Gleason patterns are reported:
   - Macro A: 4+3
   - Macro B: 4+5 (with sum of 9 mentioned)
   
   Since I need to report only the most severe lesion, and Gleason 4+5=9 is more severe than 4+3=7, I should report 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
