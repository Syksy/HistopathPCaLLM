Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate" and describes systematic sampling from different regions (left/right, apex/basis) with color coding. This systematic approach and the mention of an "enlarged prostate" suggests this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." The mention of Gleason grading indicates that malignant tissue is present, as Gleason grading is only applied to prostate adenocarcinoma. The inability to determine the grades doesn't negate the presence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that the Gleason grades "could not be inferred," so this should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
