Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate" and describes extensive sampling from different regions (left/right, apex/basis) with processing details. This comprehensive sampling approach is characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." The mention of Gleason grading indicates that malignant tumor was found, as Gleason grading is only applied to prostate adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason grade**: While malignancy is present (hence the attempt at Gleason grading), the text explicitly states that the major and minor Gleason patterns "could not be inferred." Therefore, no specific Gleason score can be reported.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
