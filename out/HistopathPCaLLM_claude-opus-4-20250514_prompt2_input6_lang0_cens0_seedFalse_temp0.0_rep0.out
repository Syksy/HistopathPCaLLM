Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving chips" which indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this is the typical description for TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." Despite the burn artifact making observation difficult, the pathologist's conclusion points to benign findings with no mention of malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this appears to be a benign specimen (BPH), there would be no Gleason grade to report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
