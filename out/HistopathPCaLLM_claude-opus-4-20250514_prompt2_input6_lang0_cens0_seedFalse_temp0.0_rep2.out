Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "shaving chips" which indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as this is the typical description for TURP specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." This clearly indicates no malignancy was found.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there would be no Gleason grade to report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
