Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material, but doesn't specify if it's RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of prostate). Since the specific type isn't clear, this should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and mentions that results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). Since no malignancy is reported and the examination couldn't be completed properly, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is mentioned, and given the inconclusive nature of the examination, this should be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
