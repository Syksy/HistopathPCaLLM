Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material, but doesn't specify if it's RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP. Since it's fragmented operation material, this could be either type of surgery.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" and mentions that results are "inconclusive" due to technical issues (burn artifact). No malignancy is reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, there would be no Gleason grade.

Given that the results are inconclusive due to technical challenges and the exact surgical procedure type is not specified, the most appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
