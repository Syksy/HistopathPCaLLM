Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but explicitly states "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material." This indicates no confirmed malignant findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was confirmed, there would be no Gleason grading. This is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
