Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" in sample 3, so this is an RP (radical prostatectomy) specimen.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement clearly describes "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" with "invasive properties" and mentions Gleason grading, confirming malignancy is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7"

Here is the structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
