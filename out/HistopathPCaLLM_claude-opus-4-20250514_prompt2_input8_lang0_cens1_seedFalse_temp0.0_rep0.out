Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason patterns" and discusses major and minor grades, which are only used for malignant prostate cancer. Additionally, samples 1 and 2 are noted as "completely free of malignant findings," implying sample 3 (the main sample) does contain malignant findings. Therefore: "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and mentions "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." Since the actual Gleason grades are not provided: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
