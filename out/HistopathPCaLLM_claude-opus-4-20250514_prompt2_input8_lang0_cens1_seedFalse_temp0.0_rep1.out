Looking at this statement, I need to extract:
1. Sample type
2. Malignancy presence
3. Gleason grade

Analysis:
- Sample type: The text mentions "samples" with indices but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore: "NA"

- Malignancy: The statement mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns" which indicates malignancy was found (Gleason grading is only used for malignant prostate cancer). Also, samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings," implying sample 3 (the main sample) had malignant findings. Therefore: "yes"

- Gleason grade: The statement indicates Gleason patterns were identified but states "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and mentions "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." Since the actual Gleason values are missing/not reported: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
