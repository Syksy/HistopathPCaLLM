Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. Therefore: "NA"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason patterns" and discusses major and minor grades, which are only used for malignant prostate cancer. Despite the missing values, the presence of Gleason grading indicates malignancy was found. Therefore: "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and mentions "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." Since the actual Gleason values are missing/not reported, I cannot provide them in the required format. Therefore: "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
