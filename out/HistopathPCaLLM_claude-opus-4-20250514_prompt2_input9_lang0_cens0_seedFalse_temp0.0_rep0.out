Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "electrosection shavings" and describes a procedure where tissue is removed in shavings/chips, which is characteristic of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings are observed" and concludes with "benign hyperplasia."

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, there is no Gleason grade to report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
