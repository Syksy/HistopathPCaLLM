Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue, prepared to be run on casettes following the normal routine. Samples D-G were run for the first tissue batch, second batch in samples K-P, third batch in O-Q. Already in the first part some special patterns of cell growth are observed peripherally, with attention being focused especially on sample material drawn from roughly the prostate capsule border region. It is impossible to assess potential prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status from the current material. The role of the histological traits found in basis and seminal vehicle findings are proposed to be discussed at the next week's uro-meeting to reach a consensus with colleagues. During an earlier meeting, a colleague compared this patient based on his clinical factors to a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient of his, and proposed that a more through-out sampling ought to be conducted to be able to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted, especially before making a statement affecting any potential intervention-decisions.
