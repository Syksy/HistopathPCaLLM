Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies" - this is clearly a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion states "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign" and mentions that "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." No definitive malignancy is reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no definitive carcinoma/adenocarcinoma is diagnosed, no Gleason grading is provided or applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
