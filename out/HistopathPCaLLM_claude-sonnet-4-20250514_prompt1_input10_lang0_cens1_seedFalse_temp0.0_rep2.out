Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the text:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify whether these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedures.

2. Malignancy: The statement discusses technical issues with immunological staining panels and mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations," but these suspicious formations are attributed to staining failures rather than malignant findings. No definitive malignant tumor is reported.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned in this technical/quality control focused report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
