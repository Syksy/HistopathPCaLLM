Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three key fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" that was prepared and run according to standard protocol, with weight measurements and microscopic examination of different prostate sections (basis, apex, mid section). This suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed" and that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated." However, there is no definitive statement of adenocarcinoma or malignancy being detected. The evaluation remains inconclusive.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text explicitly states these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material examination, making any Gleason grading inconclusive.
