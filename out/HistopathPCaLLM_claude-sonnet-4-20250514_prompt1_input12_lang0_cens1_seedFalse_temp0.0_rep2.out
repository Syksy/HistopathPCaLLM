Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue" but doesn't explicitly state whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement indicates this is "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but notes that "high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue," suggesting the examination is incomplete and no definitive malignancy determination has been made yet.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading information is provided in this statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
