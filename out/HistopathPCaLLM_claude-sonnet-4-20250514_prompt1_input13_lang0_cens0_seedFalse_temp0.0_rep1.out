Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies" - this corresponds to "biopsy"

2. Malignancy: The text states "carcinoma is observed" - this indicates "yes" for malignant findings

3. Gleason grade: The text mentions "Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)" - this indicates a Gleason grade of 4+5=9

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
