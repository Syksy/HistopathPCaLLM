Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

From the text:
- "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" suggests this is a biopsy procedure
- The statement mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that needs "further verification via consultation" but does not definitively diagnose malignancy
- No Gleason grade is reported since no definitive malignancy is established

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
