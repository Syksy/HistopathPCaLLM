Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignant findings**: The text clearly describes "tumorous growth" and "carcinoma", indicating malignancy is present

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". This indicates a Gleason sum of 7, where grade 3 represents about 60% (major component) and the remaining would be grade 4 (minor component), making it 3+4=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
