Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and discusses "surgical margin status" and samples being "run on cassettes following the normal routine." This indicates a radical prostatectomy specimen.

2. Malignancy: The statement describes "special patterns of cell growth" and mentions a colleague's comparison to "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," suggesting malignancy is suspected. However, the text explicitly states that "further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted" before making definitive statements, indicating no definitive malignancy determination has been made yet.

3. Gleason grade: While a "Gleason 7 score patient" is mentioned for comparison purposes, no actual Gleason grade is reported for this specific patient. The text indicates further investigation is needed before grading.
