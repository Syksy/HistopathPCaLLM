Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material" clearly indicates malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8." While the complete grade pattern isn't explicitly stated, a Gleason sum of 8 with predominant grade 4 would most commonly be 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
