Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which indicates tissue fragments removed during a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly confirms "adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material."

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." While the individual components aren't explicitly stated as "X+Y=8", given that Gleason 4 is described as "most represented" and the sum is 8, this most likely represents a 4+4=8 pattern.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
