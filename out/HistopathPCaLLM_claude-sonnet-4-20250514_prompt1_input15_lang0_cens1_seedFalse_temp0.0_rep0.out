Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion findings.

Analyzing the key elements:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify whether it's from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Since no specific procedure is mentioned, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: While clinical notes mention "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma," the pathologist explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that findings "have to be revised in the next histologic examination session." No definitive malignant tumor findings are confirmed in this report.

3. **Gleason grade**: The pathologist clearly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." Although clinical notes mentioned suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, this was explicitly noted as "not based on any histopathology."

  "Sampletype": "NA",

  "Gleason": "NA"
