Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate" - this clearly indicates a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carcinoma focuses" and discusses Gleason grading, which confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "finding of score 7" and describes "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Since architecture 3 (Gleason 3) is the predominant pattern and architecture 4 (Gleason 4) is the secondary pattern, this gives us a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
