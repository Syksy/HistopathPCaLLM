Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but doesn't explicitly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspicious foci" and discusses "various grades of cell differentiation" and potential "mid-grade differentiation," but explicitly states that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive" and that proper assessment needs to be done manually. No definitive malignancy determination is made.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement specifically mentions that grading is "inconclusive due to resolution issues" and references potential "3+4 or 4+3" grades only as examples of what would be difficult to assess, not as actual findings.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
