Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and describes systematic sampling with labels A-O, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens where the entire prostate is sectioned and mapped.

2. Malignancy: This appears to be a preliminary report describing the processing and preparation of samples. No definitive malignant findings are reported - only that assessment will be done to determine "if the material is fully healthy" and mentions this will be completed by resident candidates in a future session.

3. Gleason grade: No actual Gleason score is reported. The text only mentions that "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present" will be assessed, but no final grading is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
