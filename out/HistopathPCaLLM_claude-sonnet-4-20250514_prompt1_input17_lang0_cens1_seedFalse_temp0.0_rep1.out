Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and describes systematic sampling with labels A-O, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens where the entire prostate is sectioned and mapped.

2. Malignancy: This appears to be a preliminary report describing the processing and preparation of samples. No definitive malignant findings are reported - only that assessment will be done to determine "if the material is fully healthy" and mentions potential Gleason grading "between 3 to 5" as possibilities to be evaluated.

3. Gleason grade: No actual Gleason score is reported, only mention that assessment for "Gleason between 3 to 5" will be performed.

Since this is a preliminary processing report without definitive diagnostic findings, the malignancy status and Gleason grade are not available.
