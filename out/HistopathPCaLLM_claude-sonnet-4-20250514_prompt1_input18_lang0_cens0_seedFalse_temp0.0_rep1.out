Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" - this describes a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chips/shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma" and mentions "neoplastic" portions, confirming malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This indicates the major pattern is grade 3 (60% of tumor), and since the sum is 7, the minor pattern must be grade 4 (3+4=7).

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
