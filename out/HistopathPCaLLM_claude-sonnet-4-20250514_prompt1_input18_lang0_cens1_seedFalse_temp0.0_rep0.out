Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "standard prostate related procedures" but doesn't specify whether it's biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since it's not explicitly stated, this would be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes mostly benign findings (>95% appears benign) with a suspicious focus that is "too small to properly assign a grade group." Since no definitive malignancy is confirmed, this would be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No definitive Gleason grade is assigned since the suspicious area is described as "too small to properly assign a grade group." This would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
