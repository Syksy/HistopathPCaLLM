Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but doesn't explicitly specify whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Since the specific type isn't clearly stated, this would be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes samples 2 and 3 as "healthy benign prostate tissue" and sample 4 as having "cell architectures that may differ from normal" with uncertainty about whether it's "possibly malignant." However, there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy - it's described as uncertain and requiring further verification. Since there's no confirmed malignant tumor finding, this would be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement, as there's no confirmed malignancy. This would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
