Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" but doesn't specify if they're from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Since no specific procedure is mentioned, this is "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region" because the tissue samples have been highly affected by previous treatments. No definitive malignant findings are reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: No actual Gleason grade is reported. The text mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but this is presented as a theoretical example, not an actual finding.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
