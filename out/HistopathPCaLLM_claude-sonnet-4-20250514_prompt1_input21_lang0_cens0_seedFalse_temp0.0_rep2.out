Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" indicates tissue removed during a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "poorly differentiated growth," "enlarged nuclei," and "tumor-like tissue," which indicates malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement indicates "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4," which translates to a primary grade of 5 and secondary grade of 4.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
