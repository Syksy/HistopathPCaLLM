Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "extracted prostate material" with fragments measured in grams and millimeters, which is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes technical issues with specimen preparation (dissolved nuclei, technical noise) that prevent proper assessment of cell differentiation patterns. No definitive malignancy is identified, and the pathologist indicates the material needs to be revisited after quality control.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is definitively identified due to technical issues, no Gleason grading is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
