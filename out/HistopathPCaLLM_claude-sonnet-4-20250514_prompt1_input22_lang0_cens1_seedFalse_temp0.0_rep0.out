Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion regarding sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

From the text:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragments from left and right sides, which indicates this is a biopsy procedure.

2. Malignancy: The pathologist explicitly states that "the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies" - meaning no definitive determination of malignancy could be made.

3. Gleason grade: The statement mentions that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and no actual Gleason score is provided due to the inability to properly assess the tissue.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
