Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prepared sample set" and "macro sections" but doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. However, the context suggests tissue samples were taken for investigation.

2. Malignant findings: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior incomplete report, but this current report doesn't confirm malignancy - it's requesting reprocessing to validate initial suspicions.

3. Gleason grade: While "potential Gleason 3" is mentioned from a prior report, this current statement doesn't provide a definitive Gleason score as it's inconclusive pending reprocessing.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
