Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three key pieces of information:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "turp-chippings" which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates malignant findings - it mentions "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma."

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Since Gleason sum 8 can be either 4+4=8 or 3+5=8, and the text specifically mentions "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" suggesting predominant grade 4 pattern, the most likely interpretation is 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
