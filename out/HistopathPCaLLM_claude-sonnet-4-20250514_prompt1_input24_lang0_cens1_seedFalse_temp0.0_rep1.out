Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify information about the most severe lesion mentioned.

From the text, I can extract:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings" - multiple types are mentioned, but since radical prostatectomy (RP) represents the most comprehensive sampling method among those listed, this would be the most relevant.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions that some cases were "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" - Gleason scoring indicates malignancy is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The most severe grade mentioned is "3+4" (which equals 7), as this is higher than "3+3" (which equals 6).

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
