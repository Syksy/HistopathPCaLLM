Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "tissue cylinders" with measurements in millimeters (8+6mm, 10mm, 5+5mm), which is characteristic of needle biopsy cores.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion explicitly states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma," indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Both samples (1) and (2) contain tumor with Gleason patterns 3 and 4. Since only the most severe lesion should be reported, and both samples have the same patterns, the Gleason score would be 4+3=7 (primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 3, based on the percentages described).

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
