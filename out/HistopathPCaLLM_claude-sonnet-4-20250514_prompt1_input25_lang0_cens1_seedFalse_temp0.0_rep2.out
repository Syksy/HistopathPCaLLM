Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "tissue sample" and "fragmented tissue material" but doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. However, the context of multiple small samples with measurements in millimeters and the mention of a "uro-meeting" suggests this is most likely a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion explicitly states "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified" - this indicates no definitive malignant findings were established.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no adenocarcinoma was reliably verified, no Gleason grading would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
