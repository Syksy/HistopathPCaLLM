Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "widely spread tumor" and discusses Gleason grades, confirming malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent" - this indicates Gleason pattern 3 is dominant with significant pattern 4, which would be reported as 3+4=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
