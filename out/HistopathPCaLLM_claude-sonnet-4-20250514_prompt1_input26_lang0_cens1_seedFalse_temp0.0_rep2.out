Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "material originates from the prostate" with samples marked A-C (apex) and D-F (basis), which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: While clinical notes mention "possible 'Gleason sum 7'", the pathologist states the material is "very difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy" and that "it is unclear" if this was verified. Since the histological assessment cannot definitively confirm malignancy due to radiation effects, this should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Although a "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned in clinical notes, the pathologist explicitly states it's unclear if this was verified and that the histopathology cannot be reasonably assessed due to radiation therapy effects. Therefore, this should be "NA".

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
