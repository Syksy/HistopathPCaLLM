Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "source prostate tissue" but doesn't specify biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The description of "dozen grams" and "eight batches" suggests a substantial amount of tissue, but the exact procedure isn't clearly stated.

2. Malignancy: The statement mentions "growth patterns" that "did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation" and "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." This suggests possible malignant findings, though with uncertainty.

3. Gleason grade: Only mentions "Gleason score 3" in small quantities with uncertainty ("debatably" and "could maybe be seen"). No complete Gleason score with major+minor components is provided.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
