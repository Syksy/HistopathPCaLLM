Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g" and describes systematic sampling of different planes and lobes. This indicates a complete prostate removal, which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy).

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" - this indicates malignant findings are present, so "yes".

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (appears to be a typo - likely meant grade 3 for the smaller portion), and concludes with "Score sum 7". Based on the context and sum of 7, this would be "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
