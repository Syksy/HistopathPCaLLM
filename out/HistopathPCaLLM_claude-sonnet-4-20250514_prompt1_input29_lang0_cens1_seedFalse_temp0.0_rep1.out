Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" with systematic sampling (A-F from different anatomical locations), which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) procedure.

2. Malignancy: The text mentions "differentiation stages of tumor cells" and requests assessment of "potential poor differentiation and possible fusing glandular structure observations," suggesting tumor presence, but no definitive malignancy diagnosis is stated. The samples were contaminated and need re-examination.

3. Gleason grade: The summary explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible" due to the contaminated samples requiring re-examination.

Since this appears to be an inconclusive report due to contaminated samples, with no definitive malignancy determination or Gleason scoring possible:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
