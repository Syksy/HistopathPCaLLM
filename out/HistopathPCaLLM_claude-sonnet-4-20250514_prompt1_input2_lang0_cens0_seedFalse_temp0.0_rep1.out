Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "fresh prostatectomy specimen" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignant findings**: The microscopic examination shows "normal benign growth," "atrophy and spot-like inflammation," and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia." The summary confirms "no tumor growth" and attributes changes to "normal aging" - this indicates no malignancy

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no adenocarcinoma detected, no Gleason grading is applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
