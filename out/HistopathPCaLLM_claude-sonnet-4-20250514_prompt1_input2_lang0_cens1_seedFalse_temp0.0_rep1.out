Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), so this would be "NA".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement indicates that "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and mentions they "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma" - this suggests no definitive malignant findings were established, so "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was definitively identified, no Gleason grade is reported, so "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
