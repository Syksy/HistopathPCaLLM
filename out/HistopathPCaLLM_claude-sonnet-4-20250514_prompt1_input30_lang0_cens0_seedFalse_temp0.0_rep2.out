Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells" - this indicates TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, as chippings are characteristic of TURP samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" and discusses Gleason grading, indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text states "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3" - following the convention of reporting the most common pattern first, this would be 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
