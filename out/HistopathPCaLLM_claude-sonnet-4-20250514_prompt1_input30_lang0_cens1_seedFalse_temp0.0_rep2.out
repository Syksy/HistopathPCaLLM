Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

This statement describes an additional consultation regarding uncertain/atypical findings where the consultants could not confirm or deny suspicions of malignancy. There is no mention of:
- Sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP)
- Confirmed malignant tumor findings
- Gleason grading

Since this is an inconclusive consultation note without definitive findings, all three fields should be marked as "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
