Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify the most severe lesion findings:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies" - this is clearly a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: Yes, malignant tumor is present. The statement describes adenocarcinoma with Gleason patterns and mentions "aggressive tumor characteristics."

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple Gleason scores are mentioned:
   - Initial finding: Gleason 3+3=6
   - Most recent/severe finding: Primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5
   
   Since I need to report the most severe lesion, this would be Gleason 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
