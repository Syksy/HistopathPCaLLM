Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "samples were taken" but doesn't specify if these were biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP samples.

2. Malignant findings: The text mentions "suspicious findings" but states that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult" and recommends "additional samples" - this indicates no definitive malignancy was established.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned in the statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
