Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "radical prostatectomy" - this corresponds to "RP"

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" with various Gleason patterns, indicating malignant findings - this is "yes"

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple patterns are mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3). The most severe lesion has Gleason 4+4 pattern, which equals 4+4=8

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
