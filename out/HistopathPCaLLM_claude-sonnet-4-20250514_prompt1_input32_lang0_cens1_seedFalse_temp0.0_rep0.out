Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the text:
- The statement mentions "original primary prostate tissue" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP
- The mention of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear" suggests this might be from a radical prostatectomy specimen, as these structures are typically examined in that context
- However, there is no explicit statement about malignancy being present or absent
- No Gleason grading information is provided
- The statement appears to be an update or summary rather than a primary diagnostic report

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
