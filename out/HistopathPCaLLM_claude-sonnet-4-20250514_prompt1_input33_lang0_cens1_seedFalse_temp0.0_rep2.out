Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion regarding sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the statement:
- No specific sample type is mentioned (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
- The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and doesn't report any malignant findings elsewhere
- No Gleason grade is provided, which is consistent with no malignancy being reported

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
