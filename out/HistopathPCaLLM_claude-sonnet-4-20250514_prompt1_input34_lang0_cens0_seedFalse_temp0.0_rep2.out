Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "resection weighing 7.5gr" - this indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities" - this clearly indicates no malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, no Gleason grade would be reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
