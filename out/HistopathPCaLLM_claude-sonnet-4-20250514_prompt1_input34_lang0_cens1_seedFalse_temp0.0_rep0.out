Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze each component:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions tissue preparation and histological examination but doesn't explicitly state "biopsy," "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP." However, the weight (7.5gr) and preparation method suggest this could be from a TURP procedure, but since it's not explicitly stated, I'll mark as "NA."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and notes that "findings do not indicate prostatic [malignancy]." No adenocarcinoma or malignant findings are mentioned. This indicates benign findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, there would be no Gleason grading applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
