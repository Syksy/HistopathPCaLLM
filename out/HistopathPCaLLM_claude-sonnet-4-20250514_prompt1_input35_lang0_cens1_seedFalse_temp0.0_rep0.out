Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "samples are from left and right lobe" but doesn't explicitly state the procedure type (biopsy, RP, TURP)

2. Malignancy: The findings describe "high-grade PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and "hyperplasia" but no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is reported, no Gleason grading would be applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
