Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The specimen weight (80gr) and size (7 x 6 x 5 cm) indicate this is a substantial tissue sample, consistent with a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The findings describe "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" 
3. The statement explicitly notes "No signs of malignity"
4. No Gleason grade is mentioned, which is appropriate since no malignancy was found
