Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample size and weight" and describes macroscopic examination with cassette preparation, which suggests this is likely a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. Given the mention of nodular hyperplasia (typical of prostate enlargement) and the extensive processing (8 macro cassettes + 5 regular cassettes), this appears to be a TURP specimen.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement only mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" with no mention of adenocarcinoma, malignancy, or Gleason grading. These are benign findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grade is reported since no malignancy was found.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
