Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze:

1. **Sample type**: "7g of electrosection chippings" indicates tissue removed via electrosurgery, which is characteristic of TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate)

2. **Malignancy**: The findings describe "hyperplasia" (benign enlargement) with "nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation" - no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding (hyperplasia), no Gleason grading applies

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
