Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The examination describes "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation" but makes no mention of adenocarcinoma, malignancy, or cancer. The statement also notes that "further examination was not possible at this time" and samples will be "examined further next week," indicating an incomplete examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, which is consistent with no malignancy being reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
