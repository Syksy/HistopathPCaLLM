Looking at this histopathological statement, I can extract the following information:

1. Sample type: "Representative needle biopsies" indicates this is a biopsy
2. Malignancy: "No suspected malignity" clearly indicates no malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found, this would be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
