Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of prostate).

2. Malignancy: The findings describe "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" - these are benign findings with no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is reported, only benign hyperplastic tissue and inflammation, no Gleason grading would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
