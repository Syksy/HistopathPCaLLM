Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "a tumor with 3 foci" and mentions Gleason grading, which clearly indicates malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement indicates "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages" with "Gleason grade is 7". Since Gleason 3 is mentioned as the major pattern and 4 as the minor pattern, this would be 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
