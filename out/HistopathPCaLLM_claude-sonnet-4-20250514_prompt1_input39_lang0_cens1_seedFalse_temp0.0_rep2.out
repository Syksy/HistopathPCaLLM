Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "slices extracted" and "remaining tissue run according to normal routine" with a sample size of 20, which suggests this is likely from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, but it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings," indicating uncertainty about malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement clearly states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
