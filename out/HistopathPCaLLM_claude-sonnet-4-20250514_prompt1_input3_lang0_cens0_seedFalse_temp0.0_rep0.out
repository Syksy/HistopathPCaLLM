Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The sample consists of "prostate chippings" weighing 12.3g, which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The histological inspection shows "chronic inflammation" and "stromal hyperplasia" 
3. The statement explicitly concludes "Nothing indicating malignancy is found"
4. Since no malignancy is present, no Gleason grade would be reported
