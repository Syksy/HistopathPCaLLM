Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" which indicates a large volume of tissue removed in a single procedure. This is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate).

2. Malignancy: The statement mentions "inflammation" but explicitly states that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination" and "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." No malignancy is mentioned or detected.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found/reported, this would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
