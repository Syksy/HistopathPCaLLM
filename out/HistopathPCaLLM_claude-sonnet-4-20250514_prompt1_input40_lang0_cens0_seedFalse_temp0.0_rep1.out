Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The mention of "shaving material" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The findings show "hyperplastic prostate tissue" with "no atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and a summary of "Benign prostate hyperplasia," indicating no malignancy
3. Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade is applicable
