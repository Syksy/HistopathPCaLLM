Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "material weights 8.9" and "approx 8 casettes are used" - this weight and multiple cassettes suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as biopsies and TURP specimens are typically much smaller.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate" and "inflammation, but possibly something else" with a note that "further examination is needed." There is no definitive mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy - only uncertainty requiring further examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement, and since malignancy is not definitively established, this would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
