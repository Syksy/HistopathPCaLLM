Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "systematic biopsies" which indicates this is a biopsy procedure
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" 
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found, this would be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
