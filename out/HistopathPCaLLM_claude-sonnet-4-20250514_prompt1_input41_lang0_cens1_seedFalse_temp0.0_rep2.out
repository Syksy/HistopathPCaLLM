Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate" but doesn't specify the collection method (biopsy, RP, or TURP).

2. Malignant findings: The statement describes "little chronic inflammation," "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation," and explicitly states it's "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This indicates no definitive malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is identified, no Gleason grading is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
