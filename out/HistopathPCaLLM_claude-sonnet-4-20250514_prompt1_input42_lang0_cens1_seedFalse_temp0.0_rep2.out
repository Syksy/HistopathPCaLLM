Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate sample weighing app 8?" - this appears to be describing a prostate specimen with a weight measurement, which is typical of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly says "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined" - this indicates uncertainty about malignancy, so the answer is "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grade is provided or applicable, so the answer is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
