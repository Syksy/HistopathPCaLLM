Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. "Approx 30g prostate chippings" indicates this is material from a TURP procedure
2. "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma" clearly indicates no malignant findings
3. Since no malignancy was found, no Gleason grade would be reported

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
