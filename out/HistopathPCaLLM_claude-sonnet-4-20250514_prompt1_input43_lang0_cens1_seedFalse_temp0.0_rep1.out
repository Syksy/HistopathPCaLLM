Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. Sample type: The mention of "30g prostate samples" indicates this is from a surgical resection, most likely a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) given the weight and context.

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," indicating no malignant findings were identified.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading would be applicable.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
