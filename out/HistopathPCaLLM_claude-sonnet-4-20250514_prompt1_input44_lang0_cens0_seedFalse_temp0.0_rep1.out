Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine" - this clearly indicates biopsy samples.

2. Malignancy: The current findings state "Normally structured prostate tissue", "Nothing suspicious", and "now no tumor tissue can be seen" - indicating no malignant findings in the current sample.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found in the current sample, this would be "NA" for a benign statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
