Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" and references "Earlier biopsies" - this indicates the current samples are from a biopsy procedure.

2. Malignant findings: The statement explicitly says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes" in the current samples, and only describes benign findings (normal tissue, chronic inflammation, atrophy). While earlier biopsies showed cancer, this current report shows no malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is reported in the current samples, no Gleason grade is provided.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
