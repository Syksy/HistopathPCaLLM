Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate as sample" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue focus" and mentions "Perineural invasion" and "Gleason" grading, which clearly indicates malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "classes 3+4" and "tissue gleason 3". The "classes 3+4" appears to refer to the Gleason pattern combination, making this 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
