Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample" with sections labeled with letters (E, F, G, O, P) and references to seminal vesicles, negative margins, intact capsule, and lymph nodes. This pattern is characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "suspect" sample with "fusing tissue focus" and notes that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" with "further inspection needed." There is no definitive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or malignancy stated.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is definitively identified, no Gleason grading is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
