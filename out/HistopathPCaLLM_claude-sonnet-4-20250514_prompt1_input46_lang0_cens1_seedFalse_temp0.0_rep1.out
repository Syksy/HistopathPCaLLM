Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate material" but doesn't specify if it's from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not" - indicating no definitive malignancy was identified.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, and since no malignancy was confirmed, this would be NA.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
