Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Examined sample material" with measurements in what appears to be length (30+40=70, likely mm), which is typical of biopsy cores rather than whole specimens.

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right" - this indicates the pathologist cannot definitively determine if malignancy is present.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was definitively identified, no Gleason grading would be provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
