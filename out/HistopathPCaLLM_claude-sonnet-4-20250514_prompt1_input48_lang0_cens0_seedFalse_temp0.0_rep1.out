Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma" found in the specimen, indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement describes two tumor foci:
   - First focus: most common Gleason 4, next common 3
   - Second focus: Gleason 5 (>80%) with small portion of Gleason 4
   
   The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since I need to report the most severe lesion, and the second focus has Gleason 5 as the predominant pattern (>80%) with Gleason 4 as the minor pattern, this would be 5+4=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
