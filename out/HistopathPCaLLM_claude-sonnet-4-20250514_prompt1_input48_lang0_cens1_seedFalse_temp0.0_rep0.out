Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: This describes "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP), so this would be "NA"

2. Malignancy: The statement mentions "histological changes" and "interesting findings" but explicitly states this material is for educational purposes and notes they are "unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals." There's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so this would be "no"

3. Gleason grade: The statement explicitly says "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)" - so no Gleason grade is reported, making this "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
