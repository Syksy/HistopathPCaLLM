Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings" which are characteristic terminology for TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "5 shavings contained carcinoma" - so malignancy is present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement indicates "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." Following standard Gleason scoring convention where the most common (primary) pattern is listed first, this would be reported as 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
