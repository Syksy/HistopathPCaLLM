Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" but doesn't specify whether these are from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of prostate).

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement mentions "some changes that warrant further investigation" but explicitly states that "assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations." No definitive malignancy is reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
