Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement clearly mentions "prostate biopsies"
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" and describes the tissue as "benign"
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy is found, this would be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
