Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample part" and "sampled tissue" - this language is consistent with a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly says "no notable atypic patterns are present" and indicates the sample is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma" - this means no malignancy was detected.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, there would be no Gleason grading reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
