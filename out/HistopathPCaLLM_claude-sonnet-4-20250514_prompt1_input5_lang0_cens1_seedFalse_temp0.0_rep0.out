Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate" and describes detailed sampling with dye marking and sectioning from apex and basis, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes" and "suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection," which indicates the presence of malignant findings that require Gleason grading.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," meaning no specific Gleason score is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
