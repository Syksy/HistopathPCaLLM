Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The sample consists of "shaving chips" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The findings describe "benign prostate hyperplasia" with no mention of malignancy or adenocarcinoma
3. Since this is a benign finding, no Gleason grade would be reported

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
