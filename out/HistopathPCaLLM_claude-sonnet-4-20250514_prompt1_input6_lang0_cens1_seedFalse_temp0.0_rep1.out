Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostatic operation material" which indicates surgical material from a prostate operation, most likely a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "The results are therefore inconclusive" due to technical challenges with burn artifacts, meaning malignancy cannot be determined.

3. Gleason grade: Since the results are inconclusive and no malignancy is definitively identified, no Gleason grade is reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
