Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies" - this is clearly a biopsy.

2. Malignancy: The text describes "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" but states "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." This indicates suspicion but not a definitive malignant diagnosis.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is provided in the statement, as there is no definitive malignant diagnosis.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
