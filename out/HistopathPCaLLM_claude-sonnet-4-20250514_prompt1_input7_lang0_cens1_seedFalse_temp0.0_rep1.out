Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

From the text:
- "prostate sample material was routinely collected" suggests this is a biopsy procedure
- "atypical structures and morphological changes" were noted but "no definite conclusions could be drawn"
- No mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy
- No Gleason grading provided

Since no definite malignancy was identified and no Gleason grade was assigned, this appears to be an inconclusive/benign finding.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
