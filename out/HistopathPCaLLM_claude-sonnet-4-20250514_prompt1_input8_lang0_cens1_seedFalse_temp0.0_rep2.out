Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

From the text:
- Sample type: The statement mentions "majority of the prostate tissue of interest" and references "samples" with indices, suggesting this is from a prostate biopsy procedure
- Malignancy: The text states "samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings" and mentions "suspicion of PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) but no definitive malignancy is reported
- Gleason grade: The text mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart" and "no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap" - indicating no actual Gleason score is provided

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
