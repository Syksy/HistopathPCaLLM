Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "electrosection shavings" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings are observed" and concludes with "benign hyperplasia."

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found, this would be "NA."

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
