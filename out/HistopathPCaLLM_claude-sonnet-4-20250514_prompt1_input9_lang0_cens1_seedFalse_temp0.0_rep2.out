Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "A few dozen grams total of sample material" and describes "Large quantities of prostate tissue." The large quantity (dozens of grams) suggests this is from a surgical procedure rather than a biopsy. Given the context and amount of tissue, this appears to be from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and mentions some disproportionate glandular structures attributed to "technical difficulties in processing." There is no mention of adenocarcinoma, malignancy, or cancer. The abnormalities noted are attributed to processing issues, not pathological findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, there would be no Gleason grading.
