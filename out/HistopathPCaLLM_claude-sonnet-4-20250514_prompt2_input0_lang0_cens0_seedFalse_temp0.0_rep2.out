Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Chipping samples" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, which produces tissue chips/chippings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and describes "benign prostate tissue," indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy detected, no Gleason grading applies.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
