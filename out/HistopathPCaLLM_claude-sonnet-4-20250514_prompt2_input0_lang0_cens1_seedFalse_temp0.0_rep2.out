Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample material was obtained" and "prostate tissue was observed" but does not specify whether this was from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted" and "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn." This indicates no malignant findings were identified.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, and since no malignancy was found, no Gleason score would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
