Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly mentions "prostate systematic biopsies" - this indicates biopsy samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion states "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign" and mentions that "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." This indicates no definitive malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no carcinoma was definitively diagnosed and the conclusion leans towards benign, no Gleason grade is reported.
