Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "prostate systematic biopsies" - this indicates biopsy samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion states "leaning towards benign" and mentions "the diagnosis is uncertain" with only "suspicion-level finding" but no definitive carcinoma diagnosis. Since no malignant tumor is definitively identified, this would be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement, as there is no confirmed malignancy.
