Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but doesn't specify whether these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses technical issues with sample processing and immunological staining reliability. It mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" related to staining failures, but does not report any malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in this statement.

This appears to be a technical report about sample processing issues rather than a diagnostic histopathological report with clinical findings.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
