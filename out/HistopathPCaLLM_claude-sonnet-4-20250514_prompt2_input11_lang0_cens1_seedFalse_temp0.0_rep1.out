Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the text:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol" and discusses "prostate tissue" but doesn't explicitly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The text describes prostate tissue with "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions that "Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed." This suggests potential malignancy was considered but could not be confirmed. The evaluation remains "inconclusive" and no definitive cancer diagnosis is stated.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, the text explicitly states these "could not be reliably assessed" due to limited material (only 5% could be investigated). No actual Gleason grade is assigned.

This appears to be an inconclusive pathology report where malignancy could not be definitively determined.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA", 
"Gleason": "NA"
}
