Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. Sample type: "electrosection shavings from the prostate" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "the material is classified as benign" and describes "normal prostate tissue like architecture"
3. Gleason grade: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy, no Gleason grading is applicable

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
