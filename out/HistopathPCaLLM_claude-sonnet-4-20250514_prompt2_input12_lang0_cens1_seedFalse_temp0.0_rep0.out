Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue" that "has been started in eight batches" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. Malignancy: While there is "suspected prostate cancer tissue," the statement indicates that "high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue," meaning the examination is incomplete and no definitive malignancy determination has been made yet.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading information is provided in the statement.

Since this appears to be a preliminary or incomplete pathology report without definitive findings, the appropriate response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
