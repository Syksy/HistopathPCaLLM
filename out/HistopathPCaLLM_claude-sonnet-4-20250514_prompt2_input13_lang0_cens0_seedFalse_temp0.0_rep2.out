Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies" which indicates this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly states "carcinoma is observed" which indicates malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)" which provides the Gleason score in the required format.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
