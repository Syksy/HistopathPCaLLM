Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" which suggests a biopsy procedure, but this is not explicitly stated. The phrasing is somewhat ambiguous.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "irregularities," "suspicious pattern," and need for "further verification via consultation," but does not definitively state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The language suggests uncertainty rather than a confirmed malignancy diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned anywhere in the statement.

Given that this statement appears to describe preliminary findings requiring further consultation rather than definitive diagnostic results, and lacks clear diagnostic terminology typically found in structured histopathological reports, I would classify this as not providing definitive structured diagnostic information.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
