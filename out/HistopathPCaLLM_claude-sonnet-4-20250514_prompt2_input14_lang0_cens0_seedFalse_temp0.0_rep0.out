Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostatetectomy preparate" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes "tumorous growth" and "carcinoma," indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%." This indicates a Gleason sum of 7, and since the larger portion (primary pattern) is grade 3 at 60%, the secondary pattern would be grade 4, making it 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
