Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and discusses "samples" run on "casettes" with references to "prostate capsule," "surgical margin status," and systematic sampling (samples D-G, K-P, O-Q). This systematic approach and mention of surgical margins suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. Malignancy: The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references to "Gleason 7 score patient" and "mid-grade GG findings," but states that "Further histopathological investigation is therefore warranted" before making definitive statements. No definitive malignancy is confirmed in this preliminary report.

3. Gleason grade: While there's a reference to comparing with "a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," no actual Gleason grade is reported for this specific specimen. The text indicates further investigation is needed before grading.
