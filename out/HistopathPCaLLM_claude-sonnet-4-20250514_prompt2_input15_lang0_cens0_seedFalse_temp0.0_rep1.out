Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: "does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material" clearly indicates malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8", which indicates a Gleason score of 8. Given that Gleason 4 is the predominant pattern and the sum is 8, this would be 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
