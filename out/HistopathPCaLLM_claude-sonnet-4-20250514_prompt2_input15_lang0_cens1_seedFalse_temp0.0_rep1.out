Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the sample type, malignancy findings, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify whether it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: While clinical notes mention "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma," the pathologist explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that "Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session." This indicates no definitive malignant findings were confirmed in this examination.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement clearly indicates that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." The mention of "Gleason sum of 8 or above" refers only to clinical suspicion, not histopathological findings.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
