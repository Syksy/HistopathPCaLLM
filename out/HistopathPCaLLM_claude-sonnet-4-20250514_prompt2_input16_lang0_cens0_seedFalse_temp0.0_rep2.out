Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate"
2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "carcinoma focuses" and discusses Gleason grading, indicating malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mainly level 3 grade growth" with "some Gleason 4-type of looping structures" and concludes with "finding of score 7" with "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3". This indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7 (since grade 3 is the predominant pattern covering 2/3 of the tumor)

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
