Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but does not specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "suspicious foci" and discusses "cell differentiation" and potential Gleason grading (3+4 or 4+3), which suggests malignant findings are present, though the conclusion is that proper grading cannot be completed due to digitalization issues.

3. **Gleason grade**: While 3+4 and 4+3 are mentioned as examples of what would be difficult to assess, no actual Gleason grade is reported or concluded for this case.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
