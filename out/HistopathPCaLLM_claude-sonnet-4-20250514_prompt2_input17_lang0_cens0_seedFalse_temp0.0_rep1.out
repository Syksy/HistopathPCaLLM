Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Multiple clear foci" of tumor with specific Gleason grades, perineural invasion, and capsular infiltration, clearly indicating malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which corresponds to a Gleason score of 4+3=7
