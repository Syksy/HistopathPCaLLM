Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and describes sample processing with sections labeled A-O, which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as this type of extensive sectioning is characteristic of surgical specimens rather than biopsies.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "if the material is fully healthy" and refers to assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" but does not definitively report the presence of malignant tumor. This appears to be a preliminary report awaiting final assessment.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason grades 3 to 5 are mentioned, no specific Gleason score is reported. The text indicates this is pending further evaluation.

Since this appears to be an incomplete preliminary report without definitive findings, the malignancy and Gleason fields should be marked as "NA".
