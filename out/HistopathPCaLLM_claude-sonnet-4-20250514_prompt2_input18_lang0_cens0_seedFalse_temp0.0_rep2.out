Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" indicates this is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "carcinoma" and "neoplastic" portions, indicating malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" and refers to "stage 3" (which appears to be referring to Gleason grade 3) representing about 60% of the tumor area. Since it's a sum of 7 with grade 3 being the predominant pattern, this would be consistent with Gleason 3+4=7.
