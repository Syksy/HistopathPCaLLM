Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures" but doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The generic description doesn't allow me to determine the specific procedure type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes ">95% of material appears benign" and mentions a "suspicious focus" that "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above" but notes this focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group." This indicates suspicion but no definitive malignant diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No specific Gleason score is provided. While ISUP GG 1 is mentioned as a possibility, it's described as uncertain and the focus is deemed too small for proper grading.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
