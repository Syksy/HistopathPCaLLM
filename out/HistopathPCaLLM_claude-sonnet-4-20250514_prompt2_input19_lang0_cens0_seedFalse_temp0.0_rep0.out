Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "targeted prostate biopsies"
2. **Malignancy**: Sample 4 contains "adenocarcinoma" 
3. **Gleason grade**: The adenocarcinoma shows "Gleason 3, approx 90%" as the major component and "Gleason 4, 10%" as the minor component

Following the instruction to report only the most severe lesion, I'm focusing on sample 4 which contains the malignant findings.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
