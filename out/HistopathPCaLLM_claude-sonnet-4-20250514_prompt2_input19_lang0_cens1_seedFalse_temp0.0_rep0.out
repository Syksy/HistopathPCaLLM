Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but doesn't explicitly specify whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of "samples were divided into 4 batches" suggests multiple samples but the specific procedure type is not clearly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes samples 2 and 3 as "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it mentions "cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue" and notes it's "uncertain whether... this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)." However, this is described as uncertain and requires further verification, so no definitive malignancy is established.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned anywhere in the statement, which is consistent with the uncertain/inconclusive nature of the findings.

Since the sample type is not clearly specified, malignancy is uncertain/not confirmed, and no Gleason grade is provided, this appears to be an inconclusive or preliminary report.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
