Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. Sample type: "12 representative needle biopsies" clearly indicates this is a biopsy procedure
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly concludes "only benign-like growth is observed" with no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported, no Gleason grading would be applicable

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
