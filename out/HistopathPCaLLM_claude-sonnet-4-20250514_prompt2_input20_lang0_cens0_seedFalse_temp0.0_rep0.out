Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "prostatectomy resection" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. **Malignancy**: "adenocarcinoma" is clearly mentioned in both apex and basis locations
3. **Gleason grade**: Two different grades are reported - Gleason 3+4 at the apex and 4+4 at the basis. Since the instruction asks for the most severe lesion, I should report the higher grade of 4+4=8

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
