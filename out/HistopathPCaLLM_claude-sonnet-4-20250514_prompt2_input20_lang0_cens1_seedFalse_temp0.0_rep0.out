Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" but doesn't specify if they're from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of "apex, middle, and basis region" could suggest systematic sampling, but it's not definitively stated.

2. Malignancy: The text states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region" and that the samples "have been highly affected." No definitive malignancy is reported.

3. Gleason grade: While "3+4" is mentioned hypothetically ("Even in the hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found"), this is not a reported finding but rather a theoretical example. No actual Gleason grade is reported.

Since the examination was inconclusive due to treatment effects and no definitive findings are reported, this falls into the "NA" category for the key diagnostic elements.

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA", 
"Gleason": "NA"
}
