Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" but doesn't specify if they're from biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. The mention of "apex, middle, and basis region" and the suggestion to "re-sample" suggests these are tissue samples, but the specific procedure type is not clearly stated.

2. Malignancy: The text states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region" and that the tissue samples "have been highly affected." This indicates no definitive malignant findings could be determined.

3. Gleason grade: While there's a hypothetical mention of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)," this is presented as a theoretical scenario, not an actual finding. No actual Gleason grade is reported.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
