Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "poorly differentiated growth," enlarged nuclei with visible nucleoli, and "tumor-like tissue" - these are clear indicators of malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4," which would be reported as 5+4=9 for the most severe lesion
