Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "extracted prostate material" but doesn't specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: While the statement describes tissue examination findings like "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth," it explicitly states that "nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment" and that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material." The pathologist indicates they cannot make a proper assessment and need to conduct additional quality control before revisiting the material.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided, as no definitive malignancy assessment could be made due to technical issues.

Since the specimen quality is too poor for diagnostic assessment and requires additional quality control before a proper evaluation can be made, this represents an inconclusive/inadequate specimen rather than a valid diagnostic statement.
