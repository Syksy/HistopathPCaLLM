Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies" which indicates this is a biopsy sample.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth" on the left side, indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4" for the left side fragments. Since this represents the most severe lesion found and follows the typical Gleason grading pattern, this would be structured as 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
