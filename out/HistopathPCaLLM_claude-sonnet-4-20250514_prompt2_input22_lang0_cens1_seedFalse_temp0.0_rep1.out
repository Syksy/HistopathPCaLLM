Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragments from left and right sides, which indicates this is a biopsy sample.

2. Malignancy: The pathologist explicitly states that "the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to technical issues with the sample quality and concerns about contamination.

3. Gleason grade: The statement mentions that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and no specific Gleason score is provided due to the sample quality issues.

Since the pathologist cannot make a definitive assessment of malignancy due to sample quality issues, this should be classified as "NA" for malignancy and Gleason grade.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
