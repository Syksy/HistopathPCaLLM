Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: "adenocarcinoma" is clearly stated, indicating malignant tumor findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "mainly differentiation stage 4 (60%)" and "second most common stage 5 (approx 30%)", with a conclusion of "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." This corresponds to Gleason 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
