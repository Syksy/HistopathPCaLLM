Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "turp-chippings" which indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates malignant findings with "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma."

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." While it doesn't explicitly state the full Gleason pattern (e.g., 4+4=8), it clearly indicates a Gleason sum of 8.

}
