Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings" but this appears to be describing a teaching exercise with multiple sample types rather than reporting on a specific clinical case.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes teaching material that was initially benign, with some cases upgraded to low-grade malignancy (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4), but explicitly states this was a teaching exercise, not a clinical report.

3. **Gleason grade**: While Gleason scores are mentioned (3+3, 3+4, Gleason 6), these are described in the context of a teaching exercise rather than reporting actual clinical findings.

This statement is describing a pathology training exercise rather than providing a clinical histopathological report on a specific patient case. Therefore, it does not constitute a valid clinical histopathological statement for the purposes of this data extraction task.
