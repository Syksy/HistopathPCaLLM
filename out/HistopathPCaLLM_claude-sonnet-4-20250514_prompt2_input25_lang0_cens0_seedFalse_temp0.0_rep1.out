Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "tissue cylinders" with specific measurements (8+6mm, 10mm, 5+5mm), which is characteristic terminology for biopsy cores.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly concludes with "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma" and describes tumor growth in samples (1) and (2).

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement describes Gleason patterns 3 and 4 in both samples (1) and (2). For the most severe lesion, I need to determine the primary and secondary patterns:
   - Sample (1): Gleason 3 pattern ~30%, Gleason 4 pattern 20%
   - Sample (2): Gleason 3 pattern <35%, Gleason 4 pattern ~15%
   
   In both samples, pattern 3 is more prevalent than pattern 4, making the most severe grade 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
