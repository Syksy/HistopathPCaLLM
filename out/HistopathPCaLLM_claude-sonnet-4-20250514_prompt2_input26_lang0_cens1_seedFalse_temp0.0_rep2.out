Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "material originates from the prostate" with samples marked with indices, and discusses assessing "spread through the capsule" which suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: While clinical notes mention a possible "Gleason sum 7", the pathologist states the material is "very difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy" and that "it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified." The histopathology cannot definitively confirm malignancy due to radiation effects.

3. **Gleason grade**: Although "Gleason sum 7" is mentioned, the pathologist explicitly states uncertainty about whether this was verified and notes the material cannot be reasonably assessed due to radiation therapy effects.

  "Gleason": "NA"
