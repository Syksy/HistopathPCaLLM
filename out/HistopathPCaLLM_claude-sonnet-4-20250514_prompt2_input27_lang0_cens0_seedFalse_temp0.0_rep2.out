Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: "shavings" indicates tissue shavings, which is characteristic of TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedures
2. Malignancy: "Carcinoma was histologically detected" clearly indicates malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: "Gleason 3+3=6" is explicitly stated

```json
{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
