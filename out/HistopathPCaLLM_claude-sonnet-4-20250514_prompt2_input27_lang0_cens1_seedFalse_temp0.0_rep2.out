Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" that was processed, but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. Malignancy: The statement is ambiguous about malignant findings. It mentions "growth patterns" that "did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation" and only "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities" - this is very uncertain language.

3. Gleason grade: Only mentions "debatably Gleason score 3" with uncertainty, but doesn't provide the standard major+minor format.

Given the uncertain and unclear nature of this statement, particularly the ambiguous language around potential malignancy and Gleason scoring, this appears to be an invalid or inconclusive histopathological statement.
