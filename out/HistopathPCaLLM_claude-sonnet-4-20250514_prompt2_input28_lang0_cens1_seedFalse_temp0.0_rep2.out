Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "six different sites of interest" that were "inspected" and refers to "regions of interest" (RoIs). This language is consistent with a biopsy procedure where multiple sites are sampled.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "possible pre-malignant changes," and findings that "warrant further inspection," but does not definitively diagnose malignancy/adenocarcinoma. The language suggests suspicious findings requiring further evaluation rather than confirmed malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement, which is consistent with the absence of a definitive malignancy diagnosis.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
