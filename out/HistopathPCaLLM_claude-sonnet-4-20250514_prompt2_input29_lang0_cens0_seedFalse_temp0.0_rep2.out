Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" with systematic sampling from different planes and lobes, which indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes "invasive adenocarcinoma" with capsular penetration and perineural invasion, indicating malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" (which appears to be a transcription error, likely meaning grade 3), and concludes with "Score sum 7". This suggests a Gleason score of 4+3=7.
