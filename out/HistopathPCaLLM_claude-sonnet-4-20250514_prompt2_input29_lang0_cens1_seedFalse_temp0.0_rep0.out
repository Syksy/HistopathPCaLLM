Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and describes systematic sampling (A-F samples from different anatomical locations), which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: While there are references to "tumor cells," "differentiation stages," and "poor differentiation," the statement explicitly says these cannot be assessed due to contaminated samples. The summary indicates "Score sum determination was not possible" and samples need re-examination, meaning no definitive malignancy determination was made.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly states "Score sum determination was not possible" due to the sampling issues.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
