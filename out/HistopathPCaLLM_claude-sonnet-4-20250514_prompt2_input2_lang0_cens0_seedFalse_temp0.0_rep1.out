Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: The text clearly states "fresh prostatectomy specimen" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic examination shows "normal benign growth" and explicitly states no tumor growth was found in any examined areas. The summary confirms only "low inflammatory state" and "normal aging" changes.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor was found (only benign tissue), no Gleason grading would be applicable.
