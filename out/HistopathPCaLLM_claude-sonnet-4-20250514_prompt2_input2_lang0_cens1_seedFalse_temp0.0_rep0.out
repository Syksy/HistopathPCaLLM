Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen" - this doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), so this would be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "Further findings cannot be reliable inferred" and mentions they "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma" - this suggests no definitive malignant findings were identified, only potential/inconclusive findings. The answer would be "no" for confirmed malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in the statement, and since there are no confirmed malignant findings, this would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
