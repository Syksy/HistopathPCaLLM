Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells" - "chippings" indicates TURP (transurethral resection of prostate)

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" and discusses Gleason grading, indicating malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5" and references "Grade Group 3 after revision". For Gleason scoring, the primary (most common) pattern comes first, so this would be 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
