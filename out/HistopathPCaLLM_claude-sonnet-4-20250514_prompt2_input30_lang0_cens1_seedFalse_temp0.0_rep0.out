Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" and discusses consultation about findings, but does not specify whether this was from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement mentions "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but explicitly states that the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions" and that "the earlier uncertain diagnosis...could therefore not be determined."

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in this consultation note.

Since this appears to be a consultation note about inconclusive/uncertain findings rather than a definitive histopathological diagnosis, and lacks the specific diagnostic information requested:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
