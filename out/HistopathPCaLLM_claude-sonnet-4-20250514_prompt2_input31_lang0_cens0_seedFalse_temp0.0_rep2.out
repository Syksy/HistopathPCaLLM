Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies" - this is clearly a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes Gleason grading (3+3=6 initially, then pattern 4 and 5), which only applies to malignant adenocarcinoma. The text also mentions "aggressive tumor characteristics."

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple grades are mentioned:
   - Initial: Gleason 3+3=6
   - Most recent/severe: "primary differentiation pattern 4" and "second most common differentiation pattern is 5"
   
Since I need to report the most severe lesion, this would be 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
