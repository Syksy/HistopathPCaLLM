Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "samples were taken" but does not specify whether these were biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP samples.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement mentions "suspicious findings" twice, but does not definitively state the presence of malignant tumor/adenocarcinoma. The findings are described as suspicious and difficult to interpret, requiring additional samples.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned anywhere in the statement.

Since this appears to be an inconclusive diagnostic report without definitive findings or specific sample type identification, and lacks the key elements needed for structured data extraction:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
