Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "radical prostatectomy" - this corresponds to "RP" in the allowed values.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" with various Gleason patterns, indicating malignant tumor findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: Multiple Gleason patterns are mentioned (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3). Following the instruction to report only the most severe lesion, the highest grade is 4+4=8.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
