Looking at this statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't clearly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure. While it mentions "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles" which might suggest surgical resection, this is not definitively stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear" but doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in the prostate tissue itself. The phrase "clear" typically means no malignancy in those specific structures, but no definitive statement is made about the prostate tissue.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason score or grading information is provided in this statement.

Since this statement lacks clear, definitive information about the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grading, I must classify this as insufficient information.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
