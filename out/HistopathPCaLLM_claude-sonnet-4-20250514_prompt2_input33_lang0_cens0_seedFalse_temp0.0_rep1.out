Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Radical prostatectomy preparate" clearly indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes tumor findings, capsular penetration, and lymph node involvement, clearly indicating malignant findings are present

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3" - since I need to report the most severe lesion and 4+3=7 is more severe than 3+4=7, I'll report the higher grade pattern

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
