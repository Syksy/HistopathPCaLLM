Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the text:
- No clear indication of sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is mentioned
- The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and mentions "possibly abnormal findings" but no definitive malignancy is reported
- No Gleason grade is mentioned anywhere in the text

Since there are no malignant findings reported, no Gleason grade would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
