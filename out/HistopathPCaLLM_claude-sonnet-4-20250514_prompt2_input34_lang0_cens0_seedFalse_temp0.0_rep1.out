Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "resection weighing 7.5gr" - this indicates a surgical resection specimen, which corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy)

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities" - this clearly indicates no malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found (benign findings only), no Gleason grading would be applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
