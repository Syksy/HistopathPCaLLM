Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr" but does not explicitly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and notes that "Findings do not indicate prostatic [malignancy]" - this suggests benign findings rather than malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, which is consistent with benign findings.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
