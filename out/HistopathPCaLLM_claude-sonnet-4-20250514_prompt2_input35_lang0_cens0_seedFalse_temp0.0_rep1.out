Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate biopsies from left and right lobe"
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No signs of carcinoma" and only describes benign findings (PIN changes and hyperplasia)
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no carcinoma was found, no Gleason grading would be applicable

```json
{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
