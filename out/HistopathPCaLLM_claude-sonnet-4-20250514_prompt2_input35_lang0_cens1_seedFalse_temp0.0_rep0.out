Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe" but doesn't explicitly specify the sampling method (biopsy, RP, TURP). Without clear indication of the procedure type, this would be "NA".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "high-grade PIN-changes" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and "hyperplasia," but no adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor is mentioned. PIN and hyperplasia are not malignant findings, so this would be "no".

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignant tumor is reported, only benign/pre-malignant conditions (PIN and hyperplasia), there would be no Gleason grading, so this would be "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
