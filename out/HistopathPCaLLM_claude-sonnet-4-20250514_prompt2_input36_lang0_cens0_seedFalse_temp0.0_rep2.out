Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "The preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" which describes a whole prostate specimen with significant weight and dimensions, consistent with a radical prostatectomy (RP). The mention of multiple cassettes for processing also supports this being a surgical specimen.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly states "No signs of malignity" and describes only "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia," which are benign findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, there would be no Gleason grading applicable.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
