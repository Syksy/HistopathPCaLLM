Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample size and weight is normal" and describes macro and regular cassettes being prepared, but does not explicitly specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but does not mention any malignant findings like adenocarcinoma or cancer.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in this statement.

The findings suggest benign hyperplastic changes rather than malignancy, but the sample type cannot be determined from the given information.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
