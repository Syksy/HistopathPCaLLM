Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: "electrosection chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The findings describe "hyperplasia" (benign enlargement) with no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant cells
3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with hyperplasia only, no Gleason grading applies

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
