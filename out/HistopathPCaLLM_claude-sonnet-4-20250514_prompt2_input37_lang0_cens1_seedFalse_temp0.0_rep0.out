Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but does not specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The examination describes "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation" but makes no mention of adenocarcinoma, malignancy, or cancer. The statement also indicates that "further examination was not possible at this time" and samples will be "examined further next week," suggesting an incomplete analysis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned in this statement.

Since this appears to be an incomplete examination with no definitive findings regarding malignancy reported, the appropriate structured response is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
