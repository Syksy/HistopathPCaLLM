Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. Sample type: "Representative needle biopsies" clearly indicates this is a biopsy procedure
2. Malignancy: The statement explicitly says "No suspected malignity" 
3. Gleason grade: Since no malignancy was found, only benign findings (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation), no Gleason grading applies

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
