Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" but does not specify whether these are from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement only describes "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" - these are benign findings. No malignant tumor or adenocarcinoma is mentioned.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported, there would be no Gleason grading provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
