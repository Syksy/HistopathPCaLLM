Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy specimen
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "a tumor with 3 foci" and mentions Gleason grading, clearly indicating malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement specifies "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages" with "Gleason grade is 7"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
