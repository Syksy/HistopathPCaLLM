Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample under examination" but does not specify whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. No clear indication is given.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings," indicating uncertainty about the presence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement clearly states "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point," indicating no Gleason grade can be determined.

Since the sample type is not specified, malignancy status is uncertain, and Gleason score cannot be assessed, all fields should be marked as "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
