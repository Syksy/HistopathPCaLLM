Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: "prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Nothing indicating malignancy is found"
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, this would be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
