Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" obtained "in a single run" with "burn artefacts" preventing detailed examination. This description is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure, which typically yields larger amounts of tissue and can have cautery/burn artifacts.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run" due to burn artifacts preventing detailed examination. No malignancy is identified or reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is reported and the examination was inconclusive, no Gleason grading is provided.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
