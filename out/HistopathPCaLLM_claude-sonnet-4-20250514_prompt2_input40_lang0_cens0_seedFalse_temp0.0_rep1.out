Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. The mention of "shaving material" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. The findings show "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth"
3. The summary confirms "Benign prostate hyperplasia"

Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy detected, there would be no Gleason grading reported.
