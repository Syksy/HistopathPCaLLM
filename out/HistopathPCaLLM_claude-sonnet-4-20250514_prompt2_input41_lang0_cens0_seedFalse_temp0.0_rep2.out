Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe" - this clearly indicates biopsy samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material" - this indicates no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no prostate cancer was found (benign findings), there would be no Gleason grading reported.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
