Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate" but doesn't specify the collection method (biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy: The statement describes benign findings (chronic inflammation, atrophied glands) and explicitly states it's "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not" - indicating no definitive malignant findings
3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned, which is consistent with no malignant findings

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
