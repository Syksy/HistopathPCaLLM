Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "Prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is from a radical prostatectomy (RP)
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of Gleason grades and adenocarcinoma differentiation indicates malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: Explicitly stated as "score 7 (4+3)" with predominantly grade 4 and small amount of grade 3

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
