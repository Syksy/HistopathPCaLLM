Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze each component:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate sample weighing app 8?" - this appears to be describing a prostate specimen by weight, which suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined" - this indicates no definitive malignant findings were identified.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was definitively identified, no Gleason grading would be provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
