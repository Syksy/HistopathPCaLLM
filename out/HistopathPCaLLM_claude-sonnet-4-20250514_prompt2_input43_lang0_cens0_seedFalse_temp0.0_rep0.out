Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: "prostate chippings" indicates this is from a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material" - indicating no malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no adenocarcinoma was found (benign statement), this should be "NA"

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
