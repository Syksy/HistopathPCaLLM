Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "30g prostate samples" which indicates a substantial amount of tissue. This weight is consistent with TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens, which typically involve removing larger amounts of prostate tissue.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" and describes "mostly ordinary prostate tissue" with only "isolated atrophied glands visible." This indicates no malignant findings were identified.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
