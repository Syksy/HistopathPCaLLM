Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine" - this clearly indicates "biopsy"

2. Malignancy: The statement describes "Normally structured prostate tissue", "Little chronic inflammation", "Nothing suspicious", and concludes "now no tumor tissue can be seen" - this indicates no current malignant findings, so "no"

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignant tumor is found in the current sample, this would be "NA"

```json
{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "no", 
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
