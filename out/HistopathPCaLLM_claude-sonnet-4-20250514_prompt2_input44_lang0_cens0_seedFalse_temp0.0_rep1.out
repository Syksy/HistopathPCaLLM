Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine" - this clearly indicates a biopsy procedure.

2. Malignancy: The statement describes "Normally structured prostate tissue," "Little chronic inflammation," "Nothing suspicious," and concludes with "now no tumor tissue can be seen." This indicates no current malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignant tumor is present in the current sample, no Gleason grading is applicable.
