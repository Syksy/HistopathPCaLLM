Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" but doesn't explicitly specify if this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "Normally structured prostate tissue" with "chronic inflammation" and "atrophy" but explicitly states "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates no current malignant findings in this particular sample.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided since no malignancy was identified in this sample.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
