Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: "whole prostatectomy preparate" indicates this is a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "tumor tissue focus" and Gleason grading indicates malignant findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "classes 3+4" referring to gland structures, and separately mentions "tissue gleason 3". The "classes 3+4" appears to be describing the Gleason pattern, making this a 3+4=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
