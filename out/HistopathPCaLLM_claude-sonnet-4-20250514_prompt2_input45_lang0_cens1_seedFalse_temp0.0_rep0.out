Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample" but doesn't clearly specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. However, the mention of "seminal vesicles," "marginals," "capsel," and "lymph nodes" suggests this is from a radical prostatectomy specimen, as these structures are typically evaluated in RP specimens rather than biopsies.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "suspect" sample with "unclear structure" that is "not able to detect" and requires "further inspection." There is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy stated - only suspicious findings that need additional evaluation.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in this statement, as there is no confirmed malignancy diagnosis.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
