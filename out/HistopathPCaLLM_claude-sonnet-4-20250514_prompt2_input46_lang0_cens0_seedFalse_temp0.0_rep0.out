Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: "Shaved prostate chippings" indicates this is material from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of Prostate) procedure
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material"
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading would be applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
