Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate material" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not" - indicating no definitive malignant findings were identified.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, and since no malignancy was definitively identified, no Gleason score would be applicable.

The findings describe benign features (regular prostate tissue with glands, possible basal cell hyperplasia) with uncertainty about malignancy rather than confirmed cancer.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
