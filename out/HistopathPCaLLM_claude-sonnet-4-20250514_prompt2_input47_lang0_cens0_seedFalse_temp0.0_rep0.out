Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left" - this indicates biopsy samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malign findings on the left or the right" - this clearly indicates no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, no Gleason grading would be applicable or reported.

Note: The "3+4=7" mentioned in the text refers to the total length of biopsies in centimeters, not Gleason grading.
