Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analyzing the statement:
- Sample type: The text mentions "Examined sample material" from prostate tissue with specific measurements, but doesn't explicitly state the sampling method (biopsy, RP, TURP)
- Malignancy: The statement clearly says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right" - indicating inconclusive results for malignancy
- Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned, only findings of normal epithelium and chronic inflammation

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
