Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" which indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP)

2. **Malignancy**: The text clearly states "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" indicating malignant tumor findings

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement describes two tumor foci:
   - First focus: Gleason 4 (most common) + 3 (next common) = 4+3=7
   - Second focus: Gleason 5 (>80%) + 4 (small portion) = 5+4=9
   
   The summary confirms "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection" and since I need to report the most severe lesion, this would be the Gleason 9 (5+4=9).

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
