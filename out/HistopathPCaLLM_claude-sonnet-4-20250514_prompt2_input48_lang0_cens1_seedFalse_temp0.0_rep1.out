Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies" - this indicates autopsy material, which doesn't match any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP").

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "histological changes" and "interesting findings" but explicitly states this material is for educational purposes and cannot be used to derive differentiation scores. There's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly says "this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)" and mentions it's for educational demonstration purposes only.

Since this appears to be autopsy material used for educational purposes rather than a diagnostic histopathological report, and the sample type doesn't match the allowed categories, this should be classified as not providing the required structured information.

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA", 
"Gleason": "NA"
}
