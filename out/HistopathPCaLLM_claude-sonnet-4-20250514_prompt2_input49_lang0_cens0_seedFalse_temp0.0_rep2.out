Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which are characteristic terms used for TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "5 shavings contained carcinoma," confirming the presence of malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." Following standard Gleason scoring convention where the most common (primary) pattern is listed first, this would be reported as 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
