Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.

Analysis:
- The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" but doesn't specify if these are from biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP
- There are "some changes that warrant further investigation" but no definitive malignant findings are reported
- No Gleason grading is mentioned
- The assessment is incomplete due to "technical limitations"

Since the statement doesn't provide definitive information for any of the three required fields, this appears to be an inconclusive or incomplete pathology report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA", 
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
