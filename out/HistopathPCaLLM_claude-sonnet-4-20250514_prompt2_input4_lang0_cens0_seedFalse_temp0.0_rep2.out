Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations"
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" and describes the tissue as "benign"
3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy is present, no Gleason grading is applicable

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
