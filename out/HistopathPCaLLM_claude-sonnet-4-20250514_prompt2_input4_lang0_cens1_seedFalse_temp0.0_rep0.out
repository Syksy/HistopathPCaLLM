Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample part" and "sampled tissue," which indicates this is a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "no notable atypic patterns are present" and notes that while the sample is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma," no malignancy is actually detected or reported in the available tissue.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no adenocarcinoma is found, no Gleason grading is provided.
