Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "radical prostatectomy" at the beginning
2. **Malignancy**: The text states "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed" indicating malignant findings
3. **Gleason grade**: Two different Gleason scores are mentioned:
   - Macro A: "growth pattern 4+3" 
   - Macro B: "higher sum (9)" with "architecture 4+5"

Since the instructions specify to report only the most severe lesion, and Macro B has the higher Gleason sum of 9 (4+5=9), this should be reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
