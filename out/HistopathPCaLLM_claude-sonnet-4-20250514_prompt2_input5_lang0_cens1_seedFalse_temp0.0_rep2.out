Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate" and describes detailed sampling and processing methods with dye marking and sectioning, which is characteristic of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" and refers to "suspected higher sum one" being sent for further inspection. However, no definitive malignancy is confirmed in this report - it appears to be describing areas of concern that require additional evaluation.

3. **Gleason grade**: No specific Gleason grades or sum are provided, as the pathologist states they "could not be inferred" and the case is being referred for further inspection.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
