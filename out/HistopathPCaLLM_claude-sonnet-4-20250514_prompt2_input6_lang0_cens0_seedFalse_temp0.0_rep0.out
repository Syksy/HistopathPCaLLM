Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify the following key information:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" which indicates this is from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and concludes with "benign prostate hyperplasia," indicating no malignant findings.

3. **Gleason grade**: Since this is a benign finding with no malignancy reported, no Gleason grading is applicable.
