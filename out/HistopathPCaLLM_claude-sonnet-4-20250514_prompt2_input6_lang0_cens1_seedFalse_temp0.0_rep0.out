Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the three structured fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "original prostatic operation material" which indicates this is from a surgical procedure, most likely a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly says "The results are therefore inconclusive" due to technical challenges with burn artifacts, and no malignant findings are reported.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned, and since the results are inconclusive with no malignancy reported, this would be "NA".

```json
{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
