Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to extract information about the most severe lesion:

1. **Sample type**: The statement clearly mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies" - this indicates a biopsy procedure.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" but explicitly states that "the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet." This indicates suspicion but no definitive malignancy diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is provided in the statement, as this would typically only be assigned when there is a definitive diagnosis of malignancy.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
