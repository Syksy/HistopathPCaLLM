Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions "prostate sample material was routinely collected" but doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP.

2. Malignancy: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but explicitly states "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material" and that the rest showed normal expected structures. This indicates no definitive malignant findings.

3. Gleason grade: No Gleason grading is mentioned, which is consistent with no definitive malignant findings.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
