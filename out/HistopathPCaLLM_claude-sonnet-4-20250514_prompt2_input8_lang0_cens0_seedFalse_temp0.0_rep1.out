Looking at this histopathological statement, I can identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate" - this indicates a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly describes "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties" and provides Gleason grading, indicating malignant findings are present.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7" - this represents the most severe lesion as requested.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
