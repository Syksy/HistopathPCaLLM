Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and refers to "samples" with indices, suggesting this is from a prostate procedure, but doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason patterns" and "suspicion of PIN-changes" but explicitly states that samples "were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is a precancerous condition, not malignancy.

3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ?" and "no grade score is reported" - indicating no actual Gleason score was determined.

Since there are no confirmed malignant findings and no definitive sample type is specified, this appears to be a benign finding with incomplete/missing data.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
