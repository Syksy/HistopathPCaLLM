Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to identify:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which indicates a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed" and concludes with "benign hyperplasia."

3. **Gleason grade**: Since no malignancy was found and this is a benign case, no Gleason grading would be applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
