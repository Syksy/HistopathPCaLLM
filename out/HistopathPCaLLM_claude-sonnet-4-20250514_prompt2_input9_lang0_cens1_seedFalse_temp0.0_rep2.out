Looking at this histopathological statement, I need to analyze it for the three required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "sample material" and "prostate tissue" but does not specify whether this is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP procedure.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and mentions some disproportionate glandular structures attributed to "technical difficulties in processing." Importantly, it states "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn from currently examined material" and suspects "faulty processing." There is no mention of adenocarcinoma, malignancy, or cancer.

3. **Gleason grade**: No Gleason grading is mentioned anywhere in the statement.

Since this appears to be an inconclusive report due to processing issues rather than a definitive histopathological diagnosis, and lacks the specific diagnostic information typically found in valid histopathological statements:

```json
{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA", 
"Gleason": "NA"
}
```
