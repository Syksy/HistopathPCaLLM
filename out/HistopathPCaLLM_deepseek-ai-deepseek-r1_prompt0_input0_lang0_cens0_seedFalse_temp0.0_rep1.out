Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the standard terms. Biopsy usually involves taking small tissue samples, RP is surgical removal, and TURP is a procedure to remove tissue for BPH. Since the report mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia," which is often diagnosed via TURP, but the sample type here is described as chipping. However, "chipping" isn't one of the allowed values. The user might have meant TURP, but since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the answer should be NA here. But I need to check if "chipping" is a term associated with any of the allowed types. Alternatively, maybe the sample is a biopsy. Wait, the report says "benign prostate tissue" and mentions "suspected benign prostate hyperplasia." TURP is a common procedure for BPH. However, the sample type is "chipping," which I'm not sure about. Since the allowed values don't include chipping, I'll have to go with NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement clearly says "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So the answer here is "no."

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report is benign, Gleason grade should be NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Also, the user specified to only take the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all answers are straightforward.
