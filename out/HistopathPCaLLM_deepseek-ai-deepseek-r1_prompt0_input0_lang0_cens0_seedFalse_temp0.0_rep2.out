Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. The examples given don't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So the answer should be "no" because there are no malignancies mentioned.

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the sample is benign, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: no match, so NA. Malignant: definitely no. Gleason: NA. That seems right.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
