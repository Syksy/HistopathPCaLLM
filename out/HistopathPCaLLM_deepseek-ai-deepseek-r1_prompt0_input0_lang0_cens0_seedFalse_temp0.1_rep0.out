Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to convert the free-text statement into a JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states, "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." The explicit mention of no malignancies or carcinoma means the answer here is "no".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report confirms no malignancies, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. So that's "NA".

Now, I need to structure these answers into a JSON without any nested structures. The user specified that only the most severe lesion's results should be used, but in this case, there are no malignant findings, so all answers are straightforward. Let me double-check each part to ensure I didn't miss any details. The sample type isn't specified as any of the allowed terms, malignancy is explicitly denied, and Gleason isn't needed here. Everything seems to fit. Time to put it all together in valid JSON.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
