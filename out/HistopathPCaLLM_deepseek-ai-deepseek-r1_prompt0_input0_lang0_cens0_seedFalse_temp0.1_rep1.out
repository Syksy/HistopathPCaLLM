Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed categories. The report mentions "benign prostate tissue" but doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So the answer should be "no."

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report says there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable here. So that's NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since everything here is benign, there's no conflicting information. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting. Let me double-check the allowed values and the text again to confirm. Yep, all looks good. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
