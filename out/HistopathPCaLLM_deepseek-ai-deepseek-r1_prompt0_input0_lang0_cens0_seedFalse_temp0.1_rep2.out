Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. The examples given don't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So the answer should be "no" since there are no malignancies mentioned.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The Gleason score is typically reported for malignant cases. Since this case is benign, there's no Gleason grade provided. So the answer here is NA.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all answers should reflect that. Let me double-check each part again to confirm.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
