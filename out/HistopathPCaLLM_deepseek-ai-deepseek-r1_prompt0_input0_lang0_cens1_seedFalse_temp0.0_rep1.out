Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "sample material was obtained" but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't there. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't mentioned.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they can't determine malignancy. But the question is about presence, not certainty. However, since they can't confirm, maybe the answer is no? Wait, but the statement says "cannot be conducted," which might mean it's inconclusive. But the allowed values don't have an inconclusive option. The user instructions say to use NA if the information isn't available. Since the exam couldn't determine malignancy, maybe NA is appropriate here. But the user's third question mentions using NA for benign in Gleason grade. Hmm. Let me check again. The statement says "any inference of malignancy... cannot be conducted." So the presence of malignant findings isn't confirmed, so maybe the answer is "no"? Or is it NA because it's not determined? The user's allowed values are yes, no, NA. Since the test couldn't conclude, maybe NA is correct here. But I need to be careful. The question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the examination couldn't determine, then the answer isn't yes or no, so NA makes sense.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy couldn't be determined and there's no mention of Gleason grading, the answer here is definitely NA.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: NA (since the test couldn't determine)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no malignancy found or determined)
