Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination", but it doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since there's no explicit mention, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. However, the next part mentions "some spot-like inflammation" and that reliable conclusions can't be drawn regarding benign prostate hyperplasia. Since malignancy can't be inferred, but there's no positive identification of malignant tumors, the answer here is "no" because the absence of confirmed malignancy would default to "no" unless stated otherwise. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says they can't conduct the inference, so maybe it's "NA"? Hmm, the user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if they can't determine, maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the user also says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". Since there's no mention of any malignant findings, perhaps "no" is correct. But the statement says they can't conclude, so maybe "NA" is better. I need to check the exact wording. The user says "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the report can't determine, then it's not a 'yes' or 'no', so "NA" might be right. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read the statement. The key part is "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they can't assess it, which would mean the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, but also not ruled out. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the information isn't available to make a determination.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the statement doesn't mention any Gleason grading (as there's no malignancy confirmed), the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe malignant is "no". Let me double-check. The user instructions say for the Gleason grade, use "NA" for benign statements. If malignant is "no", then Gleason is "NA". But if malignant is "NA", then Gleason is also "NA". The statement says they can't infer malignancy, so it's not confirmed as benign or malignant. Therefore, malignant tumor findings should be "NA", and Gleason grade is "NA". 

So the final structured data would be:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA
3. Gleason grade: NA
