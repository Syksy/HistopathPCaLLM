Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination", but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no explicit mention, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. Also, it mentions "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia." So, there's no confirmation of malignancy, but it's not explicitly stated as benign. However, since malignancy can't be inferred, the answer here should be "no" because there's no positive evidence of malignancy. Wait, but the allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, maybe "NA" is more appropriate. Hmm. Let me check again. The statement says "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted." So they can't determine it, which might mean the answer is "NA". But the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If they can't determine, then maybe it's "NA". However, the user instructions say to return "NA" only if the information isn't available. Wait, the options are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report explicitly states that malignancy can't be inferred, does that mean "no" because there's no evidence, or "NA" because it's inconclusive? The user might consider "no" as absence of malignancy, but if the test is inconclusive, maybe "NA" is better. But the example given in the problem might help. Let me think. The statement says "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia." So they can't confirm benign either. But for the malignant question, since they can't infer malignancy, maybe the answer is "no" because there's no positive finding. Alternatively, if the test is inconclusive, maybe "NA". This is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, I think "no" is safer here because there's no mention of malignancy found. Wait, but the user's instruction says "malignant tumor findings" – if they can't determine, then it's not a "yes", but "no" would imply no malignancy found. However, in medical terms, inconclusive might be different. But according to the allowed values, "NA" is allowed. Let me check the exact wording again. The statement says "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted." So they can't assess it. Therefore, the presence or absence isn't determined, so "NA" would be appropriate here. So the answer for malignant findings is "NA".

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason score is only applicable for malignant cases, the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the sample type: the user might expect "biopsy" if it's a sample obtained via biopsy. But the text says "sample material was obtained" but doesn't specify the method. So "NA" is correct. The answer should be:

1. "NA"
2. "NA"
3. "NA"

But wait, the second question: the user instruction says "malignant tumor findings" – if the report can't determine, is that "no" or "NA"? Let me think again. If the report states that malignancy cannot be inferred, does that mean there's no evidence of malignancy (hence "no") or that it's inconclusive (hence "NA")? The answer depends on the exact phrasing. The statement says "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted." So they can't make a determination. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, but absence isn't either. In such cases, "NA" would be appropriate because the information isn't available or can't be determined. So "NA" for question 2.

Yes, that makes sense. So the final structured data should be all "NA".
