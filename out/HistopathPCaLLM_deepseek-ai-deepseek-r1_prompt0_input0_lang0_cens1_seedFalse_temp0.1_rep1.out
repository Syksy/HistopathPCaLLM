Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination", but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no explicit mention, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text states, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This means they couldn't determine malignancy. However, the user wants the result from the most severe lesion. Since the text says they can't conclude malignancy and mentions inflammation but no clear malignancy, the answer here is "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy found. Wait, but the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." The text doesn't mention any lesions, just that conclusions can't be drawn. Hmm. Maybe "NA" is safer here. Wait, the instruction says if it's benign, use "no". The text says "any inference of malignancy cannot be conducted" but also mentions "findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia." So if it's benign, then malignant findings would be "no". But the text says "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn" about whether it's benign. This is a bit conflicting. The key part is "any inference of malignancy cannot be conducted." So they can't confirm malignancy, but they also can't confirm it's benign. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since they can't determine, maybe "NA" is appropriate. Wait, but the user says "malignant tumor findings" – if they can't determine, does that mean "NA"? Or if there's no mention of malignancy, maybe "no"? The text says "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted." So they can't assess it. Therefore, the answer should be "NA". Wait, but the user's allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the report can't determine, then "NA" would be correct here. But I need to check if there's any mention of malignancy. The text says they can't infer malignancy, so there's no positive finding. But does that mean "no" or "NA"? The user's instruction says "NA" is allowed. Since the examination couldn't be conducted, "NA" makes sense. But maybe the absence of malignancy findings would be "no". Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. If the report states that malignancy can't be assessed, then "NA" is appropriate. If it's explicitly stated that there's no malignancy, then "no". Here, it's the former case. So "NA" for malignant findings.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as numbers or "NA" for benign. Since the text doesn't mention any Gleason grading and the malignant findings are "NA" (or "no" if we decide that), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (since the type isn't specified)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (since assessment couldn't be done)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no malignancy reported)

Wait, but the text mentions "findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia." However, it says "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign..." So they can't confirm it's benign either. But the presence of inflammation might suggest benign, but not sure. However, the key point is that malignancy couldn't be assessed, so malignant findings are "NA". Therefore, the final structured data should be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
