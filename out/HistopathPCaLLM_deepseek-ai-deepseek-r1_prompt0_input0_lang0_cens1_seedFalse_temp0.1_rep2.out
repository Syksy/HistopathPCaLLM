Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination", but it doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So, the sample type isn't explicitly stated here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. Also, it mentions "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia." Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and the report is inconclusive, the answer here should be "no" because there's no positive identification of malignant tumors. Wait, but the options are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report can't conclude, maybe "NA" is more appropriate? Hmm. Let me check again. The statement says they can't infer malignancy, so there's no evidence of malignant findings. The question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they can't confirm, but also don't state any presence, maybe "no" is correct. Or is "NA" when the information isn't available? The key here is that the report explicitly states that malignancy can't be inferred, so there's no positive finding. Therefore, "no" might be the right choice. Wait, but "no" would mean that they checked and found no malignancy. However, the text says they can't conduct the inference, so maybe it's not possible to determine. In that case, "NA" might be better. But the allowed values for malignant findings are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, perhaps "NA" is the answer. But I need to be careful here. Let me re-read the text: "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they couldn't assess it. Therefore, the presence of malignancy isn't determined, so the answer should be "NA". Wait, but the third question about Gleason grade is "NA" for benign. If malignant is "NA", then Gleason would also be "NA". Let me confirm. The third field is Gleason grade, which is "NA" for benign. If malignant is "no", then Gleason is "NA". If malignant is "NA", then Gleason is "NA" as well. So in this case, since the report can't determine malignancy, the answer for malignant findings should be "NA". But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The user instruction says: "Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." But in this case, there's no mention of any lesions. The text mentions "some spot-like inflammation" but no lesions. So perhaps the malignant findings are "no" because there's no mention of malignancy, but the report says they can't infer it. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe "NA" is safer here because the assessment couldn't be conducted. So the answer for malignant findings is "NA".

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the report doesn't mention any Gleason grading and the malignant findings are either "no" or "NA", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: "NA" because the procedure isn't specified.
2. Malignant tumor findings: "NA" because the assessment couldn't be conducted.
3. Gleason grade: "NA" as there's no malignancy reported.

Wait, but the user instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". However, the text doesn't mention any lesions. It mentions inflammation but no lesions. So perhaps there's no severe lesion to consider. Therefore, the answers remain as above.
