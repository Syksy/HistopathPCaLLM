Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "höyläyslastuja" which translates to "chips" or "shavings" in English. TURP typically produces such chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This translates to benign prostate tissue without atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report confirms no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields. Let me double-check the terms to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is absent, so Gleason is NA. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
