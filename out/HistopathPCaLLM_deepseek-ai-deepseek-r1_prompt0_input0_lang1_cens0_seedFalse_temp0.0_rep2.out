Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings", which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This translates to benign prostate tissue without atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The answer seems straightforward here as there are no malignant findings. Let me double-check each part again to confirm. Sample type is TURP, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. All conditions are met. No issues spotted.
