Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go step by step.

1. **Sample type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical for TURP procedures. So the sample type here is TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." "Hyvänlaatuinen" means benign, and they specifically mention no malignancy or carcinoma. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

3. **Gleason grade**: The report mentions benign tissue with no malignancy. Since Gleason grading applies only to malignant cases, this should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any malignant lesions. The text confirms it's benign, so all three fields are clear. No nested structures, just straightforward answers.
