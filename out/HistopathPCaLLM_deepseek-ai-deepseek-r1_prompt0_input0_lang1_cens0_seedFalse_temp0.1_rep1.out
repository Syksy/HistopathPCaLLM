Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP. Biopsy would be a core needle biopsy, and RP is radical prostatectomy, which isn't mentioned. So the first answer is TURP.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta" which means benign prostate tissue. It also explicitly mentions no malignancy or carcinoma ("ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa"). So the answer here should be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings, the value should be "NA". The Gleason score is only applicable if there's cancer present. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grading because it's benign. So the third field is "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with the three keys and the specified allowed values. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm there's no mention of cancer. Yes, "hyvänlaatuinen" is benign, and they excluded malignancy. All set.
