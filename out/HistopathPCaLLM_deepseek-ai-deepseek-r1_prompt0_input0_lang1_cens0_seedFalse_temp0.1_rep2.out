Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "höyläyslastuja" which translates to "shavings" or "chips." TURP typically involves removing tissue chips, so this should be TURP. Biopsy would be a needle biopsy, and RP is the entire prostate. So the answer here is TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta" which means benign prostate tissue. It also mentions no malignancy or carcinoma. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the findings are benign, there's no cancer to report a Gleason score. So this should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any malignant lesions. The report clearly says no malignancy, so Gleason is NA. All three fields are covered correctly. No nested structures, just straightforward key-value pairs in JSON.

  "näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
