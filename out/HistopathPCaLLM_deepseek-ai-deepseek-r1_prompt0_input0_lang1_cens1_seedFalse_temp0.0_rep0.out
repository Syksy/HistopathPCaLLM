Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." There's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here, which means the answer should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to not being able to conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Additionally, it mentions "ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan," which suggests benign hyperplasia is suspected but not confirmed. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no).

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to the second question is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, without nested objects. Each key should directly have its value. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything. The key phrases about not being able to determine malignancy and the suspicion of benign hyperplasia reinforce that there's no malignancy reported. Therefore, the structured data should be as follows.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
