Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states: "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to that they can't conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Also, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan." So it's suspected to be benign hyperplasia but not confirmed. Since there's no evidence of malignancy, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no). Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says they can't determine malignancy, so maybe it's "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy, but the text is a bit ambiguous. However, the key point is whether malignant findings were present. Since they can't make a conclusion, but there's no positive identification of malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the uncertainty is such that it's not possible to determine, maybe "NA". Hmm. Let me think again. The question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If they can't determine, then the answer isn't clear. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report says they can't make a conclusion, perhaps the answer is "ei" because there's no positive finding. Or maybe "NA" because it's uncertain. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results and not to have nested structures. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "ei". But I need to be careful. The text says "ei voida tehdä" (cannot be made), which might mean that malignancy can't be ruled out, but there's no positive evidence. So in that case, the presence of malignancy would be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. So the second field is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

So putting it all together:
1. "NA" (sample type not specified)
2. "ei" (no malignant findings)
3. "NA" (no malignancy, so no Gleason)
