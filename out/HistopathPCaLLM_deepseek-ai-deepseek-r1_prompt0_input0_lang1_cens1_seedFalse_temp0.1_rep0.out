Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." There's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to not being able to conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Since there's no evidence of malignancy, the presence of malignant findings would be "ei" (no).

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So, the third field should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all related fields are NA. The JSON structure should follow the syntax without nested structures. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything. The key phrases are about not being able to make conclusions on malignancy, which confirms the absence of malignant findings. The sample type isn't mentioned, so NA is correct there. Gleason is only for malignant cases, so NA here as well.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
