Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as coming from "näytemateriaalia" which is Finnish for sample material. The report mentions "prostatakudosta" (prostate tissue) but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like TURP or biopsy aren't mentioned. Since there's no clear indication of the procedure type, the answer here should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä" which translates to they can't determine malignancy or carcinoma. Also, "ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä" means no conclusion can be drawn. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but it's not confirmed as benign either, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. The report says they can't make a determination about malignancy. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't determine, does that mean "ei" (no) or NA? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they can't conclude, then there's no confirmed malignancy, so "ei". But maybe the answer is NA here. Wait, the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report states that they can't make a conclusion about malignancy, maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, but the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). If there's no malignancy found, then "ei". But the text says they can't determine, which might mean it's inconclusive. However, in medical reports, if malignancy isn't confirmed, it's considered negative. Hmm. Let me check the exact wording again. The report says "ei voida tehdä" (cannot be made) regarding conclusions about malignancy. So there's no positive finding, hence "ei". So answer "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
