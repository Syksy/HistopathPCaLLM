Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures. Since it's a sample that's been processed in batches, but the exact type isn't specified, I think the safest answer here is NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states, "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to not being able to conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Additionally, it mentions "ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan," meaning they can't confirm if it's benign hyperplasia. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no), but wait—the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". However, the report doesn't confirm malignancy, so maybe "ei" is correct. But if the presence can't be determined, maybe NA? Hmm. The key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since they can't make a conclusion, does that mean there's no evidence, hence "ei"? Or is it uncertain, hence NA? The original instruction says for the second field: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report says they can't determine malignancy, then it's not confirmed, so "ei" might be appropriate. But maybe NA is better here because the presence isn't determinable. Wait, the options are "kyllä" if there are malignant findings, "ei" if there are none, and NA if unknown. Since the report states that they can't make a conclusion, maybe NA is the right choice here. But the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't find any malignancy, even if uncertain, maybe "ei". But the text says they can't draw conclusions about malignancy. So perhaps NA is better here. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check again. The report says "ei voida tehdä" (cannot be made) regarding malignancy. So there's no positive identification of malignancy, but also no confirmation of benign. So in this case, since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer should be "ei"? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user's instruction for the second field is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the report can't determine it, then the answer would be NA. Because "ei" would mean there are none, but if it's uncertain, NA is more accurate. So I think the correct answer here is NA.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed (second field is NA), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were some mention, but in this case, there's no Gleason score reported. So definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the user said "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion results should be returned). But in this case, there's no malignancy, so Gleason is NA. Let me confirm once more. The sample type: no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) but not the procedure type. So NA. Malignancy: can't be determined, so NA. Gleason: NA because no malignancy. That seems correct.
