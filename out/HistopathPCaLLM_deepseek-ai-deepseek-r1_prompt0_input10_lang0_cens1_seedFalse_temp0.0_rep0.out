Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't there. So the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "suspicious formations" and "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing," but there's no confirmation of malignancy. The conclusion doesn't state a malignant tumor was found, just that there were issues with the stainings. So the answer should be no, because there's no clear evidence of malignancy reported. Wait, but "suspicious" might imply possible malignancy. However, the user instructions say to use "yes" only if there's a confirmed finding. Since it's only a suspicion and not confirmed, the answer is no. Or maybe NA? Hmm. The key is whether the statement confirms malignancy. The conclusion doesn't confirm it; it's about the staining panel possibly failing. So malignant findings would be "no" because there's no positive identification. Alternatively, if the suspicious formations are considered possible but unconfirmed, maybe NA. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, and the suspicion is about the staining failing, not the presence of tumor, the answer is no. Wait, the statement says "suspicious formations that hinted at stainings failing were observed." So the suspicious formations are because the stainings might have failed, not necessarily because of malignancy. So the malignant tumor finding isn't confirmed. So answer is no.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is no, the Gleason grade is NA.

So the structured JSON would be:
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
