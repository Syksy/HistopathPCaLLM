Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "requested prostate samples" arriving in batches. The mention of "prostate tissue material" and the context of immunological stainings suggests these might be biopsy samples, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about samples arriving in batches due to a logistics error, but doesn't specify the procedure type. So, I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The conclusion mentions "suspicion of the staining immunopanel failing" in some samples. The text notes "suspicious formations" in earlier samples but says verification couldn't be established. There's no definitive mention of malignant cells or tumors. The presence of normal basal cells and inconclusive results due to possible staining issues mean there's no confirmation of malignancy. So, the answer here should be no, because there's no clear evidence of malignancy reported, just suspicion that couldn't be confirmed.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignant finding is no, the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were suspicious areas, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason scoring isn't applicable.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no confirmed lesion. So the final JSON should reflect that.

  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
