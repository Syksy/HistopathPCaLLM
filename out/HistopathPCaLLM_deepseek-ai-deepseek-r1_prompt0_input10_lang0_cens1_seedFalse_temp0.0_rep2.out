Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The conclusion talks about the staining immunopanel of prostate tissue, but the sample type isn't specified. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" but doesn't confirm malignancy. The conclusion states a suspicion of staining failure but doesn't diagnose malignancy. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignant tumor, the answer should be no. Wait, but "suspicious formations" might indicate possible malignancy. However, the user instructions say to consider only the most severe lesion. Since the conclusion doesn't confirm malignancy and the findings are inconclusive due to staining issues, the answer here is no. Or maybe NA? Hmm. The text says "suspicion" but no definitive diagnosis. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's not confirmed, maybe NA is better. Wait, the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the findings are inconclusive, then maybe NA. But the presence of suspicious formations might lean towards yes. But the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The conclusion says "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing in some samples" which might mean that the staining issues prevented a clear diagnosis. So the actual presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer is no. Or maybe NA? I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The text mentions "normal basal cells" which are a sign of benign tissue, but "suspicious formations" that hinted at stainings failing. The conclusion is about the staining panel possibly failing, but the actual tumor presence isn't confirmed. So since there's no definitive yes, and the answer can't be inferred, maybe NA. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't state malignancy, then it's no. But if it's uncertain, maybe NA. The user instruction says "malignant tumor findings" – if the findings are inconclusive, perhaps NA. But the presence of "suspicious formations" might be considered as possible malignancy, but the conclusion says the staining might have failed, so the results are not reliable. Therefore, the answer is NA. Wait, but the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." If the most severe is suspicious but not confirmed, then maybe NA. Alternatively, if the normal basal cells are present, that's benign, so malignant findings would be no. But the suspicious formations could be a conflicting point. However, since the conclusion doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer is no. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again. The presence of normal basal cells suggests benign, but suspicious formations might indicate possible malignancy. However, due to staining issues, it's inconclusive. Since the user wants the most severe lesion, and the conclusion doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer is no. Because the report doesn't state that malignancy was found, only suspicion due to possible staining failure. So malignant tumor findings would be no.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since there's no mention of Gleason grading in the text, and the malignant findings are no, the answer is NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA.
