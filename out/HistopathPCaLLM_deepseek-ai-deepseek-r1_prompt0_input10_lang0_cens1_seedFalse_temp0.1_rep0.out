Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but doesn't specify the type. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't there. The conclusion talks about "prostate tissue" samples but not the method. So maybe the sample type isn't mentioned, so I should put NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells" which are typically benign. There's a "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing" but no clear mention of malignancy. The suspicious formations might be due to staining issues, not necessarily cancer. Since there's no definitive malignant finding, the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, it's supposed to be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports using NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Let me double-check the text again to confirm there's no mention of sample type or malignancy. Yep, looks right. The answer should be straightforward.

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
