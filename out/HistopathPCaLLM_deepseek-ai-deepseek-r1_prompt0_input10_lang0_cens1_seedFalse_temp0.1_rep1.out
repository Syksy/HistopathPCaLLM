Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The conclusion talks about prostate tissue samples but doesn't clarify the method. So, I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't explicitly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" but doesn't confirm malignancy. The conclusion states a suspicion of staining failure but doesn't diagnose a malignant tumor. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, the answer here should be "no" because the findings are inconclusive, not confirming malignancy. Wait, but "suspicious formations" might imply possible malignancy. However, the user instructions say to report only the most severe lesion. The conclusion says suspicion but no verification. So maybe "no" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, if suspicious is considered as possible malignant, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's not confirmed, maybe "no" is safer. Or perhaps NA? Wait, the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the findings are suspicious but inconclusive, does that count as "no" or "NA"? The answer should be "no" if no malignancy was found, "yes" if found, and NA if not mentioned. Here, they mention suspicious but inconclusive due to staining issues. Since it's not confirmed, the answer is "no" because the presence isn't confirmed. Or maybe NA? Hmm. The key is whether the report states malignancy. The text says "suspicion" but doesn't confirm. So "no" because the answer is about findings, not suspicions. So "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade is NA.

So the structured data would be:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor: no
3. Gleason grade: NA

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and it's valid JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the most severe is benign, so Gleason is NA.

  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
