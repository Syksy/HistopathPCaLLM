Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but doesn't specify the type. Terms like "samples" are too vague. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP procedures. So I should put NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text talks about "suspicious formations" and "suspicion of the staining immunopanel failing," but there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. They observed normal basal cells and some inconclusive results from earlier samples. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignant tumors, the answer here should be no. Wait, but "suspicious formations" might imply possible malignancy. However, the conclusion states that the staining panel might have failed, so they can't confirm. So the answer is no because there's no confirmed malignancy. Or maybe NA? Hmm. The user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if it's not confirmed, maybe NA is better. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm presence or absence, NA might be appropriate. But the conclusion says "suspicion of staining failing," which might mean the tests couldn't confirm. So the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed. The initial exam found normal cells, but some suspicious formations. However, since the staining might have failed, they can't verify. So the answer here is NA because it's uncertain. Wait, but the user says "were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, then the answer is no. But the presence of suspicious formations might be considered as possible, but since the conclusion is that the staining failed, they can't confirm. So maybe the answer is no because the malignant findings weren't confirmed. Or maybe NA because the results are inconclusive. The user's allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignant tumors, and the conclusion is about the staining possibly failing, I think the answer here is no. Wait, but the initial exam found normal basal cells, which is a benign finding. So maybe the answer is no. Let me check again. The text says "normal basal cells were observed," which is a sign of benign tissue. The suspicious formations were in earlier samples where the staining might have failed, so they couldn't verify. So the conclusion is that most material showed expected patterns (benign), but some had issues. So the malignant finding would be no. 

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is no, the Gleason grade is NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Let me verify once more. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. Malignant is no because the findings were inconclusive but the main observation was normal cells. Gleason grade only applies if malignant, so NA. That seems right.
