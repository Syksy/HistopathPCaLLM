Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. So the original type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "suspicio-löydös" (suspicious finding) but states that a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made ("varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa") and concludes "benigniin päin" (towards benign). So the malignancy is not confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since it's suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, maybe "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy, but the instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If it's suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "ei"? The answer should be "ei" because they can't confirm malignancy. So the second field is "ei."

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA." Since the malignancy is not confirmed (benign), the Gleason should be "NA."

Let me double-check. The sample type is biopsy. Malignancy is not present (ei), and Gleason is NA. That seems right. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because it's not confirmed as cancer. So the JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
