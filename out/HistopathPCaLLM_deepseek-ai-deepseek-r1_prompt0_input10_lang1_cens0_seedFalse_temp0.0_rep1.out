Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report states "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" and "benigniin päin." This suggests suspicion but no definitive cancer diagnosis. The options are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since it's not confirmed, but there's suspicion, but the final conclusion leans benign, maybe "ei" is appropriate here. But wait, the question is about presence of malignant findings. If the diagnosis is uncertain but leans benign, then the answer should be "ei."

Third, Gleason grade. Since the conclusion is benign or uncertain without confirmed malignancy, the Gleason score would be "NA" as per the instructions. Only malignant cases get the major+minor=sum format.

So the JSON should be:
1. "biopsy"
2. "ei"
3. "NA"

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text doesn't mention any confirmed cancer, so malignancy is "ei," hence Gleason is NA.

  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",

  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
