Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says there's a suspicion ("Suspicio-löydös") but the diagnosis is uncertain, leaning towards benign ("benigniin päin"). The options are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since it's not confirmed as malignant, the answer here is "ei."

For Gleason grade, the report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. The immunostains are discussed, but there's no specific major+minor=sum format. Since the diagnosis is benign, the Gleason field should be "NA."

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and only the worst lesion is considered. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled appropriately based on the given text.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
