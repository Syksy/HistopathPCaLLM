Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The allowed values are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" which means the suspected focus is very small and a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made. The conclusion mentions "benigniin päin," leaning towards benign. So the malignant findings are not confirmed. The answer here should be "ei."

Third, the Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum as integers, or NA if benign. Since the diagnosis is uncertain and leans benign, there's no Gleason reported. So this should be "NA."

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and only the worst lesion's results. The sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason is NA. That should cover all three fields accurately.
