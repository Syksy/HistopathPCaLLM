Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä 8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita..." The key term here is "systeemibiopsioita", which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" which means the suspected focus is very small and a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made. The conclusion states "Suspicio-löydös biopsioista, mutta diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin." So there's suspicion but not confirmed malignancy. Since the question is about malignant findings, and the diagnosis is uncertain leaning towards benign, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy reported.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the second field is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even though there's a suspicion, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable here.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignant findings: the report says they can't confirm cancer, so "ei". Gleason: not applicable. That seems correct. No nested structures, just the three fields. The JSON syntax should be correct with the specified keys and values.
