Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "systeemibiopsioita tyyppipaikoista" which translates to systematic biopsies from specific sites. So the original type is biopsy.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" which means the suspected focus is very small and a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made. The conclusion states "benigniin päin" (towards benign). So the malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, since there's no confirmed malignancy, the value should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because the diagnosis is uncertain and leans benign. 

I need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, using the specified keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just flat. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. That fits the requirements.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
