Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. The text mentions "prostatanäytteet" which translates to prostate samples. However, there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states that in the preliminary examination, normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material. The mention of "normaalia basaalisolukkoa" (normal basal tissue) suggests no malignancy. However, there's a mention of experimental immunological stains showing clear patterns in the last two samples, but this seems related to the staining panel's functionality, not necessarily malignancy. The conclusion also talks about suspected staining failures but doesn't indicate cancer. So, the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there's no mention of any malignant findings, the Gleason score wouldn't be applicable. The report doesn't discuss cancer grades or scores. Hence, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but since there's no malignancy, all fields related to that are NA. Also, the JSON structure shouldn't be nested. Let me double-check the text for any possible mentions I might have missed. The key points are normal basal tissue and staining issues, but no cancer indicators. So the structured data should be as I concluded.
