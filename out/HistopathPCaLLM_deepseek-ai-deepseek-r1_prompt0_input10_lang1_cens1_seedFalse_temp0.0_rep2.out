Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. The report mentions "prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which translates to prostate tissue material. However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the original type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that in the initial examination, normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue. There's a mention of suspicious patterns in some samples related to staining failures, but the conclusion doesn't indicate any confirmed malignancy. The key point here is that there's no explicit mention of cancer or malignant findings. The immunostaining panel's reliability was in question, but the main tissue showed expected patterns. So, the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since we determined there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The answer seems straightforward here as there's no mention of any Gleason scoring. All three fields should be "NA", "ei", and "NA" respectively.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
