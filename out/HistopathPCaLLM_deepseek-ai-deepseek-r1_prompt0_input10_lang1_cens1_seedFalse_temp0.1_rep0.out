Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. The text mentions "prostatanäytteet" (prostate samples) but doesn't specify the type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So there's no clear indication here. Therefore, the original type should be NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states that in the preliminary examination, normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate material. However, in the last two samples, clear patterns emerged in the immunohistochemical panel, confirming the panel works. But there's mention of suspicious shapes in earlier samples suggesting staining failed. However, the conclusion mentions suspicion of staining failure in some samples, but most showed expected patterns. Importantly, there's no mention of cancer cells, tumors, or malignancy. The presence of normal basal tissue and issues with staining don't equate to malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is major+minor=sum. Since there's no malignancy detected (as per the previous answer), the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some suspicious findings, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scoring. The staining issues relate to the panel's reliability, not tumor grading. So definitely NA here.

I need to make sure each field is correctly mapped. No nested structures, just the three top-level keys. Also, check that the JSON syntax is correct, using double quotes and proper commas. Let me verify once more: sample type not specified (NA), no malignancy (ei), Gleason NA. Yep, that's accurate based on the text provided.
