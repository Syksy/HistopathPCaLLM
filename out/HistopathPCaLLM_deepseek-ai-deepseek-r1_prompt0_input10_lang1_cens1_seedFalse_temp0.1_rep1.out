Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. The report mentions "prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which translates to prostate tissue material. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be NA.

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The text mentions "normaalia basaalisolukkoa" (normal basal tissue) in the preliminary examination. The immunostaining panels showed clear patterns in the last two samples, but there were issues with staining in earlier samples. However, the conclusion doesn't mention any malignancy, just suspicion of staining failure. Since there's no mention of cancer cells or malignancy, the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade should be NA. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. No malignancy mentioned, so "ei". Therefore, Gleason is NA. That seems correct.
