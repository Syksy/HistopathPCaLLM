Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which translates to prostate tissue material. But there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about samples arriving in eight separate batches due to a logistics error, but no clear indication of the procedure type. So I think the original type is NA here.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report says "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin" which means normal basal tissue was found. There's mention of experimental immunological stain panels showing clear patterns in the last two samples, but the conclusion is suspicion of staining failure in some samples. However, no mention of cancer cells or malignancy. So the presence of malignancy is likely "ei".

For Gleason grade, it's supposed to be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy, this should be NA.

Wait, but I need to double-check. The text mentions "epäilys" (suspicion) of staining failure, but the main finding is normal basal tissue. No mention of carcinoma or Gleason patterns. So yes, malignancy is "ei", Gleason NA. Sample type not specified, so NA. That seems right.
