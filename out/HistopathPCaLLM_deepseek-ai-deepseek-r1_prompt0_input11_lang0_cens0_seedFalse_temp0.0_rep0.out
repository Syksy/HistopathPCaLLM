Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Since prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, which is a radical prostatectomy, the sample type here should be RP. So that's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and specifically mentions a "malignant focus." So the answer here is definitely yes. Even though there's a mention of high-grade PIN (which is a precursor but not malignant), the main finding is malignant. So that's a yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says "Gleason grading 4+3." So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The user wants it in the format "4+3=7". Since this is a malignant case, we report that. If it were benign, we'd put NA, but here it's clearly provided.

Now, making sure to only take the most severe lesion. The report mentions a Gleason 4+3, which is a higher grade than if there were lower scores elsewhere. The other findings like high-grade PIN and the basis being free don't affect the most severe lesion, which is the 4+3. So that's the one to report.

No nested structures in the JSON, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check the sample type again. The term "prostatectomy preparate" is used, which aligns with RP. TURP is a different procedure, so RP is correct. Malignant is confirmed, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All set.
