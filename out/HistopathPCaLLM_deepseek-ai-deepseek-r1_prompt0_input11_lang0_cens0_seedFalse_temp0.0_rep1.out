Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Since prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, which is a radical prostatectomy, the sample type here should be RP. So that's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and specifically mentions a "malignant focus." So the answer here is definitely yes. Even though there's a mention of high-grade PIN (which is a precursor but not malignant), the main finding is malignant. So that's a yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says "Gleason grading 4+3." So that's straightforward. The major pattern is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7". Since this is a malignant case, we don't have to worry about it being NA.

Now, making sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions a malignant focus with Gleason 4+3, and other areas like the basis and vehicles are free. So the most severe is the 4+3. High-grade PIN is noted but not a tumor, so it's irrelevant for the Gleason grade.

Putting it all together in JSON without nested structures. The keys are the three fields, each with their respective values. Need to ensure the JSON is valid, so proper quotes and syntax. Let me double-check the values: sample type RP, malignant yes, Gleason 4+3=7. Yep, that's all there. No other lesions mentioned that are more severe. Margins are clean, but that's about the margins, not the tumor grade. Alright, that should be it.
