Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, there's mention of "prepared sampleset" and "prostate tissue" observed microscopically. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample type isn't specified, so I should put NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "fractions of the most usual Gleason scores... score 4 and score 3" but says they couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was investigated. High-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is mentioned as inconclusive. Since Gleason scores are related to cancer grading, but the assessment is uncertain and there's no clear mention of malignancy, the presence of a malignant tumor isn't confirmed. So, the answer here would be no. Wait, but high-grade PIN is a precursor, not cancer. So if there's no confirmed malignancy, then malignant findings would be no. But the report doesn't explicitly say "malignant tumor present," so maybe it's safer to go with no.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (answer to question 2 is no), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even though they mention scores 4 and 3, those couldn't be reliably assessed, and only 5% was examined. So the Gleason grade isn't reportable here. Therefore, NA is appropriate.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Let me double-check each part. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. Malignant findings are no because there's no confirmation. Gleason is NA because it's inconclusive and the case is benign. Yep, that makes sense.
