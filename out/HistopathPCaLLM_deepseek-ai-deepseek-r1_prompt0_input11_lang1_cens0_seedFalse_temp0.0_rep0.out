Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti käynnistetään protokollan mukaisesti..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to a prostatectomy specimen. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, there's "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". So, 4+3=7. Since there's a malignancy, we report this as "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions a malignant focus in the apex and central part, covering about 15% of the area. There's also high-grade PIN, but that's not malignant. The main Gleason score given is 4+3, which is the primary and secondary patterns. No other higher grades are mentioned, so this is the correct one.

Margins are clean, and no malignancy in the base or seminal vesicles, but that doesn't affect the main points here. The sample type is definitely RP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All other details can be ignored as per the instructions to focus only on the required fields and the worst lesion.
