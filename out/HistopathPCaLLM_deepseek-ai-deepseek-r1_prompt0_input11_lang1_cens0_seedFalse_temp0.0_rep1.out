Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here is RP.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus. Also, there's "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. So that's 4+3=7. Since there's a malignancy, we don't use NA here.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. All other details like high-grade PIN or margins aren't needed here. The worst lesion is considered, which is the 4+3. Okay, that's all covered.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
