Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, so the sample type here is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus, and "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So definitely malignant. The answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The format required is "major+minor=sum", so 4+3=7. Need to present it as a string in that exact format.

Now, making sure there are no nested structures. The other details like high-grade PIN or margins aren't needed here. Only the worst lesion's results are considered, which in this case is the 4+3 Gleason score. The presence of malignancy is confirmed, so Gleason isn't NA. The sample type is RP, not biopsy or TURP. All other info like weight, size, or percentage area isn't required for these fields.

Double-checking the allowed values: sample type is correct as RP. Malignancy is "kyllä". Gleason is "4+3=7". No issues there. So the JSON should have those three key-value pairs without any nesting.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
