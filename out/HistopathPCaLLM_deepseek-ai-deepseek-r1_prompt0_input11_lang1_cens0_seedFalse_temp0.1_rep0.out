Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

2. **Malignancy Presence**: The report states "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus. Also, "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" refers to invasive tumor tissue. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The text explicitly mentions "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The format required is "major+minor=sum", so it should be "4+3=7". Since there's a malignancy, we don't use NA here.

Other points to check: The report mentions high-grade PIN around the tumor, but that's not malignant. Margins are clear, and no malignancy in the base or seminal vesicles. But the main points are covered. The sample type is definitely RP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 4+3=7. No nested structures needed, just straightforward answers.
