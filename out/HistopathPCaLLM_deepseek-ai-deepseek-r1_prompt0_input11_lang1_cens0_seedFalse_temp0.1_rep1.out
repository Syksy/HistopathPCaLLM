Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. In medical terms, RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus, and mentions "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the presence of malignancy is definitely "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report explicitly says "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The text mentions that the malignant focus is up to 3 cm in the apex and central part, involving about 15% of the area. There's also high-grade PIN around the tumor, but that's not a malignancy. The margins are clear, and no malignancy in the base or seminal vesicles. So the primary malignancy is the 4+3 Gleason score.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check each field:

1. Original type: RP (correct, as it's a prostatectomy specimen).
2. Malignancy present: kyllä (yes, confirmed by malignant focus).
3. Gleason: 4+3=7 (exactly as reported).

Everything seems to fit. No issues with the allowed values. Time to structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
