Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the report mentions "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) and mentions that all parts of the prostate were examined. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text starts with "Valmisteltu näytesetti" which translates to "prepared sample set," but without specific terms, I might have to default to NA here.

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report talks about "Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista" (Gleason scoring components) with values 4 and 3. Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer grading, so the presence of these scores suggests malignancy. However, the text also says that only about 5% of the material could be examined, and they couldn't reliably assess some parts. But since Gleason components are mentioned, even if uncertain, it indicates that there were malignant findings. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The report mentions values 4 and 3. Typically, the higher number is the major pattern and the lower is minor. So 4 + 3 = 7. But wait, the text says "arvot 4 ja 3" but also states that they couldn't reliably examine some parts. However, the user instructions specify to report the worst lesion's results. Even with uncertainty, if they reported 4 and 3, we should take that. So the Gleason would be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the user said to only include the worst lesion and avoid nested structures. The report mentions that only 5% of the material was examined, but they still assigned Gleason components. So despite the small sample, the presence of 4 and 3 would be the reported grade. So the answer is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (since no explicit procedure mentioned)
2. Malignancy: kyllä (due to Gleason scores)
3. Gleason: 4+3=7
