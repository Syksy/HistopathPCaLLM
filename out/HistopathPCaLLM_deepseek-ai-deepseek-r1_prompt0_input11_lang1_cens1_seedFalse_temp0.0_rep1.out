Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the report mentions "Valmisteltu näytesetti" which translates to "prepared sample set". However, there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So, I can't determine the sample type from the given text. Therefore, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The text says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan prostatasolukkoa, mikä vaikuttaa muodostavan putkimaisia rakenteita vaihtelevilla erilaistumisasteilla." This translates to observing prostate tissue forming tubular structures with varying degrees of differentiation. The mention of Gleason scores 4 and 3 suggests malignancy because Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer grading. However, the report also states that only about 5% of the material could be examined, and the assessment of high-grade PIN changes is left unfulfilled due to unreliability. Despite the uncertainty, the presence of Gleason components 4 and 3 indicates malignancy. So, the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista... arvot 4 ja 3". Typically, the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns are reported. However, the order here is 4 and 3. In Gleason scoring, the higher grade is listed first if there are two patterns. But if the sample is a biopsy, the primary is the most common pattern, and secondary is the next most common. However, the text doesn't specify the sample type. But given that the components are 4 and 3, the major would be 4 and minor 3, summing to 7. So, the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the report says "Osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteissa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan, sillä vain noin 5% koko materiaalista pystyttiin tutkimaan." This translates to parts of the most common Gleason components in such situations, values 4 and 3, couldn't be reliably examined because only about 5% of the material was examined. So, does that mean the Gleason score is uncertain? The user instruction says to report the Gleason grade for malignant findings. Since malignancy is present (kyllä), but the Gleason components couldn't be reliably assessed, should the Gleason grade be "NA"? Wait, the question states: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So, if the findings are malignant, we need to report the Gleason grade. But if the examination was unreliable, do we still report it? The text says "arvot 4 ja 3" were parts of the components but couldn't be reliably assessed. However, the report still mentions 4 and 3. Maybe the pathologist is indicating that these are the components observed, but the reliability is low. But the user's instruction says to report the Gleason grade as per the report. So even if it's uncertain, if it's mentioned, we should take it. But the problem is that the user wants "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). But in this case, the report says that only 5% of the material was examined, so maybe the Gleason score isn't reliable. However, the presence of components 4 and 3 is mentioned. The user's instruction says to report the Gleason grade for malignant cases. So perhaps we should report 4+3=7, even if it's uncertain. But the text says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" (could not be reliably examined). Does that mean the Gleason score is not reported, hence "NA"? Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The key is whether the Gleason grade was reported despite the uncertainty. The text mentions the values 4 and 3 as components, but the examination was unreliable. So, perhaps the Gleason grade isn't reliably determined, so we should put "NA". But the user's instruction says to report the Gleason grade for malignant cases. Alternatively, maybe the pathologist is indicating that the Gleason components are 4 and 3, but due to limited material, the assessment is uncertain. However, the user wants the worst lesion's results. If the components are 4 and 3, even if uncertain, maybe we should report them. But the problem is that the report states that they couldn't be reliably examined. So, perhaps the correct answer is "NA" for the Gleason grade because it's not reliable. But I need to check the exact wording. The text says "Osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteissa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan..." So, the components 4 and 3 are parts of the common ones in this situation, but they couldn't be reliably examined. Therefore, the Gleason grade isn't reliably determined, so the answer should be "NA". But wait, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so according to the instructions, if malignant, the Gleason should be reported. But if it's not reliably determined, maybe "NA" is still acceptable. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant, "NA" for benign. But in this case, it's malignant but the Gleason couldn't be assessed reliably. The user's instruction says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (what was the reported Gleason grade). The text does mention "arvot 4 ja 3" but states that they couldn't be reliably examined. So, was a Gleason grade actually reported? It seems like the pathologist is noting the presence of components 4 and 3 but is unsure due to limited material. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade might not be definitively stated. In such cases, the answer should be "NA" because the report doesn't provide a reliable Gleason score. Alternatively, if the components are mentioned despite uncertainty, maybe it's 4+3=7. But the key is whether the report includes a Gleason score. The text says "arvot 4 ja 3" but also says they couldn't be reliably examined. So, perhaps the Gleason grade isn't officially reported, hence "NA". This is a bit ambiguous, but I think the safest answer here is "NA" for the Gleason grade because the report states that the components couldn't be reliably assessed. Therefore, even though malignancy is present, the Gleason grade isn't reliably determined and thus not reported.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita suoraan tekstissä (esim. "biopsia", "RP" tai "TURP"), joten arvo on "NA".  
2. Löydökset viittaavat pahanlaatuisuuteen: Gleason-komponentit 4 ja 3 mainitaan (vaikkakin epäluotettavasti), ja PIN-muutoksia ei suljeta pois.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei voida luotettavasti määrittää, koska vain 5% näytteestä oli arvioitavissa, eikä summaa raportoida eksplisiittisesti.
