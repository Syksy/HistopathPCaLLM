Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "Valmisteltu näytesetti" which translates to prepared sample set. There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) forming tubular structures with varying differentiation. Gleason components 4 and 3 are mentioned, but they couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was examined. High-grade PIN changes were requested but couldn't be evaluated. However, the presence of Gleason patterns (even if not fully assessable) suggests malignancy. So the answer should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions components 4 and 3. Normally, Gleason is major + minor = sum. But the text states that these couldn't be reliably examined due to limited material (only 5%). Since they couldn't assess it reliably, even though they mention 4 and 3, we can't take that as a definitive sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be NA here because the assessment wasn't reliable. Wait, but the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so maybe they should report the sum even if it's uncertain? Hmm. The instructions say to report "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant cases. However, in this case, the components are mentioned but the reliability is questioned. The user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results), but if they can't reliably assess, maybe it's still NA. But the presence of 4 and 3 is noted. Wait, the text says "osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteessa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan". So they saw components 4 and 3 but couldn't reliably examine them. Since the user wants the worst lesion's results, maybe we should take the highest possible. But the problem is that the sum isn't provided, and the components are mentioned but not confirmed. The instructions say to report "major+minor=sum" as integers. If they can't determine it reliably, maybe it's NA. But the presence of 4 and 3 might imply a sum of 4+3=7. However, the text says they couldn't reliably assess. So perhaps the Gleason grade here is NA because the assessment wasn't reliable, even though malignancy is present. But I need to check the user's instructions again. The third field should be "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. Since malignancy is "kyllä", but the Gleason couldn't be reliably determined, maybe it's NA. Alternatively, if they mention the components, even if unreliable, should we report them? The user says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (reported Gleason grade). The text says the components 4 and 3 were present but couldn't be reliably assessed. So the report doesn't give a definitive sum. Therefore, the answer is NA for Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita tekstissä suoraan (ei viitata biopsy, RP, TURP).
2. Löydökset sisältävät Gleason-komponentteja (4 ja 3), jotka viittaavat pahanlaatuisuuteen, vaikka luotettavaa arviointia ei voitu tehdä.
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei voida määrittää luotettavasti tekstin perusteella, koska arviointi epäonnistui materiaalin vähäisyyden vuoksi (*"ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan"*).
