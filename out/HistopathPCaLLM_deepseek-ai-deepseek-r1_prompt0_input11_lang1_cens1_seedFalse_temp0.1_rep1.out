Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the report, there's no mention of how the sample was obtained. It just says "Valmisteltu näytesetti" which means prepared sample set. No specific procedure like TURP or biopsy is noted. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report mentions "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) forming tubular structures with varying differentiation. Gleason components 4 and 3 are mentioned, but they couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was examined. However, Gleason 4 is a higher grade, which is malignant. Even though the assessment is uncertain, the presence of Gleason patterns indicates malignancy. So the answer should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the components mentioned are 4 and 3. But the text says they couldn't reliably examine the most common components, and only 5% was examined. However, the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Even if uncertain, the highest reported is 4+3. But wait, the standard format is major + minor = sum. If 4 is the major and 3 is minor, it would be 4+3=7. But the problem is the text says "osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteessa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan". So they saw components 4 and 3 but couldn't assess reliably. However, since the user wants the worst lesion's results, maybe we should report 4+3=7. But the uncertainty here is tricky. The instructions say to report the Gleason grade for malignant cases. Since malignancy is present, but the Gleason couldn't be reliably determined, maybe it's NA? Wait, no. The presence of Gleason 4 and 3 is mentioned, even if uncertain. The user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" so take the highest reported. So even if uncertain, the report mentions 4 and 3, so sum is 7. But the problem is the text says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan". So maybe the Gleason isn't reliably determined. But the user's instruction says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" which is the reported one. So even if uncertain, if it's reported as 4 and 3, then the answer is 4+3=7. But the text says "arvot 4 ja 3" but couldn't be reliably examined. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the Gleason score was actually reported or not. The text says "osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista... arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan". So they tried to look at components 4 and 3 but couldn't assess them reliably. Therefore, the Gleason score isn't reliably determined. But the user wants the reported Gleason. If they mention 4 and 3 but couldn't assess, should we still report it? The instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". So if the report mentions 4 and 3, even if uncertain, maybe we should put that. But the problem is that the sum is 7, but the reliability is low. However, the user's instructions don't mention reliability; they just want the reported one. So the answer would be "4+3=7". But wait, the text says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" which might mean that the Gleason score isn't reported. So maybe the answer is NA. But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so if Gleason can't be determined, it's NA? Wait, the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. So if malignancy is present, but Gleason isn't reliably reported, then it's NA. But the text does mention Gleason components 4 and 3, even if unreliable. So perhaps the answer is "4+3=7" but the system might expect that. Alternatively, if the assessment is unreliable, maybe it's NA. This is a bit of a judgment call. The key is whether the components are reported despite uncertainty. Since the components are mentioned (4 and 3), even if unreliable, maybe we should report them. But the user instruction says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". So if the report states the values 4 and 3, even with uncertainty, then it's reported. Therefore, the answer is "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita suoraan (esim. biopsy, RP, TURP), joten arvo "NA".  
2. Gleason-komponentit 4 (pahanlaatuinen) ja 3 mainitaan, vaikka luotettavuus rajoittuu. Tämä viittaa maligniteettiin.  
3. Gleason-arvot 4+3=7 on raportoitu, vaikka analyysi epäilee luotettavuutta. Ohjeiden mukaan palautetaan pahimman leesion tulokset.
