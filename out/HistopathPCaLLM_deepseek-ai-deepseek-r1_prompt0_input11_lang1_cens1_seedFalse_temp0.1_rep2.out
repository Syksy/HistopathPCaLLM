Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, there's no mention of specific procedures like TURP or RP. The report mentions "näytesetti" which translates to "set of samples" but doesn't specify the type. So, the original type isn't provided, hence NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) with structures forming tubular patterns and Gleason components 4 and 3. However, it also states that only about 5% of the material could be examined, and high-grade PIN changes couldn't be reliably assessed. Gleason scoring is typically for malignancies, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm cancer. The presence of Gleason components 4 and 3 might suggest malignancy, but since they couldn't reliably examine most of the material, there's uncertainty. The answer here might be "kyllä" (yes) because Gleason scores are mentioned, but the uncertainty could lead to "NA". Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the Gleason is reported, even if partial, does that imply malignancy? The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since Gleason 4 is a component (which is cancerous), even if minor, the presence would indicate malignancy. So, the answer should be "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions components 4 and 3, but it's unclear which is major or minor because they couldn't reliably assess them. However, typically the higher number is the major. If they mention 4 and 3, maybe the major is 4 and minor 3, making sum 7. But the report says "osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteissa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" – parts of the components 4 and 3 couldn't be reliably examined. So, maybe they can't assign a reliable Gleason score. But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's Gleason. If they mention 4 and 3 but couldn't assess, should it be NA? Wait, the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. Since malignancy is "kyllä", but the Gleason couldn't be reliably determined, perhaps the answer is NA. But the presence of 4 and 3 components might still be reported. However, the text says they couldn't reliably examine them, so maybe the Gleason is not reliably determined. Hence, NA. But the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If they mention components 4 and 3, even if partial, maybe the sum is 4+3=7. But the uncertainty in the report complicates this. The correct approach here is to check if a Gleason score was reported. The text says "arvot 4 ja 3" but couldn't be reliably assessed. So, the Gleason grade isn't definitively reported, hence NA.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```

**Perustelut:**  
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita tekstissä (ei viittauksia biopsy/RP/TURP), joten arvo on "NA".  
2. Gleason-komponentit 4 ja 3 viittaavat pahanlaatuisuuteen, vaikka osaa tutkimuksesta ei pystytty varmistamaan.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei voida määrittää luotettavasti, koska vain 5% materiaalista tutkittiin ja arviointi epäonnistui (teksti: *"ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan"*).
