Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed using an electrified loop. So the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report states that the majority of the sample is classified as benign. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the sample is benign, Gleason grade isn't applicable. So that's "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions beyond benign tissue. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me verify each part again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. That all fits the criteria.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
