Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The input text is: 

"The obtained sample consist of electrosection shavings from the prostate and have been started in eight blocks. In histological examination, majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue like architecture, thus the material is classified as benign."

First, I need to answer the three structured fields. Let's start with the first one: original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "electrosection shavings." Electrosection is often associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed using an electrified loop. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, the second field: malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the majority of the sample is normal and classified as benign. So the answer here should be "no."

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. So this should be "NA."

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since the sample is benign, there's no malignancy to report. The JSON structure shouldn't have any nesting. Let me double-check each part. Electrosection shavings do point to TURP. Benign classification means no malignancy. Gleason grade isn't applicable here. Everything seems to fit. No nested structures, just the three key-value pairs. Alright, ready to format the JSON.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
