Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The input text is: 

"The obtained sample consist of electrosection shavings from the prostate and have been started in eight blocks. In histological examination, majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue like architecture, thus the material is classified as benign."

First, I need to answer the three structured fields. Let's break them down one by one.

1. Original sample type: The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP procedures. So, the sample type here is TURP.

2. Malignant tumor findings: The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the material is classified as benign. Benign means no malignancy, so the answer here is "no."

3. Gleason grade: The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. So, this should be "NA."

Now, I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion's results are considered. Since the entire sample is benign, there's no malignancy, so all three answers are straightforward. No nested structures, just a flat JSON with these three keys. Let me double-check each part again to confirm. Electrosection shavings = TURP. Benign = no malignancy. No Gleason grade needed. Yep, that all lines up.
