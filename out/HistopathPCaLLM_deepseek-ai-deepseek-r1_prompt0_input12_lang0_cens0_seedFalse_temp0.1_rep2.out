Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to convert the free-text statement into a JSON format with three specific fields.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. So the sample type here is "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report states that the majority of the sample is classified as benign. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. So this field should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy mentioned. The JSON should not have nested structures, so each field is a top-level key. Let me double-check the values to make sure they fit the allowed options. Everything seems to align. Now, structuring the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
