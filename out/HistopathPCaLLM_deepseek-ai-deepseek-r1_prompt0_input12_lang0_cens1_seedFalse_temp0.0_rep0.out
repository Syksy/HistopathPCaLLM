Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of how the sample was obtained. It just says it's prostate cancer tissue. So the sample type isn't specified here. So the answer for the first field should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement clearly says "prostate cancer tissue," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if available. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being queued, but no specific numbers. So the Gleason grade isn't provided here. Therefore, the answer is NA.

I need to make sure I'm not including any nested structures and only taking the most severe lesion into account. Since there's no conflicting information, the answers are straightforward. The JSON should have the three fields with the determined values.

  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
