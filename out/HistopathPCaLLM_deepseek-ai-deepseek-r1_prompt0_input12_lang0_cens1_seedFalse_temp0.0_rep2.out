Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if available. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination but doesn't specify the grading. So the answer here is NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since the text doesn't mention multiple lesions, this is straightforward. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each field again to confirm. Yep, sample type isn't specified, malignancy is present, and Gleason isn't mentioned. So the final JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
