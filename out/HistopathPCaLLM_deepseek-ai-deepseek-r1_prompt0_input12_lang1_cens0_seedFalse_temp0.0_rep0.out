Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The sample mentioned here is "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". I recall that TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which is a procedure often done for benign prostatic hyperplasia. "Elektrosektio" might refer to electroresection, which aligns with TURP. So the first field should be "TURP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason score, since the findings are benign, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The user specified that only the worst lesion's results are to be reported, and since there's no malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable.

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. Let me double-check each field. Sample type is TURP, malignant findings are "ei", Gleason is NA. That fits all the criteria. No typos, and the values are within the allowed options. Looks good.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
