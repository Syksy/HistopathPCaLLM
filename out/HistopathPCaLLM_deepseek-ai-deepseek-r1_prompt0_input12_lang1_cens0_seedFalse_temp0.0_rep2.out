Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". The term "elektrosektio" translates to electrosection, which is part of a TURP procedure. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So the presence of malignant findings is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the instruction is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the findings are benign, Gleason score isn't applicable here. So it's NA.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The answer should be straightforward with the three keys and appropriate values. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything. Yes, elektrosektio does correspond to TURP, benign means no malignancy, and Gleason is NA. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
