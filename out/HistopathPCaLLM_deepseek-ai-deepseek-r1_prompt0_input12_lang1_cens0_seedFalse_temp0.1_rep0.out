Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Elektrosektio might refer to TURP, since TURP is a procedure where tissue is removed, often using electrical current. So I'll go with "TURP" here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which translates to the findings being benign. So the answer here should be "ei" (no malignant findings).

For the Gleason grade, since the sample is benign, the allowed value is "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason scoring because there's no cancer detected.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the terms to ensure accuracy. Yes, elektrosektio does correspond to TURP. The rest seems straightforward. No errors spotted.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
