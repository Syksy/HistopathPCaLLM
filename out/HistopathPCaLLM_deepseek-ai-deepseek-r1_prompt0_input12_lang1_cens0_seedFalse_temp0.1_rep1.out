Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". I recall that "TURP" stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed using an electrified loop, often for benign enlargement. "Elektrosektio" likely refers to electroresection, so the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which translates to the findings being benign. So, the answer here is "ei" (no malignant findings).

For the Gleason grade, since the sample is benign, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The allowed values are correctly applied. Let me double-check each field. Sample type is TURP, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That seems right. No conflicting information in the text. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
