Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The term "elektrosektiolastut" translates to electroresection chips, which are typically obtained from a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since the findings are benign, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions specify that for benign cases, the Gleason should be "NA". So that field is straightforward.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON output and only include the worst lesion's results. The example given doesn't mention multiple lesions, just benign tissue. So all three fields are filled accordingly without any issues.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
