Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa," which translates to "initiated in eight parts." That phrasing is a bit unclear. Typically, biopsies are taken in multiple cores or parts. RP and TURP are surgical procedures. Since the text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue), it's likely a biopsy taken to check for cancer, especially since it's divided into parts. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta, mutta korkearesoluutioiset kuvat ovat toistaiseksi odottamassa digipatologian jonossa." So the high-resolution images are pending. The report doesn't mention any cancer found yet; it's still waiting. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and the presence is pending further analysis, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't state any malignant findings yet. Alternatively, if the presence is uncertain, maybe "NA"? But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, and it's still pending, perhaps "ei" is appropriate, assuming that the initial assessment didn't find malignancy. But maybe the answer is NA because the analysis isn't complete. Hmm. The question is, "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" If the report doesn't state any, even if pending, then the answer is "ei". But if the report is inconclusive because the images are pending, maybe NA. However, the user instructions say to process the given text as is. The text doesn't mention any malignancy found, only that the sample is suspected. So "ei" would be correct because no malignancy is confirmed in the current findings. 

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. 

So putting it all together:
1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
