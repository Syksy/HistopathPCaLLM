Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa," which translates to started in eight parts. That phrasing is a bit unclear. Typically, biopsies are taken in multiple cores or parts. RP and TURP are surgical procedures. Since the text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue), and being divided into parts, this might be a biopsy. However, the term "käynnistetty" (initiated) is a bit ambiguous. But given that it's divided into parts and is a suspected sample, biopsy seems likely. However, the report also mentions that high-resolution images are pending in the digital pathology queue, which is common in biopsies. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states that the sample is from suspected cancer tissue, but the actual histological examination results aren't provided yet. The high-resolution images are still pending. So the report doesn't confirm malignancy; it's still under investigation. Therefore, the presence of malignancy can't be confirmed here. The answer should be "ei" (no) because there's no mention of confirmed malignancy, only suspicion. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the examination hasn't been completed yet (images pending), then maybe the result isn't available. But the first part says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta" (most of the sample appears to be from the prostate). But no mention of cancer cells found. Since the analysis isn't complete, maybe the answer is "ei" because they haven't found malignancy yet, or "NA" because the results are pending. The allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't state any malignancy found, and the analysis is pending, perhaps the correct answer is "ei" (no) because as of now, no malignancy is reported. Alternatively, if the results are pending, maybe NA. But the question is "oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report doesn't confirm any, then it's "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since we determined malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there was suspicion, until confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So the answer here is "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA
