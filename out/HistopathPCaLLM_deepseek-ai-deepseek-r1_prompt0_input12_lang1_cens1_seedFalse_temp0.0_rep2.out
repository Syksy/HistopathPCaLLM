Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa," which translates to something like initiated in eight parts. That doesn't clearly indicate biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions the sample is from suspected cancer tissue but doesn't specify the procedure. So maybe the original type isn't mentioned here, so I should put NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states it's suspected cancer tissue ("epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta"), but the high-resolution images are still pending. So the histology hasn't confirmed malignancy yet. The wording is about suspicion, not confirmation. So the answer here would be "ei" because no malignant findings are confirmed yet, or maybe NA? Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the report is pending images, maybe the result isn't conclusive. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the examination hasn't found malignancy yet, then the answer would be "ei" or maybe NA. But the text says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta" which means most of the sample is from the prostate, but no mention of cancer cells found. Since it's still pending, perhaps the presence is not confirmed, so "ei" or NA. The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report is pending, maybe NA is better here. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the analysis is not complete because images are pending, then maybe the answer is NA because the result isn't available yet. But the initial part says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which is suspected cancer tissue. However, the actual histological examination hasn't confirmed it yet. So the presence is not determined, hence NA. Hmm, but the user might expect that if it's suspected but not confirmed, then the answer is "ei" because the report hasn't found it yet. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The sample is from suspected cancer, but the high-res images are pending, so the histology hasn't been completed. Therefore, the presence of malignancy hasn't been confirmed. So the answer should be NA because the data isn't available yet. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. So if the report doesn't state any malignant findings, and it's pending, then NA is appropriate.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. Since the presence of malignancy is NA (as per previous conclusion), the Gleason grade would be NA. But if the presence was "ei", then Gleason would be NA. Either way, in this case, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the sample type: the text says "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" which might refer to being processed in eight parts, but doesn't specify the procedure type. So original type is not mentioned, hence NA. 

So the final JSON would be:
{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "NA",
  "3": "NA"
}

But wait, let me check again. The sample is "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which is a biopsy? Because if it's a biopsy, then the original type would be biopsy. But the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. The term "käynnistetty" might mean initiated, but not sure. In medical terms, if it's a biopsy, it's often mentioned. Since it's not specified, the answer remains NA. 

So yes, all three fields are NA in this case.
