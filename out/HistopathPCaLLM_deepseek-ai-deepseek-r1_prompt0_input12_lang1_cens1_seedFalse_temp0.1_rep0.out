Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty", which translates to initiated or started. However, in medical context, "käynnistetty" might refer to how the sample was taken. The mention of "kahdeksassa osassa" (in eight parts) suggests a biopsy, as biopsies are often taken in multiple cores. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the report mentions that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. Since the examination is not complete yet, there's no confirmation of malignancy. The presence is still suspected but not confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the results are pending, the answer here should be "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed (still pending), the Gleason score can't be determined. So this field is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. The sample is initiated in eight parts, which aligns with biopsy cores. The malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, hence "NA". Gleason isn't reported yet, so "NA".

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
