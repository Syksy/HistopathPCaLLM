Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa," which translates to started in eight parts. That phrasing is a bit unclear. Common sample types like biopsy or TURP might be mentioned more explicitly. Since there's no clear mention of RP, TURP, or biopsy, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, presence of malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the next part says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta, mutta korkearesoluutioiset kuvat ovat toistaiseksi odottamassa digipatologian jonossa." So the high-resolution images are pending. The report doesn't confirm malignancy yet; it's still under suspicion and pending further analysis. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of cancer here, the answer should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report is pending, maybe NA is more appropriate. But the question specifies "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report hasn't confirmed yet, then technically, there's no malignant findings reported, so maybe "ei". Hmm, but the initial part says "epäillystä" which is suspected. However, the presence of malignancy is based on findings in the sample. Since the high-res images are pending, maybe the examination isn't complete. So the answer here might be "ei" because no malignancy has been confirmed yet. Alternatively, if the sample is still under examination, maybe NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the analysis is pending, then it's not determined yet, so NA. But the user instruction says to process the given text as is. The text doesn't state any malignancy found, just that it's suspected and pending. So perhaps the answer is "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. Or maybe NA because the results are pending. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original text again. The report says the sample consists of suspected cancer tissue, but the high-res images are still in the queue. So the histopathological examination isn't complete. Therefore, the presence of malignancy hasn't been confirmed yet, so the answer should be NA. Wait, but the second question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report is pending, then the answer isn't available, so NA. But if the sample is still being processed, maybe the presence is not yet determined, hence NA. So I think the answer here is NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the presence of malignancy is NA (pending), the Gleason would also be NA. But if the presence is "ei", then Gleason is NA. Either way, Gleason is NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA because it's not specified. Malignant findings are NA because the results are pending. Gleason is NA accordingly.

  "3": "NA"

**Perustelut:**  
1. Näytteen alkuperäistä tyyppiä (biopsy/RP/TURP) ei mainita raportissa, joten arvo on "NA".  
2. Pahanlaatuisuudesta ei voida varmuudella sanoa, koska korkearesoluutioiset kuvat (diagnostiikan kannalta kriittiset) ovat vielä odottamassa. Tämän vuoksi arvo on "NA".  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei raportoida, koska diagnostiikka on kesken eikä pahanlaatuisuutta ole vielä vahvistettu. Tämän vuoksi arvo on "NA".
