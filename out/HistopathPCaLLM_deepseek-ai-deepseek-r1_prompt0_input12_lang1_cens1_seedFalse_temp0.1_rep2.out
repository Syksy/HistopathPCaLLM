Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa," which translates to started in eight parts. That phrasing is a bit unclear. Typically, biopsies are taken in multiple cores or parts. RP and TURP are surgical specimens. Since the text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue), it's likely a biopsy taken to confirm cancer. But the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, the mention of being started in eight parts might refer to biopsy cores. So maybe "biopsy"? But I'm not 100% sure. If there's uncertainty, should it be NA? The instructions say to use NA if not specified. The text doesn't clearly state biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe NA here.

Second, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue), but the actual histology is pending high-resolution images in the digital pathology queue. So the examination isn't complete yet. Therefore, they haven't confirmed malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. Since the results are pending, the answer should be NA, because it's not determined yet. The report doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, just suspicion.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum. But since malignancy isn't confirmed (answer to #2 is NA), the Gleason should also be NA. Even if there were some mention, if the high-res images are pending, they can't assign a Gleason score yet. So definitely NA here.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since it's not explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings: NA (results pending)
3. Gleason: NA
