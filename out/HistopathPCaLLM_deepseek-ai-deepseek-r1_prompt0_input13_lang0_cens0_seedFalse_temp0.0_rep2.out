Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so the allowed value here is "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The preferred format is major + minor = sum. Here, 4+5=9. So the value should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The example mentions higher grade differentiation (4+5=9) in sample B, which is the highest mentioned, so that's correct. The other samples are normal, so we focus on the malignant one.

No nested structures in the JSON. Check allowed values again: sample type is biopsy, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. All valid. No NA needed here since all info is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
