Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so the allowed value here is "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The user wants the format "major+minor=sum." The numbers here are 4 and 5, summing to 9. So it should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The example mentions the higher grade (4+5=9) in sample B, which is the highest mentioned, so that's correct. The rest of the samples are normal, so they don't affect the result.

Check if the JSON is valid, no nested structures. All values are correctly filled with allowed terms. No NA needed here since all info is present.

  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
