Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as being taken from typical prostate locations, with more from the right side. The term "samples" and the context of being taken from the prostate without specifying a procedure like TURP or RP makes me think this is a biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The report mentions "some irregularities" in sample B with "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection." The term "suspicious pattern" is used, but it also states that further verification is needed. Since there's suspicion but no confirmation, the answer here isn't clearly "yes" or "no." The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's uncertain and pending consultation, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. However, the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The suspicious lesion might be considered as potential malignancy, but without confirmation, it's safer to go with "NA" because the presence isn't confirmed yet.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA." Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (we put "NA" for the second field), the Gleason grade should also be "NA." The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, just differentiation patterns that are suspicious but not graded yet.

So the structured data would be:
1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA
3. Gleason grade: NA

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Let me double-check the input text. No mention of RP or TURP procedures, just samples taken, so biopsy is correct. The suspicious findings aren't confirmed, so NA for malignancy. No Gleason provided, so NA. That seems right.

  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
