Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as being taken from typical prostate locations, with more from the right side. The term "samples" and the context of being taken from the prostate without specifying a procedure like TURP or RP makes me think this is a biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The report mentions "some irregularities" in sample B with "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection." The term "suspicious pattern" is used, but it also states that further verification is needed. Since there's suspicion but no confirmation of malignancy, the answer here isn't clearly "yes" or "no." The options are yes, no, or NA. Since the findings are inconclusive and require consultation, "NA" seems appropriate here because the presence of malignancy isn't definitively confirmed or denied.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA." Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (we put "NA" for the second field), the Gleason grade should also be "NA." Even if there were a mention of Gleason in a suspicious case, without explicit numbers provided, we can't assume. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so "NA" is correct here.

Double-checking each part: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is uncertain (NA), and no Gleason reported (NA). That fits the structured data requirements without nested elements.
