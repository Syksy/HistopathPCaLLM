Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick needle biopsies of the prostate." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Biopsy" seems to fit here, so that's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The required format is major+minor=sum. Here, 4+5=9. Since there's malignancy, we report this as "4+5=9". The other samples don't have significant findings, but the instruction is to take the worst lesion, which is this one.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst Gleason score is included. All values seem to fit the allowed options. No issues spotted here.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
