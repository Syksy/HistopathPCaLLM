Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse that carefully.

First, the task is to fill three fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's start with the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate." Biopsy is the key term here, so the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," which means "Carcinoma is detected in sample B." Karsinooma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The required format is "major+minor=sum." The major pattern is the higher number, so 5 and 4, making 5+4=9. However, the standard notation is major first, which is the higher grade. Wait, Gleason scoring takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. But in the sum, it's primary + secondary = total. However, in the text, it's written as 4+5=9. Wait, the total is 9, which is 4+5. But according to Gleason grading, the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next. But the sum is the two added. However, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. The example given in the text is 4+5=9, so the answer should be "4+5=9". But wait, the user's instruction says "major+minor=sum" where major and minor are integers. So even if the order is 4+5, that's the way it's written in the report. So the answer is "4+5=9".

Other samples show normal structure and no significant inflammation, but since we only consider the worst lesion, this one with Gleason 9 is the one to report. The malignancy is present, so Gleason is not NA.

Double-checking each part. Sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+5=9. All seems correct.
