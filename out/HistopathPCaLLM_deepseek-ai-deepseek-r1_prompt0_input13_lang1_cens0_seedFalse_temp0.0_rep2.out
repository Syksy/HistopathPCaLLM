Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita" which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate." Biopsioita is the plural of biopsy, so the sample type here is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa" – "Carcinoma is detected in sample B." Karsinooma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers if malignant, otherwise NA. The text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The total is 9, with major 4 and minor 5. So it should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions carcinoma in sample B with Gleason 4+5=9, which is the highest mentioned, so that's correct. Other samples are normal, but we only take the worst one.

Double-checking the sample type: "paksuneulabiopsioita" definitely refers to biopsy. Malignancy is present. Gleason score is clearly stated as 4+5=9. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
