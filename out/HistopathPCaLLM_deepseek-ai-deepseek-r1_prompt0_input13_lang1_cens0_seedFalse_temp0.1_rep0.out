Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick needle biopsies of the prostate." Biopsy is the key term here, so the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. Since carcinoma is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The format required is major + minor = sum. Here, 4 and 5 add up to 9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9". The other samples don't have significant findings, but since we're only considering the worst lesion, this is the one to report.

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. Also, confirm that all values are in the allowed formats. No issues spotted here. All fields are properly addressed with the correct values.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "4+5=9"
}
```
