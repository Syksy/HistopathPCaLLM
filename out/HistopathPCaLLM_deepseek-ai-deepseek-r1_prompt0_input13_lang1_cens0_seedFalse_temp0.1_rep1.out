Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate." The Finnish term "biopsioita" clearly indicates biopsy. So the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The format requested is "major+minor=sum" as integers. Here, 4+5=9. Since there's a malignancy, we report this as "4+5=9". If there were no malignancies, it would be NA.

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions that in sample B, the carcinoma is Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples are normal. So the worst is indeed 4+5=9. 

No nested structures allowed in the JSON, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check each field:

1. Alkuperäinen tyyppi: biopsy (correct)
2. Pahanlaatuisia: kyllä (correct)
3. Gleason: 4+5=9 (matches the sum and components)

Everything seems to fit. No issues with the allowed values. The other samples don't affect the worst lesion's data, so they're ignored as per instructions.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
