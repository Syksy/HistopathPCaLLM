Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format. Let me break down each requirement.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita", which translates to "thick needle biopsies of the prostate". Biopsy is the key term here, so the first field should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". So the major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. Since there's a carcinoma, we report this as "4+5=9". If there were no malignancies, it would be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions sample B has the carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and others are normal. So that's the highest grade present. No nested structures in the JSON, just flat keys. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignancy is present. Gleason score correctly parsed. All looks good.

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
