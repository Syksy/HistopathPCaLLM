Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are mentioned as taken from "prostatan tyyppilokaatioista". The term "tyyppilokaatio" might refer to standard biopsy locations. The report doesn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so it's likely a biopsy. So the first answer is "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" and "suspekti patterni", which suggests suspicion of malignancy but isn't confirmed. The user specified to report only confirmed malignancies. Since they need to consult a colleague for confirmation, it's not confirmed yet. The other samples are normal. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed.

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the value should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are top-level. Let me double-check each part. The sample type is correctly biopsy. Malignancy is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Gleason is NA. That seems right.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
