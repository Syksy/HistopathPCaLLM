Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as taken from "prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to standard prostate locations. The report doesn't mention anything about a radical prostatectomy (RP) or transurethral resection (TURP). Since it's just standard biopsies taken from different locations, the type should be "biopsy". But wait, the term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated. However, given that they're taking samples from different parts of the prostate, it's implied to be biopsy samples. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) that requires consultation. The other samples have normal patterns without inflammation. The key here is whether the abnormalities are confirmed as malignant. The report says they need to consult a colleague for confirmation, so it's suspicious but not confirmed. The question is whether to mark this as "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed yet and it's still under consultation, maybe "ei" (no) because it's not definitively stated. But wait, the presence of suspicious patterns might lean towards "kyllä" if we consider that there are findings that could be malignant. However, the instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. Since the other samples are normal, but sample B is suspicious, but not confirmed, perhaps the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the user might want only confirmed cases. Hmm, this is tricky. The original question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's not confirmed, maybe it's "ei" or "NA". But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions suspicious patterns needing consultation, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a finding that's concerning, even if not confirmed. Alternatively, if the presence is only suspected and not confirmed, maybe "ei". But the user might expect that suspicious findings are considered as possible malignant, hence "kyllä". I think I'll go with "kyllä" here, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if it's unclear. Wait, the options are only those three. Let me check the text again. The report says "suspekti patterni" which is suspicious, but they need to consult. So it's not confirmed. Therefore, the presence of malignant findings isn't confirmed, so maybe "ei" (no) because the answer should be based on confirmed results. But the question is phrased as "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If it's not confirmed, then technically, the answer should be "ei" because it's not yet diagnosed as malignant. However, sometimes in medical reports, suspicious findings might be considered as positive until proven otherwise. But according to the strictest interpretation, since it's not confirmed, the answer is "ei". Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the information is insufficient. But the options don't include "NA" for this field. Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if it's uncertain, maybe "NA". But the text does mention suspicious findings, so perhaps the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the user might want only confirmed cases. I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read the instructions. The user says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion's results should be returned). So if the worst lesion is suspicious but not confirmed, how is that handled? If the worst is suspicious, but not confirmed as malignant, then maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "kyllä" because it's the worst finding, even if not confirmed. This is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the correct approach is to mark "kyllä" if there's any suspicion, but according to medical reporting standards, only confirmed malignancies are reported. Since the sample B is under consultation, it's not confirmed, so "ei". But I'm not entirely certain. Let's proceed with "kyllä" because the presence of suspicious patterns might indicate malignancy, even if confirmation is pending. But I might be wrong here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. If the sample is malignant, then the Gleason score is required. But in this case, since the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, and the other samples are normal, the Gleason grade would be "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy. However, if we considered the suspicious lesion as malignant, but the report doesn't mention any Gleason score, then it's still "NA". The text doesn't mention Gleason scores at all, so regardless of malignancy status, if there's no Gleason reported, it's "NA". So the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: "biopsy"
2. Malignant findings: "kyllä" (if suspicious counts) or "ei" (if only confirmed). But given the text says "suspekti" and needs consultation, maybe "kyllä" is too strong. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the presence is suspected but not confirmed, maybe "ei" is incorrect. Alternatively, "NA" is allowed here. Wait, no, the allowed values for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if the presence is uncertain (needs consultation), maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the question is phrased as "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, the answer would be "ei" (no) because malignant findings are not confirmed. Alternatively, "NA" if the information is not available. But the text does mention suspicious findings, so perhaps "kyllä" is intended. However, in medical terms, a suspicious finding isn't the same as a confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. But I'm still a bit torn. Let me check again. The text says "suspekti patterni" which requires consultation. So the presence of malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. Therefore, the answer should be "ei" because there are no confirmed malignant findings, only suspected. So "ei" for question 2.

Wait, but the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (the worst lesion's results). If the worst lesion is the suspicious one, and it's not confirmed, then perhaps the answer is "ei". But if the worst lesion is considered as potentially malignant, then maybe "kyllä". But according to the data, since it's not confirmed, "ei" is safer. So final answers:

1. "biopsy"
2. "ei"
3. "NA"
