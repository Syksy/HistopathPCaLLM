Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as taken from "prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to standard locations of the prostate. The text also mentions "kokonaismäärä näytemateriaalia" (total amount of sample material) being more on the right side. This sounds like a biopsy procedure where multiple samples are taken from different locations. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so the original type is likely "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) needing consultation. However, it's not explicitly stated as malignant. The other samples have normal patterns without inflammation. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, and the user wants "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings), the answer here might be "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed yet. Alternatively, if suspicion implies possible malignancy, but the instructions say to report only confirmed findings. The report says "varmistus tarvitaan" (confirmation needed), so maybe "ei" is safer. But I need to check if "suspekti" counts as malignant. The user might consider "kyllä" if suspicious is considered malignant, but typically in medical terms, suspicion isn't confirmation. So probably "ei" or "NA". Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" is incorrect. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If there's a suspicious finding that's not confirmed, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The user might expect "ei" only if it's explicitly stated there's no malignancy. But here, sample B is suspicious, others are normal. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "ei"? Or "NA"? Hmm. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the suspicious area is not confirmed, then technically, there are no confirmed malignant findings. So "ei" would be correct. But maybe the user expects "kyllä" if there's suspicion. But according to strict interpretation, unless confirmed, it's "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since we determined malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". However, if there's a Gleason mentioned, even in suspicious cases, but in the text there's no mention of Gleason score. The report doesn't state any Gleason grading, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.
