Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." which translates to samples taken from typical prostate locations. The terms used here don't specify the exact procedure like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection (TURP). So, the original type isn't mentioned, so I should put "NA" here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern). However, it also says they need to consult a colleague for confirmation. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, the presence isn't definitively "kyllä" (yes) or "ei" (no). But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspects it. So perhaps "ei" because it's not confirmed yet, but the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "NA" is safer here. Wait, but the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). The worst here is the suspicious one, but since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä"? Hmm, this is tricky. The text says "suspekti patterni" which implies possible malignancy but not certain. The other samples are normal. Since the worst lesion is the suspicious one, but it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "NA" because it's uncertain. Alternatively, maybe "kyllä" because it's suspected. But according to the instructions, if there's a malignancy, report it. Since it's not confirmed, perhaps "ei" is incorrect. Maybe "NA" is better here because the presence isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't definitively state malignancy, just suspicion, "NA" might be appropriate.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (as per previous point), this would be "NA". Even if there's suspicion, without a confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't provided. So "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. Wait, but maybe the sample type is biopsy? The text says "näytteet on otettu" (samples were taken), which could imply biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. The original type isn't specified, so "NA" is correct. The answer would be all NAs. But let me check again.

Sample type: The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So "NA".

Malignancy: The suspicious lesion isn't confirmed, so "NA".

Gleason: Since no malignancy is confirmed, "NA".

Yes, that makes sense. So the JSON should have all three as "NA".

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "NA",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
