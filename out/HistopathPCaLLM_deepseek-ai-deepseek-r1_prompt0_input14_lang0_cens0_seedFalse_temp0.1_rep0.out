Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think "prostatetectomy" might be a typo for "prostatectomy". A prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, which is a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here is likely "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states "tumorous growth" and specifically mentions "carcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". The Gleason score is usually given as the sum of the two most common grades. Here, it's stated as 7, but the breakdown mentions the larger portion being score 3. If the larger portion is 3, then the major pattern is 3, and the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". So the correct entry should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report mentions the tumor reaching near the capsule but no breach, and the highest Gleason is 7, that's the one to report. Also, the structured data shouldn't have nested structures, so the JSON should be flat.

Double-checking for any possible errors. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All values fit the allowed options. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. Malignant is confirmed by carcinoma. Gleason is properly formatted.
