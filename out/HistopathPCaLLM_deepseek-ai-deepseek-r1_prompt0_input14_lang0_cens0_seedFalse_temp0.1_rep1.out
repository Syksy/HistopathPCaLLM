Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." I think that's a typo and should be "prostatectomy." Since a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, the sample type here would be RP. So the first answer should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states "tumorous growth" and specifically mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma." Carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is definitely "yes."

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%." Wait, Gleason scores are typically the sum of the two most common grades. If the larger portion is 3 (which would be the major), then the minor would be 4 because 3 + 4 = 7. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The user specified to take the most severe lesion's results. Since this report mentions only one tumor with Gleason 7, that's the one to use. Also, check if any of the answers might be NA. But in this case, all three fields have clear answers. So the final JSON should have "RP" for sample type, "yes" for malignancy, and "3+4=7" for Gleason grade.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
