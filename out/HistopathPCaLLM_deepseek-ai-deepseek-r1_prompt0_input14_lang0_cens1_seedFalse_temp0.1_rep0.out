Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, the specimen is described as a "comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" prepared in cassettes with batches of samples. There's mention of samples D-G, K-P, etc. The text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. The terms like "surgical margin status" might hint at RP, but it's stated that they can't assess capsule breach or margins from the current material. Since the sample type isn't clearly specified, I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" peripherally and a colleague comparing the patient to someone with Gleason 7. There's a suggestion to rule out mid-grade GG (Gleason grade) findings. The presence of Gleason score discussion implies malignancy, but the text doesn't confirm it outright. It says further investigation is needed. However, since a Gleason score is mentioned (even if from a colleague's comparison), that's a strong indicator of malignancy. So, I'll go with "yes" here, but I need to be cautious. Wait, the actual findings in the current specimen aren't confirmed yet. The colleague's note is about another patient, and they need more sampling. Hmm. The current report doesn't state malignancy definitively. So maybe the answer is "NA" because it's not confirmed yet. But the mention of Gleason 7 in the context of this patient's comparison might suggest that malignancy is suspected. The user instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. If there's a suspicion but not confirmation, should it be "yes" or "NA"? The text says "special patterns of cell growth" which could be malignant, but not definitively stated. Since the Gleason 7 is from a colleague's comparison and not the current sample's finding, maybe the current sample's findings are still uncertain. So perhaps malignant tumor findings are "NA" because it's not confirmed. But I'm a bit torn here. Alternatively, the mention of needing to rule out mid-grade GG (which is part of Gleason scoring) might imply that there's a suspicion of malignancy, hence "yes". But the user instructions say to report based on the most severe lesion. If the current samples have findings that are concerning but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "yes" with a Gleason grade based on the comparison. Wait, the Gleason grade part: the colleague compared to a Gleason 7 patient. But the current report doesn't state the actual Gleason grade. The user wants the reported Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the current sample's Gleason isn't given, but there's a reference to a previous patient's Gleason 7, but the current case needs more sampling. So the Gleason grade here would be "NA" because it's not confirmed in the current specimen. Therefore, for malignant tumor findings, since the Gleason is being considered but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "yes" but the Gleason is "NA". Wait, but the presence of malignant findings would be "yes" if there's any indication, even if not confirmed. Alternatively, if the report is uncertain and requires further investigation, maybe the answer is "NA". This is tricky. Let me re-read the text. The first part mentions "special patterns of cell growth" which could be atypical but not definitively malignant. The colleague's note is about comparing to a Gleason 7 patient, suggesting that there's a suspicion but not confirmation. The text says "to rule out mid-grade GG findings" implying that they haven't found it yet but want to check. So the current report doesn't confirm malignancy, hence malignant tumor findings would be "NA". But the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. If the most severe is suspected but not confirmed, how to handle? Maybe "NA" is safer here. 

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions a colleague's comparison to a Gleason 7 patient, but the current samples haven't confirmed a Gleason score. The report states that further sampling is needed to rule out mid-grade GG. So the actual Gleason isn't reported here, hence "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (not confirmed, needs more investigation)
3. Gleason grade: NA (not reported in current specimen)
