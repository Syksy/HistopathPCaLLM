Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and talks about samples in batches. There's no clear mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" aren't present. So maybe the original sample type isn't specified here. So I'll put NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and a colleague comparing to a "Gleason 7 score patient." Gleason scores are related to cancer grading. However, the report says it's impossible to assess certain factors and that further investigation is needed. There's a mention of ruling out mid-grade GG (Gleason Grade) findings, but no definitive statement of malignancy. So the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed here. The answer might be "no" or "NA." But since there's a suspicion (Gleason 7 is a malignant score), but not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, the instructions say to return results from the most severe lesion. The colleague's note about Gleason 7 suggests a possible malignancy, but the current report hasn't confirmed it yet. The statement says "to rule out mid-grade GG findings" and "further histopathological investigation is warranted." So the current findings don't confirm malignancy. So malignant tumor findings would be "no" or maybe NA. Hmm. The allowed values are yes, no, NA. Since the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, but there's a suspicion, but the actual answer should be based on confirmed findings. Since it's not confirmed, maybe "no" isn't right either. Wait, the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report doesn't confirm it, but mentions a possible Gleason 7, but the current material can't assess, then maybe the answer is NA. Because the presence isn't confirmed yet. So for malignant tumor findings, NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the report mentions a colleague compared to a Gleason 7 patient, but the current findings haven't confirmed a Gleason score. The text says "to rule out mid-grade GG findings" and that further sampling is needed. So the actual reported Gleason grade isn't provided here. Therefore, the answer is NA.

So the structured JSON would be:
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

```json

  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
