Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "kasvainta" (tumor) and "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), which are malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and breaks it down into major and minor components: "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason scores are typically in the format major + minor = sum. Here, the major pattern is 3 (60%), and since the sum is 7, the minor must be 4 (3+4=7). So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion is considered. The report doesn't mention other lesions worse than Gleason 7, so this is the one to report. The other samples (basis and seminal vesicles) are clean, so they don't affect the result.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
