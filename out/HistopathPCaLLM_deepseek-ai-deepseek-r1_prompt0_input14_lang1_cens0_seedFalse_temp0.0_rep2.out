Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is RP, so the first field should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "tuumori" (tumor) and "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), which are malignant. So the second field is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and breaks it down into major (3) and minor components. The major is 3 (60%), minor would be 4 since 3+4=7. The format is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7". 

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The answer should be straightforward JSON with those three keys and values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
