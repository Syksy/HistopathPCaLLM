Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so that's the sample type here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa," which means the tumors are carcinoma (malignant). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major + minor = sum. The text says Gleason 7, with the major component being score 3 (60%). Gleason scores are typically in the format of primary + secondary patterns. If the total is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. Also, since the user specified to take only the worst lesion's results, and the report mentions Gleason 7 as the found tumor, that's the one to use. The other samples like basis and seminaalivehikkelit are clean, so they don't affect the worst case here.

Double-checking the terms: prostatektomia is RP, malignancy is present, Gleason 3+4=7. All looks good. No conflicting information in the text. The answer should be accurate.
