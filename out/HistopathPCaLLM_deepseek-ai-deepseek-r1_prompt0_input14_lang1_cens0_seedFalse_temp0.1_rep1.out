Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so that should be the answer here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa," which means the tumors are cancerous (karsinooma = carcinoma). So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major + minor = sum. The text says "Gleason 7-tasoista" and mentions the larger part (isompi osuus) has a score of 3, about 60%. Gleason scores are typically primary + secondary patterns. If the total is 7, and the major is 3 (60%), then the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only include the worst lesion. The report doesn't mention other lesions, so this should be the correct data.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
