Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so that's the sample type here. So the first field should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report talks about "kasvainta" (tumor) and "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), which are malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the Gleason grade. The text states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and mentions "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason scores are typically in the format of major + minor = sum. Here, the sum is 7. The major component (higher grade) is 4 if the sum is 3+4=7, and minor is 3. But wait, the text says "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3". Wait, that might be confusing. Wait, "scooraus" is likely "score". So the major part is score 3, which is Gleason 3, but that doesn't add up. Wait, Gleason 3+4=7, where major is 4 and minor is 3. But the text says "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Hmm, maybe there's a translation error. Wait, "isompi osuus" means larger portion, which would be the major component. If the major is 3 and minor is 4, that would be 3+4=7, but typically the higher grade is listed first. Wait, but the standard is that the primary pattern (major) is the higher grade. So if the sum is 7, it's either 3+4 or 4+3. The text says "isompi osuus" (larger portion) with score 3, which is 60%. So if the larger part is 3 (60%) and the minor is 4 (40%), then the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But according to Gleason grading, the primary pattern is the most common, but if there's a higher grade even if it's less, it's considered the primary. Wait, no. Wait, the current Gleason system groups grades into Grade Groups. For example, 3+4=7 is Grade Group 2, and 4+3=7 is Grade Group 3. So the way it's reported here is that the major component is 3 (60%) and minor is 4 (40%), making it 3+4=7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7". But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. So the answer here is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." So the Gleason score is 7, which is the sum. The major component (isompi osuus) is score 3 (60%), so the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the correct Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. "RP"
2. "kyllä"
3. "3+4=7"

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions "pahimman leesion" which I assume refers to the highest grade. Since 3+4=7 is mentioned and there's no higher grade elsewhere, this is the correct entry.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
