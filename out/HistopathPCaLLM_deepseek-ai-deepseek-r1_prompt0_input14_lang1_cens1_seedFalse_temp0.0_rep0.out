Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" and "kattavampi näytteenotto tehtäisiin". The terms "näytteet" (samples) and "näytteenotto" (sampling) suggest that this is a biopsy, as it's about taking samples rather than a surgical procedure like RP or TURP. There's no mention of surgery, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) which might be concerning, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. However, there's a reference to a colleague's patient with Gleason 7, suggesting that malignancy is a consideration. But the current report says it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and a more comprehensive sampling is needed to exclude certain findings. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy here, just suspicion, the answer should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm malignancy yet. Alternatively, if "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" is considered potentially malignant, but the key is that the report doesn't confirm it. The user instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. Since the current sample isn't conclusive, and they need more tests, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. The text mentions a colleague's patient had Gleason 7, but that's a previous case. The current case doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score yet because they need more sampling. So the answer here is "NA" because the current sample doesn't report a Gleason grade; it's referencing another case. The actual report doesn't state a Gleason for this patient's sample, so it's NA.
