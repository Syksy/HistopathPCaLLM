Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "kattavasta katsauksesta potilaan prostatakudokseen" which translates to a comprehensive review of the prostate tissue. It mentions being processed into cassettes normally, which is typical for biopsies. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so I think the original type here is biopsy.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) peripherally. However, it also states that it's impossible to assess invasion into the capsule or margins. There's a reference to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current report doesn't confirm malignancy yet. They suggest more sampling to rule out intermediate grade. So, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here. The answer should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the findings are suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, maybe "ei" because the report doesn't state malignancy definitively. Or is NA more appropriate? The instructions say for non-malignant findings, Gleason is NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei" would be correct. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" which could be atypical but not necessarily malignant. So, "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The example given is a previous patient with Gleason 7. The current case suggests more sampling to exclude intermediate grade (GG). However, the current report doesn't assign a Gleason score. So, since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. Even though they mention another patient's Gleason 7, that's not the current case. So, the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: original type is biopsy, malignant findings "ei", Gleason NA.
