Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the report mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" and talks about "kattavampi näytteenotto". The terms like "näytteet" (samples) and "näytteenotto" (sampling) suggest that this might be a biopsy, as they're taking samples from different parts. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) which could be suspicious, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. However, there's a reference to a colleague suggesting a more comprehensive sampling to exclude intermediate grade findings (GG löydökset) and a previous patient with Gleason 7. But the current report doesn't confirm malignancy; it's more about needing further tests. So maybe the presence isn't confirmed here. Wait, but "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be considered as potential malignancy. However, the user wants to know if malignant findings were present. Since the report says it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and they need more tests, maybe the answer is "ei" or NA. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since there's a mention of a previous Gleason 7, but that's from another patient. The current sample's findings are uncertain. So maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed, or NA. Hmm. The question is whether the sample has malignant findings. If the current sample's findings are not confirmed as malignant, and they need more tests, then maybe "ei" or NA. But the presence of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be considered as possible malignancy. But the user says to report only the worst lesion's results. Since the report doesn't explicitly state cancer, but mentions needing further examination, perhaps the answer is "ei" or NA. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there are suspicious findings, maybe the answer is "kyllä"? But the user might want only confirmed malignancies. The text says "On mahdotonta arvioida mahdollista prostatakapselin läpäisyä tai positiviisia/negatiivisia leikkausmarginaaleja nykyisestä materiaalista." So they can't assess invasion or margins, but the presence of malignancy in the sample? The "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be atypical but not definitely malignant. So maybe "ei" or NA. But the user might expect "kyllä" if there's any mention. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The key is whether the sample has malignant findings. The report mentions that a colleague compared this patient to another who had Gleason 7, but that's another patient. The current sample's findings are not conclusive. So perhaps the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed, or NA if the information isn't present. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report doesn't state malignancy definitively, maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the suspicious findings are considered as possible malignancy, but the user wants only confirmed cases, then "ei". Hmm. I think "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, just mentions unusual growths needing further testing.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since in the previous analysis, the presence of malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. However, the text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but that's not the current case. The current case's Gleason isn't reported, so it's NA.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```

**Perustelut:**
1. **Näytteen tyyppi** on "biopsy", koska teksti viittaa useisiin erillisiin näytteisiin (D-G, K-P, O-Q) ja kattavaan näytteenottoon, mikä on tyypillistä koepalanäytteille (biopsia). RP/TURP ei mainita.
2. **Pahanlaatuisuus** on "ei", sillä tekstissä kuvataan ainoastaan "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (epätyypillisiä muutoksia), muttei vahvisteta syöpädiagnoosia. Raportissa korostetaan, että nykyisellä materiaalilla ei voida arvioida kapselin läpäisyä tai marginaaleja, ja lisätutkimuksia tarvitaan.
3. **Gleason-luokka** on "NA", koska tekstissä mainittu Gleason 7 viittaa *toisen potilaan* aiempaan löydökseen, ei nykyisen näytteen tuloksiin. Nykyisestä näytteestä ei raportoida Gleason-asteikkoa.
