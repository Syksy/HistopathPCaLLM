Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as being processed "normaalin rutiinin mukaisesti" and mentions "näytteet D-G... ensimmäisessä kudososassa" which suggests multiple samples taken, possibly via biopsy. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so the type is likely biopsy. If unsure, maybe NA, but the context hints at biopsy.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" which could be translated as unusual growth structures. However, it also states that it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and a more comprehensive sampling is needed to exclude certain findings. The presence of a previous Gleason 7 in a similar patient is noted, but the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here might be "ei" or "kyllä". Wait, "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be suspicious but not definitively malignant. The report suggests further testing, so maybe the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy. So "ei" or maybe NA? But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions needing more tests, perhaps the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed yet. Alternatively, if "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" is considered malignant, but the text says "mahdotonta arvioida", so maybe the presence is uncertain. The correct answer here might be "ei" because the report doesn't state malignancy definitively, but I need to check again. The user says to report only the worst lesion's results. If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, maybe it's still "ei". Alternatively, if the previous patient had Gleason 7, but this one's sample is inconclusive. So the answer for malignancy would be "ei" because the current sample doesn't confirm it, and they need more tests. 

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample's Gleason isn't reported. Since the current sample's malignancy is "ei", the Gleason would be NA. However, if there's a mention of a Gleason score in the report, even if it's from another patient, but the instructions say to report the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason, it's NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: ei
3. Gleason: NA
