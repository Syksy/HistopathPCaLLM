Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as being processed in cassettes as part of routine practice. The terms "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" and mentions of different sections (like K-P, O-Q) suggest multiple samples taken, possibly via biopsy. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the original type is likely a biopsy.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) peripherally. However, it also states that it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and a more comprehensive sampling is needed to exclude certain findings. The presence of growth structures might indicate suspicion, but the report doesn't confirm malignancy. The colleague's previous case had Gleason 7, but this case is still under investigation. So, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here, so the answer might be "ei" or "NA". But wait, "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" could be considered malignant. However, since the report is inconclusive and suggests further testing, maybe it's safer to say "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, maybe "kyllä" if the unusual growth is considered malignant. Hmm. The key is whether the report states malignancy. The text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but this patient's sample isn't confirmed yet. The current report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, just that there are unusual structures. So perhaps the answer here is "ei" or "NA". But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings? If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "ei" because it's not definitive. Alternatively, if the presence of Gleason 7 in a similar patient is mentioned, but that's not the current case. The current case's Gleason isn't reported yet. So the answer here is "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, just suggests further tests.

Third, Gleason grade. The report mentions a colleague's patient had Gleason 7, but the current patient's sample hasn't been graded yet. They suggest more sampling to exclude certain findings. Since the current case doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score, and the previous case is not this one, the Gleason here should be "NA". 

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA
