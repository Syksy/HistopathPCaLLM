Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" and the mention of weight around 5g makes me think of TURP, as TURP specimens are often fragmented and smaller compared to RP, which is the entire prostate. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and more numerous cores. So I'll go with TURP here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the statement says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the two most common grades. Here, the primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the secondary must also be 4 (4+4=8). So the format should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, which in this case is the Gleason 8. All fields are filled, so no NAs here. Let me double-check each part again to be certain. Yep, TURP for sample type, yes for malignancy, and 4+4=8 for Gleason. That should be it.

{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
