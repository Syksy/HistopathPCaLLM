Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "scopic inspection through the shavings." Chippings and shavings make me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is chipped away. Biopsy is usually a needle sample, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the removal of the entire prostate. So TURP seems right here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "confirm adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, it says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." The primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the minor must be 4 as well (4+4=8). The format requested is "major+minor=sum," so "4+4=8."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The text doesn't mention multiple lesions, just that adenocarcinoma is throughout the sample. So the highest Gleason here is 4+4=8. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so straightforward key-value pairs. Allowed values check out: TURP, yes, and 4+4=8. No NAs needed here since all info is present.
