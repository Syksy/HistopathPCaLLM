Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants structured data extracted from a medical text about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "sample material." I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which involves removing tissue from the prostate, often referred to as chippings. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." The standard format is major + minor = sum. If the most represented (major) is 4, then the minor must also be 4 to sum to 8. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered and no nested structures. The JSON should be valid with the three fields. Let me double-check each part to make sure there are no mistakes. Sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 4+4=8. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
