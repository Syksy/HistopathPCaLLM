Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text: "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g..." The term "chippings" and "TURP" are associated. TURP samples are often referred to as chips or chippings. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." The Gleason score is typically major + minor = sum. If the most represented is 4, then major is 4. The sum is 8, so minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the entire sample shows adenocarcinoma with Gleason 8, that's the most severe. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. So the final answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
