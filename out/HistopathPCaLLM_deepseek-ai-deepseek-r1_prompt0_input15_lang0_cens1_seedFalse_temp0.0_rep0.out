Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight." The term "meager weight" might suggest a biopsy, as biopsies typically yield smaller samples compared to RP or TURP. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type. The clinical notes mention suspected adenocarcinoma but no histopathology confirmation yet. Since the sample type isn't clearly stated, maybe the answer here is NA. But wait, the sample is processed, and the term "processed" might be a clue. However, without explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I think the safest answer is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that representative Gleason or other markers couldn't be determined, and the clinical notes mention a suspicion of adenocarcinoma (which is malignant) but it's not confirmed by histopathology yet. The key here is whether there's a confirmed malignancy. Since the report states that the suspicion hasn't been confirmed and needs revision in the next examination, the current findings don't confirm malignancy. So the answer here should be "no" because there's no confirmed malignancy yet. Wait, but the question is "were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report says they couldn't determine it and it's still suspected but not confirmed, then the answer might be "no" because the current findings don't confirm it. Alternatively, if the suspicion is noted but not confirmed, maybe NA? But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer is "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignant finding is "no" here, the Gleason grade should be NA. The text mentions that the clinical notes suspected a Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this wasn't based on histopathology. Since the current examination couldn't determine the Gleason grade, the answer is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since it's not specified)
2. Malignant tumor findings: no (not confirmed)
3. Gleason grade: NA (not determined)
