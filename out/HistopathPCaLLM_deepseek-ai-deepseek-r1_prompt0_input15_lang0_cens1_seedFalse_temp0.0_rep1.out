Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight." The term "meager weight" might suggest a biopsy, as biopsies typically yield smaller amounts of tissue compared to RP or TURP. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type. The clinical notes mention suspected adenocarcinoma but no histopathology confirmation yet. Since the sample type isn't clearly stated, I might have to go with NA here. But wait, the sample is processed with high priority, which is common in biopsies when there's a suspicion. But the report doesn't specify, so maybe NA is safer.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that representative Gleason or other markers couldn't be determined, and there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but no histopathology confirmation yet. The key here is whether there's a confirmed malignancy. Since the report states that the suspicion hasn't been confirmed and needs revision in the next examination, the answer here should be "no" because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Alternatively, if the suspicion is considered a finding, but the instructions say to report only confirmed findings. So "no" because the current findings don't confirm malignancy.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, and the Gleason couldn't be determined, the answer here is NA. The clinical notes mention a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, but that's not based on histopathology. The instructions specify to use the reported Gleason grade from the current findings, which in this case isn't determined yet. So definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA (since not explicitly stated), malignant findings no (since not confirmed), Gleason grade NA.
