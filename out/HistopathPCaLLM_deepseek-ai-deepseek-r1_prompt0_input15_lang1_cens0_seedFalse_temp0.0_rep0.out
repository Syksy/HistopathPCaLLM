Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan höylälastuja". "Höylälastut" translates to "chips" in English, which is typical for a TURP procedure. So the first field should be "TURP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". The primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the minor must also be 4 (4+4=8). However, the standard format is major + minor = sum. Wait, but sometimes in Gleason scoring, if the sum is 8, it could be 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. But the text says the most represented (edustavin) is Gleason 4, so primary is 4 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be straightforward with the three keys. Also, since the malignancy is present, Gleason is required, not NA. Let me double-check the original text for any other details. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason sum is 8 with major and minor both 4. So the final JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
