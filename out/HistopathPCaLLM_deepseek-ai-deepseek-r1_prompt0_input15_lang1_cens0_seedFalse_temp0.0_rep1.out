Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan höylälastuja". "Höylälastut" translates to "chips" in English, which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. So the first field should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". The primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the minor pattern must also be 4 (4+4=8). However, the user specified the format as "major+minor=sum". Wait, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" which might mean the major component is 4, but the sum is 8. So minor would be 4. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The answer should be straightforward JSON with those three fields. Let me double-check each part. Sample type TURP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+4=8. That seems correct.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
