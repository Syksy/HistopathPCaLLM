Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatan höylälastuja," which translates to "prostate chips" or "shavings." TURP procedures typically produce such chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignant findings. The report states "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa," meaning adenocarcinoma was seen in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." The primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the minor must also be 4 (4+4=8). So the format should be "4+4=8."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported and avoid nested structures. All three fields are straightforward here. No ambiguities detected. The answer should be a JSON object with these three key-value pairs.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
