Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan höylälastuja". "Höylälastut" translates to "chips" in English, which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens, as TURP typically produces chip-like tissue fragments. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". This seems a bit confusing. Gleason scoring is usually the sum of the two most common patterns. If the major component is 4 and minor is also 4, the sum would be 4+4=8. However, the wording here says "edustavin Gleason 4" which might mean the major pattern is 4, and the minor could be another pattern. But since the sum is given as 8, it's likely 4+4. So the Gleason score is "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is reported. Since all the samples show adenocarcinoma with Gleason 8, that's the highest. Also, the JSON structure shouldn't have nested elements, just the three keys. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. "Höylälastuja" definitely refers to TURP chips. The malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason sum is explicitly stated as 8. So the structured data should be correct.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
