Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan höylälastuja". "Höylälastut" translates to "chips" in English, which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, I need to check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". Gleason scores are typically given as the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. Here, the primary is 4, and the secondary is also 4, adding up to 8. So the format should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion findings. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 4+4=8. All other details like the patient's history or the amount of sample aren't relevant here. Let me double-check the terms to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. Yes, "höylälastut" is TURP, adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy, and the Gleason sum is clearly stated. Looks solid.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
