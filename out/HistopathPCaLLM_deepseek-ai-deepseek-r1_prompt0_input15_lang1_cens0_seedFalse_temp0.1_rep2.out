Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

The sample text is in Finnish, so I need to make sure I understand the medical terms correctly. The first part mentions "prostatan höylälastuja," which translates to "prostate chips" or "prostate shavings." I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often results in such chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP. The options are biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So the first answer should be "TURP."

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa," which means "adenocarcinoma is seen in almost all." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so the presence is confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA." So the second answer is "kyllä."

For the Gleason score, the text says "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." Gleason grading typically sums the primary and secondary patterns. Here, the primary is 4, and the secondary is also 4 (since 4+4=8). The required format is "major+minor=sum," so it should be "4+4=8." The user specified to report the worst lesion's results, and since this is the only Gleason mentioned, that's the one to use. If there were multiple scores, we'd pick the highest, but here it's straightforward.

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is a top-level key. Also, check that the values are exactly as per the allowed options. No typos, correct syntax. Let me double-check each part:

1. Sample type: TURP is correct because the text refers to höylälastuja (chips from TURP).
2. Malignancy: "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma is malignant.
3. Gleason: "4+4=8" as stated. If there were benign findings, it would be NA, but here it's malignant, so this applies.

Everything seems to fit. The JSON structure should be simple with these three keys and the determined values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
