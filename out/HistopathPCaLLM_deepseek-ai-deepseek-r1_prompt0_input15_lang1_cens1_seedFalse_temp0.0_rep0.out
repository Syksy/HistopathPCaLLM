Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the original sample is described as "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which translates to prostate tissue material. The report mentions "skooppitutkimus" which I think refers to a scope examination, possibly a biopsy. But there's no explicit mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). However, since it's a biopsy taken for initial examination, maybe the type is "biopsy". But wait, the text says "Alustavasti skooppitutkimuksessa" which might mean initial scope examination, but I'm not entirely sure. If there's uncertainty, maybe it's safer to put "NA". But I need to check if "skooppitutkimus" is a term used for biopsy. Alternatively, if the sample is from a TURP procedure, but the text doesn't mention that. Hmm. The user might expect "biopsy" here, but since the term isn't explicit, maybe "NA" is better. Wait, the text says "kliiniset muistiinpanot mainitsivat epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta" which suggests that a biopsy was taken to check for cancer. So maybe "biopsy" is correct. I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" meaning they can't confirm malignancy markers yet. Also, "kliiniset muistiinpanot mainitsivat epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta" which is a suspicion but not confirmed. The potential findings need to be re-examined. So the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the answer should be "ei" (no), but wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the report says they can't confirm Gleason or other markers, and the suspicion is based on clinical notes, not histopathology, the actual sample doesn't show malignancy. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed here (answer to 2 is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The text mentions that clinical notes suspected something like Gleason sum 8 / ISUP GG4, but this wasn't based on histopathology. So the actual sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score. Hence, "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type "biopsy", malignancy "ei", Gleason "NA".
