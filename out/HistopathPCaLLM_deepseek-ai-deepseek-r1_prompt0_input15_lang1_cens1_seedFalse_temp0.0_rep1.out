Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the terms used are "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" (prostate tissue material) and mentions of "skooppitutkimus" which translates to a scopy or biopsy. The report doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP, so the original type is likely a biopsy. But wait, the text says "Alustavasti skooppitutkimuksessa" which might mean initial scopy or biopsy. However, sometimes "skooppi" can refer to a TURP procedure. Hmm, but TURP is usually for removing tissue when there's an obstruction, and the text mentions "kliiniset symptomit" (clinical symptoms) that could be due to histopathology. Since it's not explicitly stated as TURP or RP, and the sample is described as "varsin niukka" (quite scant), which is more typical of a biopsy, I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The text mentions that there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but it says "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" (representative Gleason or other markers cannot be confirmed at this point). Also, it states that potential findings need to be re-examined in the next session. Since the histopathology hasn't confirmed malignancy yet, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't show malignant findings, only suspicion from clinical notes which isn't confirmed histopathologically.

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". However, since the report says that a representative Gleason can't be confirmed and the suspicion of Gleason 8 is based on clinical notes, not histopathology, the current sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score. Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to field 2 is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together:
1. Original type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: ei
3. Gleason: NA
