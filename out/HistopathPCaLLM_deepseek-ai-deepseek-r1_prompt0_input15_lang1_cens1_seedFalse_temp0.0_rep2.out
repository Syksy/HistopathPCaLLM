Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the report mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka" which translates to the total amount of prostate tissue being quite scarce. This scarcity is more typical of a biopsy sample rather than RP or TURP, which usually yield more tissue. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP procedures. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says that the clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma, but it clarifies that this wasn't based on histopathology. Phrases like "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" indicate that no malignancy was confirmed in the current sample. The potential findings need to be re-examined in another session. Since the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions that the clinical notes suspected something like Gleason sum 8 / ISUP GG 4 or higher, but this wasn't based on histopathology. Since the current histopathology doesn't confirm any malignancy, there's no Gleason score to report here. So the third field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the worst lesion's results are included. Since no malignancy is found, Gleason is NA. All fields seem to fit the allowed values. Let's put it all together.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
