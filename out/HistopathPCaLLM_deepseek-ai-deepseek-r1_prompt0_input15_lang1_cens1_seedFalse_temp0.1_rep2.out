Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the original sample is described as "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka..." which translates to the prostate tissue sample being quite scant. The terms used here don't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the sample is just referred to as prostate tissue without specifying the procedure, I think the correct answer here is "NA" because none of the allowed types are clearly stated.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions that the clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma, but it also states that no representative Gleason or other markers could be confirmed at this point. The key here is that the histopathology hasn't confirmed malignancy yet; it's just a suspicion. The report says potential findings need to be re-examined in the next session. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer should be "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't show malignant findings, only suspicion which isn't confirmed.

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions clinical notes suspecting a Gleason sum of 8 corresponding to ISUP GG 4 or higher, but it explicitly states this isn't based on histopathology. Since the Gleason score here is from clinical suspicion and not the actual histopathological findings, and the sample hasn't confirmed malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". Even though there's a mention of Gleason 8, it's not from the histopathology report itself, so we can't include it.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with quotes and commas in the right places. Also, check that there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason remains NA as per the instructions.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita eksplisiittisesti tekstissä (ei viitata biopsy, RP, TURP), joten arvo "NA".
2. Histopatologisessa tutkimuksessa ei vahvistettu adenokarsinoomaa/maligniteettiä (mainitaan epäilyn olemassaolo, mutta ei vahvistusta). Pahanlaatuisuusarvio perustuu kliinisiin epäilyihin, joita ei vielä pystytty vahvistamaan.
3. Gleason-summaa/ISUP-luokitusta ei raportoida histopatologisesti (viitataan kliinisiin spekulaatioihin Gleason 8:sta, mutta nämä eivät perustu kudosnäytteeseen). Hyvänlaatuisuuden vuoksi arvo "NA".
