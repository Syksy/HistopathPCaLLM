Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The inspected material consists of three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The key term here is "fusion biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "carcinoma focuses," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states, "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Gleason score is determined by the most prevalent grade (major) plus the next most prevalent (minor). Here, architecture 3 is 2/3 and 4 is 1/3. So major is 4 and minor is 3, but wait, no—wait, the major component is the higher grade if they are different. Wait, no, the Gleason score is the most common pattern (major) and the highest remaining pattern (minor). Wait, actually, the current grading system (since 2016) uses the most common and the highest grade present. So if the majority is grade 3 but there's grade 4 present, the score would be 3 + 4 = 7. But in the text, it says "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4... spanning less than one third." Then in the conclusion, architecture 3 covers 2/3 and 4 covers 1/3. So the major is 3 (since it's the most extensive) and the minor is 4 (the highest remaining). So the Gleason grade should be 3+4=7. But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So the answer here is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions multiple carcinoma focuses but the conclusion refers to the score 7 from the 15mm length, which is the most severe part. So that's the one to report.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the allowed values and formatting. JSON structure without nesting. Looks good.
