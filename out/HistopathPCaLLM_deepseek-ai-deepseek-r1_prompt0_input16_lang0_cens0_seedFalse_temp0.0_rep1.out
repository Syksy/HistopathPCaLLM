Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it starts with "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The term "fusion biopsies" clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. So the first answer should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "carcinoma focuses," which are malignant. So the answer here is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Gleason score is determined by the two most prevalent grades. Here, the major component is grade 3 (covering 2/3) and minor is grade 4 (1/3). So the Gleason grade should be 3+4=7. Even though the report mentions some Gleason 4 structures, the conclusion clearly states the score as 7 with 3 and 4 components. So the answer is "3+4=7."

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the conclusion directly states the score 7, that's the one to use. Also, the JSON should not have nested structures. Let me double-check the allowed values and formatting. All entries look correct. No NA needed here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```
