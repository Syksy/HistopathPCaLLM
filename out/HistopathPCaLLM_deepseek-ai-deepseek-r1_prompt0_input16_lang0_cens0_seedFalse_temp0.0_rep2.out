Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The inspected material consists of three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The key term here is "fusion biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "carcinoma focuses," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states, "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Gleason score is determined by the most prevalent grade (major) and the next most prevalent (minor). Here, architecture 3 is 2/3 (major) and 4 is 1/3 (minor), so the score is 3+4=7. The correct format would be "3+4=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report mentions Gleason 4 components but the majority is Gleason 3, the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. The highest grade here is 3+4=7, which is the correct score.

Finally, structuring this into JSON without nested structures. The fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the allowed values and the extracted data to confirm accuracy.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
