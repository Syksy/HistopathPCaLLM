Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The inspected material consists of three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The key term here is "fusion biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The statement mentions "carcinoma focuses," which are malignant. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report says "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." The primary grade (major) is 3 and the secondary (minor) is 4, summing to 7. The correct format is "3+4=7."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the highest Gleason mentioned is 3+4=7, that's the one to report. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. So the final answer should be straightforward with these three fields.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```
