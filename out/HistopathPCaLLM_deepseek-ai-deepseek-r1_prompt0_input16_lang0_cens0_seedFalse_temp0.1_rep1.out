Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Biopsy is one of the allowed values, so that's straightforward. Answer for field 1 should be "biopsy."

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says "approximately half contains carcinoma focuses." Carcinoma indicates malignancy, so the answer here is "yes" for field 2.

Now, the Gleason grade. The report mentions "Gleason 4 -type" structures in some areas, but the conclusion states "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." Gleason scores are typically major + minor grades. Here, major is 3 (covering 2/3) and minor is 4 (1/3), but wait, usually the higher grade is the major. Wait, maybe I got that reversed. If the majority is grade 3 and the minor is grade 4, the score would be 3 + 4 = 7. But the way it's written, "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3," so major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7". The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. So that's correct. But the allowed values prefer "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So the answer is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements." So "3+4=7" is correct. The example in the instructions shows "major+minor=sum" like "4+3=7". So the answer here is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in JSON. So the JSON should have these three keys with the corresponding values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
