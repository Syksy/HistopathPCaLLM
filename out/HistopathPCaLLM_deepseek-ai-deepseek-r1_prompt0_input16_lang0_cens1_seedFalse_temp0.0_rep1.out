Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The term "suspicious foci" might suggest a biopsy, but the text doesn't explicitly state the sample type. It just refers to "sample material" without specifying the procedure. So I think the answer here is NA because there's no clear indication of biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "suspicious foci" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation," which could imply malignancy. However, it also states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. The conclusion is that manual grading is needed. Since the report is uncertain and doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be NA. They can't confirm malignancy without manual review, so it's not a clear yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text mentions mid-grade possibilities like 3+4 or 4+3 but says they can't reliably assess due to digitalization issues. Since the grading isn't confirmed and needs manual review, there's no explicit Gleason score provided. So the answer here is NA as well.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no confirmed malignancy, all fields default to NA.
