Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "the inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The terms "inspected material" and "suspicious foci" suggest that this is a biopsy, as biopsies are taken to examine suspicious areas. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with biopsy.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "multiple suspicious foci" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation," which implies that there are malignant cells, but the report is inconclusive due to resolution issues. However, the conclusion suggests that manual grading is needed, which is typically done when malignancy is suspected. So even though the digital assessment is inconclusive, the presence of suspicious foci and the need for further manual checks might indicate that malignancy is present. But wait, the statement doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. It says "suspicious" but doesn't state malignancy definitively. The answer here might be "no" because the report is inconclusive, or "NA" if the information isn't clear. Alternatively, since they are suspicious and need manual grading, maybe it's "yes" but uncertain. Hmm, tricky. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but raises suspicion, maybe the answer is "NA" because it's not definitively stated. But the user says to return the most severe lesion's results. If the suspicious foci are considered potentially malignant, but not confirmed, maybe "NA" is safer. Alternatively, the presence of "various grades of cell differentiation" might imply malignancy, as benign cells wouldn't have different grades. So perhaps "yes" is correct. I need to think. Gleason grading applies to malignant tumors. The text mentions that grading is inconclusive due to resolution, but the need to grade suggests malignancy is present. So maybe the answer is "yes" for malignant findings, even if the exact grade isn't determined. So I'll go with "yes" for question 2.

Third, the reported Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the statement says assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and mentions that mid-grade (3+4 or 4+3) would be hard to assess, but doesn't provide a specific grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade isn't reported here. So the answer should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings yes, Gleason grade NA. But wait, the user said to take the most severe lesion. If the Gleason can't be assessed, but malignancy is present, then Gleason is NA. So the JSON should be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

But I need to double-check. The original sample type: the statement doesn't explicitly say biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says "inspected material" from the prostate. Biopsy is the most likely, but if unsure, maybe NA? However, "multiple suspicious foci" is typical for biopsy samples. RP and TURP are specific procedures. Since the sample is taken from the prostate without specifying the procedure, but "suspicious foci" suggests biopsy. So biopsy is correct.

Malignant tumor: the text says "suspicious foci" and discusses grading, which is part of cancer assessment. So even though inconclusive, the presence of suspicious foci that require manual grading for Gleason suggests malignancy is present. Hence "yes".

Gleason grade: since they couldn't assign scores due to resolution, it's NA.
