Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "the inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The terms "inspected material" and "suspicious foci" suggest that this is a biopsy sample, as biopsies are taken to examine suspicious areas. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy" here.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that "about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns that were closely inspected." They observed "various grades of cell differentiation," but couldn't assign explicit scores due to resolution issues. The conclusion mentions that grading should be done manually because mid-grade differentiations (like 3+4 or 4+3) are hard to assess digitally. The presence of different grades suggests malignancy, but the report is inconclusive. However, the mention of "suspicious foci" and the need for further manual grading implies that malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. Since the question is about whether there were malignant findings, and the report is inconclusive, maybe the answer is "NA" because it's not definitively yes or no. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy, but the suspicious foci and the discussion of Gleason grades (which are for cancer) might imply malignancy. However, the report is inconclusive. The user instruction says to return "NA" for benign, but if it's uncertain, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. Alternatively, since they mention mid-grade differentiations (which are cancer grades), maybe it's considered malignant. Hmm, tricky. The key is whether there's a definite malignant finding. The text says "suspicious foci" and that grading is needed. So maybe the presence of malignant tumor is not confirmed here, hence "NA" or "yes"? Wait, the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report is inconclusive but mentions suspicious areas needing further testing, does that count as "yes" or "no"? The answer might be "yes" because they are considering Gleason grades, which are for cancer. But the report says assigning scores is inconclusive. Maybe the answer is "yes" because they are discussing grading, which implies malignancy exists. Alternatively, if the malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe "NA". But the allowed values don't have an uncertain option. The user instructions say "NA" for benign. Wait, the third question's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant or "NA" for benign. So if the answer to question 2 is "yes", then the third should have a Gleason grade. If "no" or "NA", then third is "NA". In this case, the text mentions that grading is needed but can't be done due to resolution. So maybe the presence of malignant tumor is "yes" because they are trying to grade it, but the grade itself is "NA". So for question 2, answer "yes", and question 3 "NA". But the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Wait, the statement says "about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns" which were inspected. They observed various grades but couldn't assign scores. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually. The mention of mid-grade (3+4 or 4+3) suggests that there's a possibility of such grades, but they can't confirm. So the presence of malignant tumor is indicated (since they are discussing Gleason grades), hence "yes" for question 2. But the Gleason grade can't be determined here, so question 3 is "NA".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor findings: yes
3. Gleason grade: NA

Wait, but the user instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci" and "various grades of cell differentiation". The most severe lesion would be the highest grade, but since they can't assign scores, maybe the answer is still "NA" for Gleason. So the structured data would be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
