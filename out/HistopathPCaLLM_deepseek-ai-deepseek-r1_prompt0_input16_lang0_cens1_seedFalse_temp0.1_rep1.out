Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "the inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." There's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I might have to go with NA here since it's not specified.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The text says "suspicious foci" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation," but it also states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive. The conclusion suggests that grading needs to be done manually. The term "suspicious" might indicate malignancy, but it's not definitive. However, since they're considering grading (which relates to malignancy), maybe the answer is "yes." But the uncertainty here is tricky. Alternatively, if it's inconclusive, maybe "NA" is safer. But the presence of suspicious foci usually leans towards malignancy, so "yes" might be appropriate.

Third, the Gleason grade. The example format is "major+minor=sum." The text mentions that mid-grade like 3+4 or 4+3 is hard to assess due to digitalization issues. However, they didn't assign a score because of resolution problems. So the Gleason grade isn't provided here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" since they couldn't determine it from the digital images and recommend manual grading.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant yes (because of suspicious foci needing further grading), Gleason NA. Wait, but the user says to take the most severe lesion. If the sample is suspicious but not confirmed, maybe malignant is "NA"? Hmm. The statement says "suspicious foci" which are being considered for grading. Suspicious in medical terms often implies concern for malignancy, but without confirmation. However, the task says "malignant tumor findings" – if they found malignant cells, it's yes. If uncertain, maybe NA. The text doesn't confirm malignancy, just that they need to grade it. So maybe "NA" for malignant as well? But the presence of suspicious foci might be considered as a malignant finding. This is a bit ambiguous. The user's instructions say "malignant tumor findings" allowed values yes, no, NA. Since the report is about suspicious lesions that require manual grading, but doesn't explicitly state malignancy, perhaps the answer is "NA" for malignant. Alternatively, if suspicious implies malignancy, then "yes." But I think in medical terms, suspicious doesn't equate to confirmed malignancy. So maybe "NA" is safer here. But I need to check the exact wording. The original text says "suspicious foci from the prostate" and "various grades of cell differentiation." Grades of cell differentiation are typically discussed in the context of malignancy. So if they're grading, that implies malignancy. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings would be "yes." Even though the exact grade isn't determined, the fact that grading is needed suggests malignancy. So "yes" for malignant. Then Gleason is "NA" because they couldn't assign a score due to resolution issues. Original sample type is NA because it's not specified. So the final JSON would be sampleType: NA, malignant: yes, gleason: NA.
