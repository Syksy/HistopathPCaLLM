Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The terms "suspicious foci" and the context of digital histopathology suggest this is a biopsy, as biopsies are often taken from suspicious areas. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy."

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "suspicious foci" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation," which implies malignancy is suspected. However, the conclusion states that grading needs to be done manually due to resolution issues. Since they can't confirm the grade but there's suspicion, does that mean malignancy is present? The answer isn't explicit. The report doesn't confirm malignancy but doesn't rule it out either. The user might expect "NA" here because the malignancy isn't definitively confirmed. But the presence of suspicious foci might lean towards "yes." Hmm. The key is whether malignant findings are confirmed. Since the report is inconclusive and requires manual grading, maybe "NA" is safer. But the mention of "suspicious" could imply malignancy. I'm a bit torn here. Let me check again. The statement says "various grades of cell differentiation are observed," which are part of Gleason grading, but they can't assign scores due to resolution. So there's evidence of tumor, but the grading is inconclusive. So malignant tumor findings would be "yes" because they observed tumor cells, even if grading isn't possible. But the user's allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the presence of tumor is confirmed, it's yes. If uncertain, maybe NA. The text doesn't explicitly say "malignant," but suspicious foci and cell differentiation grades suggest malignancy. However, without explicit confirmation, maybe "NA" is better. Wait, the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report is uncertain, maybe it's NA. But the presence of suspicious foci and the need for manual grading might imply that malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. So perhaps "NA" is appropriate here. Alternatively, if the presence of tumor is confirmed but the grade isn't, then malignant would be "yes." The answer depends on whether the existence of the tumor is confirmed. The statement says "suspicious foci," which are areas that might be cancerous. Since they can't assign grades due to resolution, but the foci are suspicious, does that count as malignant? Maybe not definitively. So "NA" for malignant findings.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA." The text says assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution. They mention that mid-grade (3+4 or 4+3) would be hard to assess. Since they can't assign a grade, the Gleason grade should be "NA."

So putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. But wait, the sample type: the statement doesn't explicitly say biopsy. It says "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." Biopsy is a way to get foci, but could it be from TURP or RP? Without specific mention, maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, the user allows "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." The statement doesn't specify the procedure. The term "inspected material" could be from any of these. Since it's not stated, maybe the original sample type is NA. But "suspicious foci" are typically biopsied. However, without explicit mention, perhaps NA is better. Hmm. The user's examples might expect biopsy if it's multiple foci, but if the procedure isn't named, NA. So original sample type: NA. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The first sentence: "The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." In clinical terms, when they take multiple suspicious foci, that's usually a biopsy. RP is the entire prostate, TURP is for removing tissue from the prostate, often in cases of BPH. But the description here is about multiple foci, which is more like a biopsy. So I think original sample type is biopsy. So sample type: biopsy. Malignant: NA (since not confirmed, just suspicious). Gleason: NA.
