Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So here, the original type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text refers to "karsinoomafokuksia", which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This translates to a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The example given in the problem uses "3+4=7", which matches this case. The answer should be straightforward here. All three fields are covered accurately based on the provided text.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
