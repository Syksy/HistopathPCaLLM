Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So here, the original type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text has words like "karsinoomafokuksia" (carcinoma foci) and "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" (malignant findings). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "score 7 yhteensä" which refers to Gleason score 7. The required format is "major+minor=sum". The details mention "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So major pattern is 4 (since it's the higher grade) and minor is 3. Wait, but Gleason scoring takes the most prevalent pattern as the first number. Wait, no, the primary grade is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. But in the example given, the majority (2/3) is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta". So the primary grade is 3 (since it's 2/3 of the carcinoma part) and secondary is 4. But Gleason score is primary + secondary, so 3+4=7. However, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". But in Gleason grading, the major is the higher grade if one is higher. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, secondary is the next most common. So if the majority is 3 and secondary is 4, the score is 3+4=7. But sometimes, when there's a higher grade even if it's less, it's considered. Wait, but according to current guidelines, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. So in this case, since 2/3 is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so Gleason score 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). The report mentions three biopsies with carcinoma foci. The largest is 7mm, 6mm, 2mm. The worst would be the one with Gleason 3 and 4. The summary says "score 7 yhteensä 15mm", with 3 being 2/3 and 4 being 1/3. So the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".
