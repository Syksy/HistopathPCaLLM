Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsiaa" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "karsinoomafokuksia", which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This translates to a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. The major pattern is 3 (since it's 2/3 of the carcinoma part) and minor is 4 (1/3). Wait, but Gleason scoring takes the most predominant pattern as the first number and the next most as the second. However, in some cases, if the higher grade is more than 5% but less than the primary, it's the minor. Here, the major is 3 (2/3) and minor is 4 (1/3), so the sum is 3+4=7. So the format should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions three foci with lengths 7, 6, and 2mm. The summary says a total of 15mm with Gleason 7. Since the highest score here is 7, that's the one to report.

No nested structures allowed, so each answer is a direct value. All required fields are addressed. Let's put it all together in JSON.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
