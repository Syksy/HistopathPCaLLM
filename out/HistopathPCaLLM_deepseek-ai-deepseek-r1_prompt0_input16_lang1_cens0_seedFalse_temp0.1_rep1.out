Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse that carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go step by step.

1. **Sample type**: The report mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So here, the original type should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The text talks about "karsinoomafokuksia", which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

3. **Gleason grade**: The key part is "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". Gleason score is the sum of the major and minor patterns. Here, major is 4 (since it's the higher grade) and minor is 3. So the sum is 3+4=7. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7".

Wait, but the example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum". The user specified that for malignant cases, it's in that format. Since this is malignant, we need to check which is the major and minor. The text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So grade 3 is 2/3 (majority) and grade 4 is 1/3 (minority). Wait, no, actually, the majority is grade 3 here. But in Gleason scoring, the higher grade is listed as the major even if it's less in quantity. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up. Wait, Gleason score is determined by the primary (most prevalent) grade and the secondary (next most prevalent) grade. But if the secondary is higher, does it become the major? No, the primary is the most common, secondary is the next. However, if a higher grade is present, even if it's less than the lower grade, the Gleason score is the higher grade plus the lower. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is the sum of the most common (primary) and the second most common (secondary) patterns. However, if there's a small amount of a higher grade, sometimes it's considered tertiary and not included. But in this case, the report says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So grade 3 is 2/3 (66.6%) and grade 4 is 1/3 (33.3%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher grade? Or the most prevalent? I think in current Gleason grading, the primary pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next, even if lower. But in cases where a higher grade is present but less in quantity, sometimes it's considered. Wait, but according to the latest guidelines, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and the secondary (second most extensive) grades. However, if the highest grade is present, even if it's less than 5% in biopsy, it's included. Wait, maybe I need to check. For example, if the majority is grade 3 and a smaller part is grade 4, the score is 3+4=7. If the majority is grade 4 and a smaller part is grade 3, it's 4+3=7. The order matters. In this case, the report states that grade 3 is 2/3 (majority) and grade 4 is 1/3. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7, so the format should be "3+4=7". But the user's example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum", but I need to confirm if major refers to the higher grade or the primary (most prevalent). This is crucial. For example, in some contexts, the major is the higher grade, but in standard Gleason scoring, it's primary (most prevalent) + secondary (second most prevalent). So in this case, 3 is primary, 4 is secondary, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example might have a different scenario. Let me make sure. The user's instructions say: "major+minor=sum" where major and minor are integers. So perhaps in their system, major is the higher grade and minor is the lower. But that's not how Gleason works. Wait, no. The standard Gleason score is primary (most common) + secondary (second most common). However, if there's a tertiary pattern (third most common), it's sometimes noted. But in this case, the report mentions only grades 3 and 4. So primary is 3 (2/3), secondary is 4 (1/3). Therefore, the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

But I need to check if the user's intended format is major as the higher grade. For example, if the higher grade is considered major regardless of its proportion. But according to current medical standards, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. So even if a higher grade is present but less extensive, it's the secondary. So in this case, 3 is primary, 4 is secondary. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer is "3+4=7".
