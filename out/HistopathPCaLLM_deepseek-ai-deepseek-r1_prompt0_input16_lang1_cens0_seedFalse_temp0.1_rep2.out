Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsiaa" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So the original type here is "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "karsinoomafokuksia", which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers if malignant, otherwise "NA". The report states "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This translates to a Gleason score of 7, with grade 3 being about two-thirds and grade 4 one-third. In Gleason scoring, the major (primary) pattern is the higher grade. However, if the highest grade is present in a smaller proportion, the major is still the higher grade. Wait, but here grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3. Wait, no—Gleason score is determined by adding the most prevalent grade (major) and the next most prevalent (minor), but if there's a higher grade present, even if less, it's included. Wait, no. The Gleason score is the sum of the most common grade and the highest grade present. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the rules. Let me recall: For Gleason scoring in biopsies, the primary grade is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. If there are only two patterns, the primary is the higher one if they are different. Wait, no. For example, if a tumor has 60% pattern 3 and 40% pattern 4, the Gleason score would be 3 + 4 = 7. The primary is the most common (pattern 3), secondary is the next (pattern 4). But if there's a tertiary pattern, which is higher, like pattern 5, that might be noted but not included in the score. In this case, the text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So 2/3 is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4. Therefore, the primary is grade 3 (most extensive), secondary is grade 4. So the Gleason score is 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the format should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instructions say to report the major and minor as the sum. So the answer should be "3+4=7". Let me confirm. The text says "score 7", which aligns with that. So the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions three foci, but the summary gives the total score as 7, which is the highest (since Gleason 7 is worse than lower scores). So that's the correct one to report.
