Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the original sample is described as "useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa" which translates to multiple suspicious foci in the prostate. The terms "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection) aren't explicitly mentioned. The text talks about digital histopathology and mentions that the sample should be graded manually before digitization. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which refers to varying degrees of cell differentiation. However, it also states that a precise score couldn't be classified due to resolution issues in digital images. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually. The presence of different grades suggests there might be malignancy, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm it. Since the exact determination is hindered by technical issues, maybe the answer here is "NA" as well. Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. The text doesn't clearly state malignancy, just that grading is difficult. So perhaps the presence of malignancy is uncertain, hence "NA".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain (we put "NA" in the second field), the Gleason grade would also be "NA". However, the text does mention examples like 3+4 or 4+3, but these are hypothetical scenarios explaining why manual grading is needed. The actual report doesn't provide a specific Gleason score for the sample. So "NA" is correct here.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. But wait, the user said to take the worst lesion's results. If there are varying grades but no confirmation, maybe malignancy is present? Let me re-read. The text says "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which implies different grades, possibly malignant. But the report can't confirm due to resolution. So maybe malignancy is present ("kyllä"), but the grade can't be determined. But the user instructions say to report the Gleason only if malignant. If malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason would be "NA" because it's not specified. Alternatively, if malignancy is "NA", then Gleason is "NA". Hmm. The key is whether the presence of malignant findings is confirmed. The text doesn't explicitly say "malignant" or "cancer", just discusses grading issues. So perhaps the answer for malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain. Therefore, all three fields would be "NA". But I need to be careful. The user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If there are varying grades, even if not confirmed, maybe the worst is considered. But without a confirmed malignancy, maybe it's still "NA". I think the safest answer here is all NAs.
