Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa" which translates to multiple suspicious foci in the prostate. The terms used here don't mention RP or TURP, which are specific procedures. Since it's talking about taking samples from suspicious areas, this sounds more like a biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which indicates varying degrees of cell differentiation. However, it also states that the exact score can't be classified due to resolution issues in digital images. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually. The presence of grading discussions suggests there's some malignancy, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm cancer. The key here is whether the findings are malignant. Since they mention grading (which is for cancer) but can't determine the exact score due to technical issues, it's implied that there are malignant cells, but maybe not definitively confirmed. Wait, the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). The text says they can't assign a score because of resolution problems, but they do mention varying differentiation grades. Differentiation grades are part of cancer grading, so even if the exact Gleason score isn't determined, the presence of different grades suggests malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. The text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but says that determining the exact score is difficult due to digitalization issues. Since they can't assign a specific score, even though they mention possible grades, the actual reported Gleason isn't provided. Therefore, the answer here should be "NA" because the exact score isn't determined and the presence of malignancy is implied but not confirmed with a specific grade. Wait, but the user instructions say for malignant findings, the Gleason should be in the sum format, and NA only for benign. Since we answered "kyllä" for malignancy, but the report can't assign a score, maybe the Gleason is still NA. But the problem is that the user specified "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). However, in this case, even the worst lesion's Gleason isn't determined. So the correct value here is NA because it's not reported, despite malignancy being present. The examples given (3+4, 4+3) are hypotheticals, not actual reported scores. So the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: biopsy for sample type, yes for malignancy, and NA for Gleason.
