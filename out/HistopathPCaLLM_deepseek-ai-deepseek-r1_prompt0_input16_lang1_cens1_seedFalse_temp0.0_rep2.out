Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "suspektista fokuksesta" suggests that they took samples from suspicious foci, which is typical for a biopsy. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I think the original sample type here is a biopsy. So the first field would be "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "näisä havaittiin vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja". The presence of varying differentiation grades (erilaistumisgradeja) indicates that there are some abnormal cells, which are likely malignant. However, the report also mentions that the exact score couldn't be classified due to resolution issues in the digital images. But the key point is that there were findings that suggest malignancy, even if grading was difficult. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text explicitly states examples like 3+4 or 4+3, but says that grading was not possible due to the digitalization mistake. Since the exact score couldn't be determined, even though there's a mention of possible grades, the actual reported Gleason isn't provided. The conclusion is that the grading needs to be done manually, so the structured data should have "NA" here. Even though malignancy is present, the Gleason score wasn't finalized, so we can't report a numerical value.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is present, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results. The answer should be straightforward.
