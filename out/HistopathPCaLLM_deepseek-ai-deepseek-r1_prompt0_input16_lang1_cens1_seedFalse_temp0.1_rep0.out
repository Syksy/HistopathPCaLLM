Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa" which translates to multiple suspicious foci in the prostate. This sounds like a biopsy since they're taking samples from suspicious areas, but the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the original type isn't specified here. Therefore, I should go with NA for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which indicates varying degrees of cell differentiation. However, it also states that the exact score can't be classified due to resolution issues in digital images. The conclusion recommends regrading manually. The presence of grading discussions (like Gleason scores 3+4 or 4+3) suggests there might be malignancy, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm it. Since the exact determination isn't possible here, maybe the answer is NA. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. The text says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). The report mentions that grading needs to be done manually, implying that there might be something there, but it's unclear. However, the user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion and if malignancy is present. Since they are discussing Gleason scores (which are for cancer), it's likely that malignancy is present. But the report doesn't clearly state "malignant" or "carcinoma". Hmm, this is tricky. The key phrase is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the question. The text says "havaittiin vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which are grades of differentiation, which in cancer terms, refers to malignancy. So maybe the answer is "kyllä" (yes). But the report also says the exact score can't be classified due to resolution. So there are findings that could be malignant, but it's uncertain. However, the user's instruction says to report "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the presence is indicated by the mention of grading (even if uncertain), perhaps the answer is "kyllä". But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the report doesn't confirm malignancy definitively, maybe it's NA. Wait, the second question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings. If the report is discussing grading, which is for cancer, then yes. So I think "kyllä" is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3, but says that due to a mistake in digitization, it's hard to assess. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually. Since the exact score isn't determined here, and the report doesn't provide a specific Gleason sum, the answer should be NA. Even though they mention possible grades, the actual score isn't reported, so we can't extract a sum. Therefore, Gleason grade is NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: kyllä (since grading is discussed, implying cancer)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no specific sum provided)
