Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "suspektista fokuksesta" suggests that they took samples from suspicious foci in the prostate. This sounds like a biopsy, where multiple suspicious areas are sampled. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja", which translates to varying degrees of cell differentiation. However, it also states that the exact score can't be classified due to resolution issues in digital images. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually. The presence of different grades suggests there are malignant cells, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. However, since they're discussing Gleason grading (like 3+4 or 4+3), which is specific to cancer, it's implied that malignancy is present. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that due to a mistake in digitization, it's hard to assign a precise score. Since they can't determine the exact grade from the digital images, the actual Gleason score isn't provided. However, the user instructions say to return the worst lesion's results. But if the exact score isn't given, maybe we should put "NA". Wait, but the third field requires "NA" only if the findings are benign. Since we determined malignancy is present ("kyllä"), but the exact Gleason score isn't available due to technical issues, how should we handle this? The instructions say to report the Gleason grade for malignant cases. If the grade isn't specified, maybe "NA" is still acceptable here. Alternatively, if the examples given (3+4, 4+3) are part of the discussion but not the actual reported grade, then the answer should be "NA". The key is that the report doesn't state a specific Gleason score, just mentions possible grades that could be hard to assess. Therefore, the Gleason grade isn't provided, so "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: kyllä
3. Gleason: NA
