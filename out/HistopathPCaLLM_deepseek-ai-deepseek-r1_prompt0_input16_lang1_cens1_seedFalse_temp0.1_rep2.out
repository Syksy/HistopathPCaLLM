Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa" which translates to multiple suspicious foci in the prostate. This sounds like a biopsy, as they're taking samples from suspicious areas. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which indicates varying degrees of cell differentiation. However, it also states that the exact score couldn't be classified due to resolution issues in digital images. The conclusion recommends regrading manually, suggesting that there might be some concern, but the report doesn't explicitly confirm malignancy. The presence of grading discussions implies suspicion, but without a confirmed score, it's unclear. Since the report doesn't definitively state malignancy, the safest answer here might be "ei" (no) or "NA". But wait, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If there's any mention of possible malignancy, maybe "kyllä"? Hmm, the text doesn't confirm malignancy, just mentions varying grades and issues with scoring. Since it's uncertain, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't clearly state presence or absence, so "NA" might be correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy status is unclear, but the text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3, but due to a mistake in digitization, they can't be accurately assessed. So even though there's a mention of possible grades, the actual score isn't determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be assessed.
