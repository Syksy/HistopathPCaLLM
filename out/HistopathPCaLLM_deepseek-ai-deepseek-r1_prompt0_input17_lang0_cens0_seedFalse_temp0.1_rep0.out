Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." which immediately makes me think of RP. The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so the sample type here is definitely RP. That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "malignant tumor findings" indirectly but clearly. It talks about "the most dominant Gleason grade 4" and "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." Infiltration into surrounding tissues and the presence of Gleason grades (which are used to classify prostate cancer) indicate malignancy. Also, perineural invasion is a sign of aggressive cancer. So, the answer here should be "yes."

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." In Gleason scoring, the primary (most prevalent) grade is listed first, followed by the secondary. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The answer should be "4+3=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions "most dominant" grade 4, so that's the primary. Even though there's grade 3, the highest grade present is 4, so that's the major component. The sum is correctly 4+3=7. Also, the other parts about the tumor infiltrating the capsule and perineural invasion support that this is the most severe lesion reported.

No nested structures in the JSON, so just a flat structure with the three keys. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: RP. Malignant: yes. Gleason: 4+3=7. All seems correct. No ambiguities here. The answer should be valid JSON without any extra nesting.
