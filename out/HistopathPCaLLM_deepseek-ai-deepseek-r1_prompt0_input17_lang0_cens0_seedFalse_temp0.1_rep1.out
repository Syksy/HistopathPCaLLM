Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. Since prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, that would fall under RP. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says there's a tumor infiltrating through the capsule to the fat, mentions perineural invasion, and refers to Gleason grades. All these indicate malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The statement says the most dominant is grade 4 along with some grade 3. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) grade is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The answer should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, the user specified to take the most severe lesion's results, which here is the dominant Gleason 4. The answer should be valid JSON with those three fields filled accordingly.
