Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it starts with "Prostatectomy preparate is processed..." So prostatectomy refers to RP. So the answer here should be "RP".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "malignant tumor findings" implicitly. It talks about "the most dominant Gleason grade 4", "tumor infiltrating through the capsule", and "perineural invasion". All these indicate malignancy. So the answer is "yes".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The statement says "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

Need to make sure we're only taking the most severe lesion. The text mentions "most dominant" which is grade 4, so that's the primary. The secondary is grade 3. So the sum is correct. Also, check that there's no higher grade mentioned. The answer should be "4+3=7".

No nested structures in JSON. So the final JSON should have these three key-value pairs.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
