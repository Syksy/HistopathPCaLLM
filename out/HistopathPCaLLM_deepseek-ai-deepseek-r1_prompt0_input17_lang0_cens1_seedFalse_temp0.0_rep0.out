Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prepared samples" processed through standard procedures. The report talks about different parts of the prostate (right side, left side, samples A-D, etc.), but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." Gleason grades 3-5 are typically associated with cancer, but the report seems to be discussing the possibility of assessing whether these grades are present or if the tissue is healthy. It's a preliminary report, and the final assessment is pending. So there's no definitive statement confirming malignancy. Therefore, the answer here should be NA since it's not confirmed yet.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, and the report mentions Gleason grades 3-5 as possibilities but not specific scores, there's no exact Gleason grade provided. So the answer here is also NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since the report is preliminary and inconclusive, all answers default to NA. The JSON structure should have these three fields without any nesting.
