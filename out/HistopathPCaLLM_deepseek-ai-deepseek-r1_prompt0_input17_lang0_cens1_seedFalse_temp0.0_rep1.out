Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prepared samples" processed through standard procedures. The text talks about different parts of the prostate (right side, left side, apex, basis) and how samples are labeled from A to O. However, there's no explicit mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." Gleason grades 3-5 are part of the scoring system for prostate cancer, with higher numbers indicating more aggressive tumors. However, the statement seems to be part of a preliminary report where the actual assessment is pending. It says the assessment will be done by residents in a course session, and the consensus will be added later. So, there's no definitive conclusion here about malignancy. The presence of Gleason grades is mentioned as a possibility ("are at all present") but not confirmed. Therefore, the answer here is "NA" because it's not confirmed whether malignant findings are present.

Lastly, the reported Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it's unclear if these are actual findings or part of a hypothetical scenario for the residents' assignment. Since the report is preliminary and the assessment is pending, there's no specific Gleason score provided. Therefore, the answer here is "NA".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since the data is preliminary and no conclusive results are given, all fields default to NA. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so each answer is a direct value.
