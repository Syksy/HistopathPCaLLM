Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prepared samples" processed through standard procedures. The report talks about different parts of the prostate (right side, left side, samples A-D, etc.), but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." Gleason grades 3-5 are part of the scoring system for prostate cancer, but the way it's phrased here is a bit ambiguous. It seems like they're assessing whether there are any Gleason grades present (which would indicate malignancy) or if it's healthy. However, the report is preliminary and mentions that the final assessment will be done later. So there's no definitive statement confirming malignancy. Therefore, the answer here might be NA since it's not conclusive yet.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5 are being assessed, but it doesn't specify a particular score. Since it's part of an upcoming assessment and not confirmed, there's no reported Gleason grade here. So the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. Need to make sure not to include nested structures and only the most severe lesion, but since there's no conclusive info, all fields are NA.
