Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prepared samples" processed through standard procedures. There's mention of the prostate's right and left sides, and samples labeled from A to O. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." The Gleason grades 3-5 suggest possible malignancy, but the statement is part of an assessment that's pending. It says the final consensus will be added later. Since it's a preliminary report and they're waiting for further assessment, there's no definitive yes or no here. So the answer should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. However, the text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 are present, but it's unclear if these are the actual grades of a tumor or part of a teaching example. Since the report is preliminary and the assessment is pending, there's no confirmed Gleason score provided. Therefore, the answer here is also NA.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since the data is inconclusive, all fields default to NA. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each part to confirm there's no mention of sample type or definitive malignancy. Yep, looks like all answers should be NA.
