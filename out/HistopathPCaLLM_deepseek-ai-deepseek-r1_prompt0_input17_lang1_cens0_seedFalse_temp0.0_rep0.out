Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the report, the term used is "prostatetomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" is Finnish for prostatectomy, so RP would be the correct type here. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason grading is for cancer, this indicates malignancy. Also, terms like "kasvain infiltroi" (tumor infiltrating) confirm malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report the major + minor = sum. The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The dominant (major) is 4, minor is 3. So 4+3=7. The format should be "4+3=7".

Also, need to check if there are any other details that might affect the answers. The report mentions apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the basis. However, since we only take the worst lesion, which is in the basis with Gleason 4+3. Perineural invasion and capsular infiltration are noted but don't affect the Gleason score. 

So the structured data should be:
1. RP
2. kyllä
3. 4+3=7

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
