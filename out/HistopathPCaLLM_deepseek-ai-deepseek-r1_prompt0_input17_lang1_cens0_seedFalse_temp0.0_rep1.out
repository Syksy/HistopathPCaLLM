Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the report, the term used is "prostatetomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" is Finnish for prostatectomy, so RP would be the correct type here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason 3 and 4 are both cancerous (though 3 is less aggressive), the presence of any indicates malignancy. Also, phrases like "kasvain infiltroi selvästi" (tumor clearly infiltrates) confirm malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary (major) pattern is 4, and the secondary (minor) is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, check that only the worst lesion is considered. Here, the main focus is Gleason 4, which is worse than 3, so that's correctly captured.

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetomiapreparaatti" definitely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, so RP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason score is correctly calculated. All fields are filled appropriately without nesting.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
