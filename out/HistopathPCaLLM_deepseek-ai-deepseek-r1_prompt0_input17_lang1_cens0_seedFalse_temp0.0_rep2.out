Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the report, the term used is "prostatetomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" is Finnish for prostatectomy, so RP would be the correct type here. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason grading is only for malignancies, this confirms malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary (major) is 4, secondary (minor) is 3, so sum is 4+3=7. The format should be "4+3=7".

Also, need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The main focus here is the major grade 4, so that's correct. Other areas like apex and seminal vesicles are clean, so the worst is in the base. 

Perineural invasion and capsular infiltration are noted, but those don't affect the Gleason score directly. The key info is the Gleason 4+3. So the structured data should be as above.
