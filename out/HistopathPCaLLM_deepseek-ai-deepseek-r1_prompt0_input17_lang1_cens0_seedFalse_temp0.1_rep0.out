Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So that's likely RP. The other terms like biopsy or TURP aren't mentioned here, so I'll go with "RP" for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason grading is for cancer, this indicates malignancy. Also, phrases like "kasvain infiltroi" (tumor infiltrates) confirm malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report says "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4" (predominant grade 4) and "mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3" (some grade 3). The major is 4, minor is 3, so sum is 7. The format should be "4+3=7". Even though there's perineural invasion and capsular penetration, those don't affect the Gleason score. The apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base, so we take the worst lesion's Gleason.

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's data. All other details like perineural invasion or locations are irrelevant for these fields. So the final JSON should have RP, kyllä, and 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
