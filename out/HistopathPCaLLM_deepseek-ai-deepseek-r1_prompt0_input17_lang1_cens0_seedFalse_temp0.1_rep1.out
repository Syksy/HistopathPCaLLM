Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the report, it mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti", which is Finnish for prostatectomy specimen. So that would be RP.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report says "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Also mentions invasion into fat and perineural invasion. So definitely malignant. Answer "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is major + minor = sum. The report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4" (dominant grade 4) and some grade 3. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum 7. So "4+3=7".

Check if any other parts might have conflicting info. Apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base. Since we take the worst lesion, which is the base with 4+3. Perineural invasion and capsular penetration don't affect Gleason, just staging. So the answer should be correct.
