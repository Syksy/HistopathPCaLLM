Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So that's likely RP. The other terms like TURP aren't mentioned, so RP is the answer here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report talks about "selkeä fokus" with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason grading is for cancer, that's malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the format is major + minor = sum. The text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4" (predominant grade 4) and mentions some grade 3. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

Checking for any other details: perineural invasion and capsular infiltration are noted, but those don't affect the required fields. Also, apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base. Since we only need the worst lesion's Gleason, which is 4+3=7.

No nested structures allowed, so each answer is straightforward. Let's make sure the JSON syntax is correct with the specified keys and allowed values.
