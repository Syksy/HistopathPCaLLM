Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, there's mention of "täyskropan kuvantamisella" which translates to "full-section imaging," but that doesn't directly indicate the sample type. The report talks about multiple samples (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the original type isn't mentioned here. I'll go with NA for the first field.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which means differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5. Gleason scores are for cancer grading, so presence of Gleason suggests malignancy. However, the report says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" which translates to "whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal." This seems uncertain; the assessment is left to specialists next week. So the conclusion isn't definitive. But since Gleason is being considered, maybe the presence is implied. Wait, but the user wants the worst lesion's results. If they're considering Gleason 3-5, but haven't confirmed, maybe the answer is still "kyllä" because they're evaluating it? Or "ei" if it's not confirmed yet. Hmm. The text says "voidaan arvioida" (can be assessed) but the actual assessment is pending. So maybe the presence isn't confirmed. The answer might be "NA" or "ei". But the presence of Gleason evaluation usually indicates suspicion. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings? If the report is preliminary and the assessment is pending, maybe it's not confirmed. So the answer could be "NA". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if they mention Gleason scores, even if pending, does that imply malignancy? Maybe the answer is "kyllä" because they are considering Gleason grades. But the text says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä" (whether they are present at all), which suggests uncertainty. So perhaps the presence is not confirmed, hence "ei" or "NA". The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report doesn't state malignancy definitively, and the assessment is pending, maybe "NA" is safer. But I need to check again. The user says to take the worst lesion's results. If they are evaluating Gleason, even if pending, does that mean there's malignancy? Maybe the answer is "kyllä" because the presence of Gleason grading implies cancer. But the text says "whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal." So it's possible that there are no findings. Therefore, the presence is uncertain. So the answer should be "NA" because it's not confirmed yet.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". If there are no malignant findings (if we answered "ei" or "NA" for the second field), then Gleason is "NA". But if we answered "kyllä", then we need the sum. However, the text mentions the differentiation grades are between 3 and 5, but no specific score is given. The actual assessment is left for specialists. So there's no reported Gleason score here. Therefore, even if malignancy is present, the Gleason is not provided, so "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: NA (assessment pending)
3. Gleason: NA (not provided)
