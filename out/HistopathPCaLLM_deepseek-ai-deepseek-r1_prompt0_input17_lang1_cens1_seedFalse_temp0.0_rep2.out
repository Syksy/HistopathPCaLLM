Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the report mentions "täyskropan kuvantamisella" which translates to "imaging of the entire prostate". That makes me think of a radical prostatectomy (RP). But wait, the samples are labeled A-O, which might indicate different sections. However, the term "täyskroppa" (total removal) is a strong hint for RP. So I'll go with "RP" for the first field.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which means differentiation degrees for Gleason between 3 and 5. Gleason scores are for cancer grading, so if they're discussing Gleason, that implies malignancy. But wait, the report says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" (whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal). This seems uncertain. However, the presence of Gleason evaluation suggests that there might be some suspicion, but the final assessment is pending. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if the report is inconclusive, maybe "NA"? But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the report is preliminary and the evaluation is left to specialists next week, maybe the current answer is "NA". But the mention of Gleason scores between 3-5 suggests that there are some findings, but it's not confirmed. Hmm. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the Gleason is being considered, even if pending, does that mean malignancy is present? Or is it possible that the samples are benign but being evaluated? The text says "tukien histopatologiaa" which supports histopathology, but the actual assessment is pending. So maybe the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed yet. Therefore, the answer might be "NA" for the second field. But I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, since Gleason is mentioned, maybe "kyllä" because Gleason is only used for cancer. But the report is preliminary, so maybe they haven't confirmed. I need to check the exact wording. The text says "voidaan todnäk arvioida esim. erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een siten että onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia." So they are assessing whether there are any Gleason grades (3-5) present or if the material is normal. Since it's not yet determined, the presence of malignancy is uncertain. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". If there's no malignancy, it's "NA". But if malignancy is present, then the sum. Since the presence is uncertain (NA in the second field), the Gleason would also be "NA". However, the text mentions that differentiation degrees are between 3 and 5, but no specific score is given. Even if malignancy is present, without a specific sum, we can't provide a value. So "NA" here as well.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: RP (because of "täyskropan")
2. Malignant findings: NA (assessment pending)
3. Gleason: NA (no specific score given)
