Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, there's mention of "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti" which translates to processed according to standard routine procedures. The samples are labeled A-D, E-F, G-N, etc. This seems like a surgical specimen, possibly from a radical prostatectomy (RP). Biopsy samples are usually fewer, while RP involves multiple sections from different parts. So I'm leaning towards "RP" for the first field.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which refers to differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5. Gleason scores are only relevant if there's malignancy. However, the report states that the evaluation is left to specialists in an upcoming session. So it's not confirmed here. The presence of Gleason grading suggests possible malignancy, but the report doesn't explicitly state it. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's pending further evaluation, maybe "NA" is safer here. But wait, the instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. If they mention Gleason grades 3-5, does that imply malignancy? Because Gleason is for cancer grading. So maybe the answer should be "kyllä". Hmm, conflicting. The text says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" which translates to whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal. So it's uncertain, pending further assessment. Therefore, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed yet. So "NA" might be correct here.

Third, the reported Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 and 5. But it's not specified which is major or minor. The evaluation is left for specialists next week. So no specific sum is given. Therefore, the answer should be "NA". But wait, the instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. If they mention the range 3-5, maybe the highest possible is 5, but since it's not confirmed, we can't assign a specific value. So "NA" is appropriate here.

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: RP (since it's a full prostate specimen with multiple sections)
2. Malignancy: NA (because it's pending evaluation, not confirmed)
3. Gleason: NA (no specific sum provided)
