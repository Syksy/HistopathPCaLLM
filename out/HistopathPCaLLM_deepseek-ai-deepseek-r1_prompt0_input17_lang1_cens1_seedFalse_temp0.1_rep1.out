Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, there's mention of "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin" which suggests routine processing, but the sample types mentioned are parts of the prostate (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O). The terms like "täyskropan kuvantamisella" might refer to a radical prostatectomy (RP), but I'm not sure. However, the text doesn't explicitly state RP, TURP, or biopsy. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here, so I should go with "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which implies that there are Gleason grades between 3 and 5. Gleason grades are used for cancer, so this suggests malignancy. However, the report says that the evaluation is left to specialists in the upcoming session. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed yet, just that there are areas that might be assessed. The question is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. Since it's not definitively stated, maybe the answer is "NA". But wait, the Gleason grades mentioned (3-5) are for cancer, so perhaps the answer is "kyllä". But the report is preliminary, and the final assessment is pending. Hmm, this is tricky. The user wants the worst lesion's results. If there's mention of Gleason, even if pending, does that imply malignancy? Maybe the presence is "kyllä" because they are considering Gleason scores, which are for cancer. So I'll go with "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The text says "Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een". This could mean different patterns, like major and minor components. But the exact sum isn't given. However, the instruction says to report the worst lesion's Gleason as "major+minor=sum". Since the range is 3 to 5, maybe the worst is 5, but without specific primary and secondary grades, it's unclear. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA". Since the exact sum isn't provided, even though there's a range, the answer should be "NA" because it's not a specific sum. But wait, maybe the highest possible sum from the range is 5, but the format requires major and minor. Since it's not specified, perhaps "NA" is safer here. The report mentions that the evaluation is left for specialists, so the Gleason grade isn't finalized. Therefore, "NA".

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Alkuperäistä näytetyyppiä (biopsia/RP/TURP) ei mainita suoraan raportissa, eikä sitä voida päätellä annetuista kudoskuvauksista (A-O-näytteet viittaavat lähinnä prostatan eri osiin).
2. Pahanlaatuisuus voidaan päätellä epäsuorasti, koska raportissa käsitellään Gleason-asteikon arviointia (välillä 3-5) ja erilaistumisasteita, mikä viittaa mahdolliseen maligniteettiin. Kuitenkaan lopullista arviota ei ole vielä tehty.
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei ole vielä määritetty (mainitaan, että arviointi jätetään erikoistuville lääkäreille), eikä yksittäistä summaa tai selvää enemmistöluokkaa voida erottaa annetuista kuvauksista.
