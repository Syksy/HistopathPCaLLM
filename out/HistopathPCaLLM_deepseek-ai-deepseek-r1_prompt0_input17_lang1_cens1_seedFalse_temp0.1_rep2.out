Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples mentioned are A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O. The report talks about processing the right and left sides of the prostate, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here. I'll have to put NA for that.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions assessing differentiation grades for Gleason from 3 to 5, but it's phrased as "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" (whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal). The report says that the evaluation is left to specialists in an upcoming session. So there's no definitive statement of malignancy found. The presence isn't confirmed, so the answer here should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but leaves it for further evaluation, maybe NA is better. But the question is whether malignant findings were present in the sample. Since the evaluation is pending, perhaps the answer is NA. But the user wants only the worst lesion's results. However, the text doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, so maybe "ei" if they consider that no malignancy was found, but the report is inconclusive. Hmm, tricky. The text says "täysin normaalia" (completely normal) as a possibility, but it's part of the assessment that's pending. Since the final evaluation isn't done yet, maybe the presence is not confirmed, so "ei" or NA? The instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state malignancy, but leaves it to be determined later, perhaps the answer is NA. But the user might expect "ei" if no malignancy is found. Wait, the text says "voidaan arvioida esim. erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which suggests that there might be some differentiation grades (Gleason) between 3-5, but it's not confirmed. However, the presence of Gleason grading would imply malignancy. But since the evaluation is pending, maybe it's not confirmed. So the presence of malignancy is uncertain here. Therefore, the answer should be NA. But I need to check if the mention of Gleason implies malignancy. Gleason is for prostate cancer grading, so if they are considering Gleason scores, that would indicate malignancy. But the text says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä" (whether they are present at all). So it's possible that there are, but it's not confirmed. Therefore, the presence of malignancy isn't determined yet. So the answer for question 2 is NA.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers, or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed (question 2 is NA), the Gleason would be NA. Even though they mention assessing Gleason between 3-5, since it's not confirmed, we can't report a specific score. So Gleason is NA.

So the final answers would be:
1. NA (sample type not specified)
2. NA (malignancy not confirmed)
3. NA (no Gleason as malignancy not confirmed)
