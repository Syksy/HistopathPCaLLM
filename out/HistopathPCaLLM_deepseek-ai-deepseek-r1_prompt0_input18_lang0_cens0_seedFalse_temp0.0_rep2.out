Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I know that TURP often involves removing tissue chips, so that's probably TURP here. Biopsy is usually needle samples, and RP is the whole prostate. So sample type is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason sum 7" with the larger fraction being stage 3 (which is the major grade) and 60% of the tumor area. The format should be major+minor=sum. The sum is 7, and since the major is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason scoring takes the most common grade as the first number and the next most common as the second. Wait, the report says "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." So if the larger fraction is 3 (60%), then the major is 3. But wait, the sum is 7. So 3 + 4 =7. Because 3 is the major (most prevalent) and 4 is the minor. So the Gleason grade should be 3+4=7.

So putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 3+4=7. Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion. Since there's only one carcinoma mentioned, that's the one to report.
