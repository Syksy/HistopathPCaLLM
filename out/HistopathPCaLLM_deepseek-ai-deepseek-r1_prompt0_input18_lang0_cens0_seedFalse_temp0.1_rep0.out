Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I remember that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves shaving or removing tissue chips, especially for treating enlarged prostates. Biopsy is usually needle samples, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the removal of the entire prostate. So here, TURP seems correct.

Next, malignant findings. The text says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer should be "yes."

For Gleason grade, the example format is major+minor=sum. The text states "Gleason sum 7" with the larger fraction being stage 3 (which is the major) and presumably the minor would be 4 since 3+4=7. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The answer here seems straightforward as there's only one carcinoma mentioned. All fields are covered, and the values fit the allowed options.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
