Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, using only the most severe lesion's information.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure". I recall that "TURP" often involves removing tissue from the prostate using a shaving method, especially for treating enlarged prostates. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report states "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma". Since carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text specifies "Gleason sum 7" with the larger fraction being stage 3 (which is Gleason pattern 3) and 60% of the tumor area. The Gleason score is typically reported as major + minor = sum. Here, the major component is pattern 3, but wait, the sum is 7. If the sum is 3+4=7, then major is 3 and minor is 4. However, the description says the larger fraction is stage 3 (60%), so the major would be 3 and minor 4. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's only one carcinoma mentioned with Gleason 7, that's the one to report. The JSON should not have nested structures, so straightforward key-value pairs. Double-checking allowed values and making sure there's no NA unless necessary. All fields here have valid answers, so no NAs needed.

  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
