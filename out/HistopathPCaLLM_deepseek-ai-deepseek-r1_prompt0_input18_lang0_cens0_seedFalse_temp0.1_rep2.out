Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I'm not entirely sure what "standard shaving procedure" refers to. TURP often involves removing tissue from the prostate, which might result in chippings. Biopsy usually involves taking small samples with a needle. Since TURP is a procedure where they shave off parts of the prostate, maybe "chippings" here are from TURP. So I'll go with TURP for the sample type.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." The preferred format is major+minor=sum. Since stage 3 is the larger fraction (60%), that would be the major grade (4) and the minor would be 3, but wait, the sum is 7. Wait, Gleason grades are based on the two most prevalent patterns. If the sum is 7, it's either 3+4 or 4+3. The text says the larger fraction is stage 3. Wait, stage 3 in Gleason refers to pattern 3. But the sum is 7. If the larger part is pattern 3 (60%), then the major is 3 and the minor would be 4 (3+4=7). But the way it's written: "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Wait, maybe "stage 3" here is a typo and should be "grade 3." Assuming that, then major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason grade should be 3+4=7. But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So the answer would be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user says "reported Gleason grade" as "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason sum 7" and mentions the larger fraction is stage 3 (maybe grade 3). So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in JSON. So the JSON should have these three keys with the corresponding values.
