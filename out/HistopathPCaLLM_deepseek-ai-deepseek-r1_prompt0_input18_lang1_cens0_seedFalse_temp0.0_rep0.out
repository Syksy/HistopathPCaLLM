Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja," which translates to shavings or chips obtained from a procedure. TURP typically produces chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text states "nähdään karsinoomaa" (carcinoma is seen), which confirms malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Gleason score is usually the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. If the sum is 7, but the major component is grade 3 (60% of the tumor), then the minor would be grade 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the user specified the format as "major+minor=sum". So here, it should be 3+4=7. But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major (higher proportion) is grade 3. So the correct notation is 3+4=7.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON output. All values should be straightforward. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, which in this case is Gleason 7. The carcinoma portion is small (alle 5%), but since it's present, malignancy is confirmed. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because of the chips mentioned. Biopsy would be cores, RP is the whole prostate. So the structured data should be TURP, yes, and 3+4=7.
