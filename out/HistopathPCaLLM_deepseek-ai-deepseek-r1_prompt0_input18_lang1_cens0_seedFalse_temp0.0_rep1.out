Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläys" translates to shaving or planing, which might refer to a TURP procedure. TURP is a common procedure for removing prostate tissue, especially in cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia, but sometimes cancer is found incidentally. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text says "pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Gleason score is typically the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. If the major component is grade 3 and the minor is grade 4, the sum would be 3+4=7. But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major grade is 3, and the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). So the correct format is "3+4=7". However, the user specified the format as "major+minor=sum" with integers. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example in the problem statement shows "major+minor=sum" as the format. Let me double-check. The text says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." So the sum is 7, with the major (larger portion) being grade 3 (60%), which implies the minor is grade 4. So 3+4=7. That's correct. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Now, compiling all the answers:

1. Sample type: TURP
2. Malignancy: kyllä
3. Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each key is a top-level entry. Also, ensure that the values are exactly as per the allowed options. For example, "kyllä" is correct for Finnish, and the Gleason format matches "major+minor=sum".

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
