Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja", which translates to shavings or chips obtained. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chips, so that's probably "TURP". Biopsy is usually needle cores, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is the whole gland. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The text says "nähdään karsinoomaa" which means carcinoma is present. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60%". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Gleason score is primary + secondary = sum. If the sum is 7, and the major component is 3 (60%), then the secondary would be 4 (since 3+4=7). So the correct format is "3+4=7". The user specified "major+minor=sum" as integers. So the answer here is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. All three fields are top-level. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions the carcinoma portion is small (under 5%), but the Gleason score given is for the neoplastic part, which is the worst one here. So that's correct.

Double-checking the sample type. TURP is correct for chips. The malignancy is confirmed. Gleason 3+4=7 is correctly formatted. All values fit the allowed options. No issues here.
