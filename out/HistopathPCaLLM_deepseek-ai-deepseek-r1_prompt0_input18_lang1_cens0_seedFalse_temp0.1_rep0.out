Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja," which translates to shavings or chips obtained, likely from a TURP procedure. Biopsy usually refers to needle cores, and RP is a surgical removal. So TURP seems correct here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "nähdään karsinoomaa," which means carcinoma is present. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60%." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, Gleason scores are primary + secondary = sum. If the sum is 7, but the major component is grade 3, that would mean primary 3 and secondary 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the mention here says the major component is grade 3 (60% of the tumor), so secondary would be grade 4. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7". 

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion is considered and that the structure isn't nested. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 3+4=7. All other details like the percentage of carcinoma (under 5%) don't affect these specific fields. So the JSON should reflect these three points accurately.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
