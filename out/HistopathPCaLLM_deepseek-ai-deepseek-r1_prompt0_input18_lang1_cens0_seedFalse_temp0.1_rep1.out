Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläys" translates to shaving or planing, which might refer to a TURP procedure. TURP is a common procedure for removing prostate tissue, especially in cases of BPH, but sometimes cancer is found incidentally. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), which is malignant. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Gleason scoring is based on the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. The sum is the addition of the two grades. If the major is grade 3 and the minor is grade 4, the sum would be 7 (3+4=7). But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major component is grade 3. Then the minor would be grade 4 because 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". However, the user specified the format as "major+minor=sum". So the correct notation here is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." So the major pattern is grade 3 (since it's the larger portion, 60%), and the minor would be grade 4 to sum to 7. So yes, 3+4=7. That's correct.

So putting it all together:

1. Alkuperäinen tyyppi: TURP
2. Pahanlaatuisia: kyllä
3. Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is a simple value. Also, the user mentioned to take only the worst lesion's results. Since the carcinoma is present and Gleason 7 is reported, that's the highest here. The sample type is correctly identified as TURP based on the description of the procedure.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
