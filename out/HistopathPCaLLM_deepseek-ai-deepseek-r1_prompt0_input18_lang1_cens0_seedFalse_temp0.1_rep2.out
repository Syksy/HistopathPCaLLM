Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja", which translates to shavings or chips obtained. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically produces chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP. Biopsy would be a needle biopsy, and RP is radical prostatectomy, which isn't mentioned here. So I'll go with "TURP".

Next, whether there's malignancy. The text clearly states "nähdään karsinoomaa" (carcinoma is seen), so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista". Wait, that's a bit confusing. Gleason score is the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. If the major is 3 and minor is 4, the sum is 7. But the text says the major is 3 (suuremman osuuden luokka 3) which accounts for 60% of the tumor. Wait, that doesn't add up. If the major is 3 and minor is 4, sum is 3+4=7. But the way it's phrased here: "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60%". So the sum is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60%). So the major is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the format should be "3+4=7". But the user wants "major+minor=sum" as the value. So the correct entry is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instructions say to report the Gleason grade only for malignant findings. Since malignancy is present, we need to report it. So the third field is "3+4=7".

Let me double-check each part. Sample type: TURP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 3+4=7. That seems right. The text also mentions the carcinoma portion is small (alle 5%), but the worst lesion's Gleason is still 3+4=7. The user specified to take the worst lesion's results. So this is correct.
