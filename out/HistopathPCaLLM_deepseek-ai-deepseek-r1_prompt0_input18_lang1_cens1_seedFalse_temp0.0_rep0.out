Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä" which translates to standard prostate procedures. The term "näytemateriaali" (sample material) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since the procedure isn't specified, I'll have to go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says there's a small area that might contain ISUP GG 1 or higher, which is Grade Group 1, indicating a low-grade cancer. However, it's noted that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. The majority (over 95%) appears benign. But since there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant, even if uncertain, the presence of malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes). The key here is that any mention of potential malignancy, even if uncertain, would mean "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the format is major + minor = sum. The text mentions ISUP GG 1, which corresponds to Gleason score 3+3=6. However, the report states that the focus is too small for reliable grading. But the instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. Even though it's uncertain, if they mention GG1, which is 3+3=6, we should report that. But wait, the user instructions specify that for benign findings, it's NA. But in this case, there's a suspicion of malignancy, so maybe we should report the Gleason. However, the problem is that the suspekti fokus is too small for reliable grading. The question is, do we take the mentioned GG1 as the reported grade or consider it as not reliable and put NA? The answer might depend on whether the GG1 is considered a reported finding. The text says "saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa" (may contain a small part of ISUP GG1 or higher). Since it's a possibility but not confirmed, maybe the Gleason isn't reliably determined. But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. If they mention GG1, even if uncertain, perhaps we should report 3+3=6. But the problem is that the grading isn't reliable. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). So if they mention GG1, even if uncertain, that's the worst they mention. So maybe 3+3=6. But I need to check if ISUP GG1 corresponds to Gleason 3+3=6. Yes, ISUP Grade Group 1 is Gleason score ≤6, which is 3+3. So the answer here would be "3+3=6". However, the report says that the focus is too small for reliable grading, so maybe they didn't assign a Gleason score. But the text does mention GG1, so perhaps it's acceptable to report it. Alternatively, if the grading isn't reliable, maybe it's NA. This is a bit ambiguous. The user's instruction says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (reported Gleason grade). If the report mentions GG1, even if uncertain, that's the reported grade. So I think it's 3+3=6. 

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: kyllä (because of possible GG1)
3. Gleason grade: 3+3=6
