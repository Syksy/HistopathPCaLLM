Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä" which translates to standard prostate procedures. However, the exact procedure isn't specified. Biopsy, RP, and TURP are all standard procedures, but the text doesn't mention which one. So maybe the sample type isn't explicitly stated here. Therefore, I might have to go with NA for the first field.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text says that a small part (alle 5%) might contain ISUP GG 1 or higher, which is Grade Group 1, indicating a low-grade cancer. However, it's noted that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. The majority (over 95%) appears benign. Even though there's a suspicion of GG1, which is technically malignant, the report doesn't confirm it definitively. The presence of "saattaa sisältää" (may contain) suggests uncertainty. So, should this be considered as malignant or not? The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since it's a suspicion but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant. But the report also says it's too small to grade reliably. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" or NA. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they found some suspicious areas but couldn't confirm, does that count as malignant? The presence of ISUP GG1 would be malignant, but if it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Or perhaps "kyllä" because they mention the possibility. I need to check the exact wording. The text says "saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa" which translates to "may contain a small part of ISUP GG1 or higher." So it's a possibility, not confirmed. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is uncertain. But the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's a suspicion, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible GG1. Alternatively, if the sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, it's "ei". But the problem states to consider the worst lesion. Wait, the instructions say "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" which means only the worst lesion's results should be returned. So even if it's a small part, if there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant, then the answer for question 2 should be "kyllä". But the report says the focus is too small for reliable grading, so maybe they can't confirm. This is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the Gleason grade would be NA because it's not confirmed. Let me think again. The presence of malignant findings: if there's any mention of malignancy, even suspected, should it be "kyllä"? The options don't have a 'suspected' category. The report says "pienen osuuden lisätutkimus on perusteltua, sillä se saattaa sisältää..." which implies that there's a reason to investigate further because of possible malignancy. So maybe the answer is "kyllä" for question 2. 

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. However, the text mentions ISUP GG1, which corresponds to Gleason 3+3=6. But the report states that the focus is too small for reliable grading. So even though they mention GG1, they can't confirm it. Therefore, the Gleason grade can't be reliably reported. But the instructions say that for benign findings, it's NA, but if there's malignancy, we should report the Gleason. Since the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (as per my previous conclusion), but the grade can't be determined, maybe the Gleason is NA. Wait, the third field's instruction says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if the findings are malignant, report the Gleason; if benign, NA. But in this case, the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, and the Gleason can't be determined. So even though the presence is "kyllä", the Gleason is not reported, hence NA. But the text does mention ISUP GG1, which is equivalent to Gleason 3+3=6. However, the report says the focus is too small for reliable grading, so they didn't actually assign a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason should be NA. 

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't specify whether it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says "standard procedures". So NA.

2. Malignant findings: The possibility of GG1 (malignant) is mentioned, so "kyllä".

3. Gleason grade: Not reliably determined, so NA.

Wait, but the third field's instruction says for malignant findings, report the Gleason. But in this case, even though malignancy is present (answer "kyllä"), the Gleason wasn't determined because the focus was too small. So the answer is NA for Gleason. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the final answers would be:

1. "NA"

2. "kyllä"

3. "NA"
