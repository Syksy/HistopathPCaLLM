Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Näytemateriaali, joka on saatu standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä". The term "standard procedures" here is a bit vague. Common prostate procedures include biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since it's not explicitly stated which one, I might have to default to "NA". But wait, "standardien eturauhasproseduurien" could refer to a biopsy if it's part of standard diagnostic procedures. However, without a specific mention, maybe "NA" is safer. Hmm, but sometimes in medical contexts, "standard procedures" might imply biopsy. I'm a bit unsure here. Let me check the original Finnish again. The phrase is "standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä", which translates to "during standard prostate procedures". Since it's not specified, maybe "NA" is correct here. So, answer for 1 is "NA".

Next, whether there's malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa", which translates to a small portion might be ISUP GG 1 or higher. ISUP GG 1 is Gleason grade group 1, which is considered malignant. However, the report says "saattaa sisältää" (may contain) and "suspekti fokus on nyt liian pieni luotettavan gradeerauksen tekemiseksi" (suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading). So there's a suspicion of malignancy but not confirmed. The question is whether malignant findings were present. Since there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant, but it's not confirmed. However, the presence of "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings) would require confirmation. The report states that over 95% appears benign, and the suspicious area is too small. So maybe the answer here is "ei" because no definitive malignancy is found. But wait, the presence of ISUP GG1 is mentioned as a possibility. However, since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the user instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. Alternatively, if the malignancy is not confirmed, perhaps "ei". But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). Since the worst possible mentioned is GG1 (which is malignant), but it's not confirmed. However, in medical reporting, if there's a suspicion but not confirmed, it's not considered definitive. So maybe "ei" is correct here. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, since the text says "saattaa sisältää" (may contain), which implies possibility but not certainty. So the presence of malignancy is uncertain. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the presence is uncertain, should it be "NA"? Wait, the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's a possible finding but not confirmed, maybe "kyllä" is not appropriate. The report says "yli 95% materiaalista vaikuttaa benigniltä" (over 95% appears benign), and the suspicious area is too small for reliable grading. So the conclusion is that there's no definitive malignancy found. Therefore, the answer for 2 is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer 2 is "ei"), then the Gleason grade should be "NA". However, the text mentions "ISUP GG 1", which corresponds to Gleason 3+3=6. But since the focus is too small for reliable grading, maybe it's not reported. The user instructions say to report the Gleason grade only for malignant cases. Since in this case, the answer to question 2 is "ei", then the Gleason grade is "NA". But wait, the presence of ISUP GG1 is mentioned as a possibility. However, because it's not confirmed, the actual Gleason score isn't provided. So "NA" is correct here.

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: "NA" (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: "ei" (no definitive malignancy found)
3. Gleason grade: "NA" (since no malignancy confirmed)
