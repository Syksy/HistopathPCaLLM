Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä", which translates to standard prostate procedures. Common procedures for prostate samples are biopsies, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The report doesn't specify exactly which one, just refers to standard procedures. Since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the safest choice here is "NA" because the text doesn't clearly state which procedure it was. But wait, sometimes "standard procedures" might refer to a biopsy if it's a diagnostic sample. However, without explicit terms like "biopsia" (biopsy in Finnish), "RP", or "TURP", it's safer to go with "NA".

Second, whether there's malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions a small area that might contain ISUP GG 1 or higher, which is a grade for prostate cancer. However, it's noted that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. The majority (over 95%) appears benign. But since there's a suspicion of GG1, which is malignant, even if uncertain, does that count as malignant? The question is whether the sample has malignant findings. The report says "saattaa sisältää" (may contain) GG1, but it's not confirmed. However, the presence of any suspected malignancy, even if uncertain, might lead to "kyllä". But the instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since there's a suspicion but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible GG1. Alternatively, if the uncertainty means it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". But the key is that the report states that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. So maybe the presence is uncertain, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since there's a part that may contain GG1, which is malignant, even if uncertain, the answer might be "kyllä". However, if the report says it's too small to confirm, perhaps the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If they can't confirm due to size, but there's a suspicion, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The answer might be "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant. But the user instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. Since the worst possible is GG1, even if uncertain, maybe it's considered present. Alternatively, if it's too small to grade, maybe it's not confirmed, hence "ei". This is a bit ambiguous. But in medical reporting, if there's a suspicion but not confirmed, it's often mentioned as such. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. If the report says "saattaa sisältää" (may contain), but it's not confirmed, then technically, the answer might be "ei" because it's not definitively identified. But the presence of a suspicious area that requires further testing might be considered as "kyllä". Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe in this context, since they can't confirm due to size, but there's a suspicion, the answer is "kyllä" because the possibility exists. But I need to check the exact wording. The text says "pienen osuuden lisätutkimus on perusteltua, sillä se saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa" (additional examination of the small part is justified because it may contain a small part of ISUP GG1 or higher). So the reason for further testing is the possibility of GG1 or higher. But in the current sample, they couldn't confirm it. So the actual findings in the sample are benign except for a small suspicious area that's not confirmed. Therefore, the malignant findings are not confirmed, so the answer would be "ei". But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the suspicious area is considered a finding, even if uncertain, then "kyllä". But I think in medical terms, unless it's confirmed, it's not reported as positive. So maybe "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". If there are no malignant findings, it's "NA". If there are, then the sum. Since the possible GG1 is mentioned, but not confirmed, and the majority is benign, the Gleason grade would be "NA" because the malignant findings are not confirmed. Even though there's a suspicion, since it's not graded reliably, it's not reported. So the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP, just standard procedures. So "NA".
2. Malignant findings: The suspicious area isn't confirmed, so "ei".
3. Gleason grade: Since no confirmed malignancy, "NA".
