Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytemateriaali, joka on saatu standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä..." The phrase "standardien eturauhasproseduurien" translates to standard prostate procedures. However, the text doesn't specify which exact procedure. Biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection) are possibilities. Since it's mentioned as "proseduurien yhteydessä" (during the procedure), but no specific terms like TURP or biopsy are mentioned, I might have to go with "NA" here. But wait, sometimes "standard procedures" might refer to biopsy if it's a common approach. But the text isn't explicit. The user might expect "biopsy" if it's a common scenario, but without clear evidence, "NA" is safer.

Next, malignancy presence. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa" which translates to a small part may contain ISUP GG 1 or higher. ISUP GG 1 is a grade group for prostate cancer, which is malignant. However, the report says "saattaa sisältää" (may contain) and that the focus is too small for reliable grading. Also, over 95% appears benign. So there's suspicion but not confirmed malignancy. The question is whether the sample has malignant findings. Since there's a suspicion but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The user's instruction says to report only the worst lesion. If there's a possibility of GG1, even if uncertain, maybe "kyllä" is correct. But the report states that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. Maybe the presence is uncertain, but since there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant, the answer should be "kyllä". However, if the report doesn't confirm malignancy and it's just a suspicion, maybe "ei"? Wait, the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). So even if it's a small part, if there's a mention of possible GG1, which is malignant, then the answer should be "kyllä". Because the worst lesion here is GG1, even if uncertain. So "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". For malignant cases, report it; otherwise "NA". Since we determined malignancy is present ("kyllä"), we need to find the Gleason. The text says "ISUP GG 1". ISUP Grade Group 1 corresponds to Gleason score ≤6, which is 3+3=6. So the Gleason would be "3+3=6". But wait, the report says "saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä" – it might contain a small part of GG1. However, the user wants the worst lesion's results. Even if it's a small part, the worst mentioned is GG1, which is 3+3=6. So the Gleason should be "3+3=6". But the report also mentions that the focus is too small for reliable grading. Does that affect the answer? The user's instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. Even if it's uncertain, if it's mentioned, we should take it. So "3+3=6".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The procedure isn't specified beyond "standard procedures". So "NA".
2. Malignancy: "kyllä" because possible GG1 is mentioned.
3. Gleason: "3+3=6".

Wait, but ISUP Grade Group 1 is Gleason score 3+3=6. So that's correct. Even if the focus is too small, the worst mentioned is GG1, so we report that.
