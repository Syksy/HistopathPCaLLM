Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so the allowed value here is "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So the answer should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report states that in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, Gleason grading combines the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). However, if one is higher than the other, the higher is the major. Here, 3 and 4. Since 4 is higher than 3, the major would be 4 and minor 3. But wait, the percentages are 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. Wait, no, the way Gleason works is that the primary (major) is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most prevalent. Even if a higher grade is present but in a smaller percentage, the primary is the most common. So in this case, the most common is Gleason 3 (90%), so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The user wants "major+minor=sum" as the format, so "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure. The text says "the larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So the majority is Gleason 3, which is the primary, and the secondary is Gleason 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The allowed values for sample type are correct. The malignant is yes. Gleason is in the correct format. Also, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which here is sample 4, which is the only malignant one. So that's covered.
