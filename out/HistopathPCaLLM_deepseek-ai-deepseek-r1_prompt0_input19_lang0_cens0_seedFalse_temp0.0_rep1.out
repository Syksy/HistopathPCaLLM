Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions in sample 4 that the whole cylinder contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes." Even though samples 2 and 3 are benign, the instruction says to consider the most severe lesion, which is sample 4 with malignancy.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states in sample 4 that the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most predominant pattern as the primary (major) and the next most predominant as the secondary (minor). However, if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less in quantity, it's considered the minor. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next highest in grade. So in this case, the major is 3 (since 90% is the largest), and the minor is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3 + 4 = 7. The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format, so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be a flat JSON object with those three keys. Also, check if any of the values need to be NA. For the sample type, it's biopsy. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 3+4=7. All fields are filled, so no NAs here. The answer should be valid JSON without any syntax errors. Let me double-check the example to ensure the format is correct. The user specified to return the most severe lesion, which in this case is sample 4. So the structured data should reflect that.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
