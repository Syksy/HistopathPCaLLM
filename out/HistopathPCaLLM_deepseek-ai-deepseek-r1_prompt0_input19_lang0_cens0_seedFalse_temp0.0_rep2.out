Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Even though samples 2 and 3 are benign, the instruction says to consider the most severe lesion. So the answer here should be yes.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text in sample 4 states that the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher percentage, which is Gleason 3, and minor is Gleason 4. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason grade is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor), but if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, that might be considered. Wait, no, the primary grade is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. But in this case, the larger portion is 90% Gleason 3, and 10% Gleason 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, that's the one to report. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative, so they don't affect the result.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7

I should check if the JSON is valid and that there are no nested structures. The keys should be as specified, and the values must match the allowed options. Also, ensure that "NA" is only used when information isn't present. In this case, all three fields have valid entries, so no NAs needed.
