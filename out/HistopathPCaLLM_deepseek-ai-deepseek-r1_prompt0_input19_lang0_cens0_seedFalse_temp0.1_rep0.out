Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. In sample 4, it mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Even though samples 2 and 3 are benign, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. So the answer here should be yes.

Now the Gleason grade. The format should be major + minor = sum. The text says in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading changed in recent years. Wait, no—the major pattern is the one with the highest area, not the highest grade. Wait, no, actually, the current Gleason scoring system considers the primary (most predominant) and secondary (next most predominant) grades. But if one grade is higher, even if it's a smaller portion, it becomes the primary. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: the Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (primary) and the next most common (secondary). However, if there's a tertiary higher grade, that might affect the score in some cases. But in this case, the largest portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So primary is 4, secondary is 3? Wait, no. Wait, the primary is the most predominant pattern. If the majority is pattern 3 (90%) and a smaller part is pattern 4 (10%), then the primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3 + 4 = 7. But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher grade? Or the most prevalent? Wait, no. The primary grade is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. So in this case, primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%). So the Gleason score is 3 + 4 = 7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes when there's a higher grade even in a smaller amount, does that change the primary? No, I think the primary is still the most prevalent. For example, if there's 60% grade 3 and 40% grade 4, the score is 3+4=7. If it's 40% grade 4 and 60% grade 3, then it's 4+3=7. Wait, no. Wait, the primary is the most common, so if grade 3 is 90% and grade 4 is 10%, primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the score is 3+4=7. So the answer here should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The user specified that only the most severe lesion is considered, which in this case is sample 4. The other samples are benign, but sample 4 is malignant, so that's the one to report. The JSON should be valid, so keys in quotes, proper commas, etc.
