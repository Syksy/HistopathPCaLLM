Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Samples 2 and 3 are benign, but since we're supposed to report the most severe lesion, which is sample 4, the answer here should be yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text says in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). So the major grade is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. So it should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check if any of the values could be NA. For the sample type, biopsy is clear. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 3+4=7. All fields are filled, no NAs needed here. The answer should be a valid JSON with those three keys and the determined values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
