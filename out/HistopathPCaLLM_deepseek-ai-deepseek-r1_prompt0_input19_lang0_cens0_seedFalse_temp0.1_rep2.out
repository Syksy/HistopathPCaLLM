Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Samples 2 and 3 are benign, but since we need the most severe lesion, which is in sample 4, the answer here should be yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. In sample 4, it states that the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most predominant pattern as the primary grade and the next most predominant as the secondary. However, if one of the patterns is higher, even if it's less in percentage, it might still be considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, and secondary is the next. But in cases where there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is considered. Wait, no, the Gleason score is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive). However, if there's a tertiary pattern (higher grade but less than 5%), sometimes it's noted. But in this case, the report says the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The user wants major+minor=sum, so 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Need to make sure there's no nested structures. The JSON should be flat. Also, check if the sample type is correctly identified as biopsy. Yes. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 3+4=7. So the final JSON should have those values.
