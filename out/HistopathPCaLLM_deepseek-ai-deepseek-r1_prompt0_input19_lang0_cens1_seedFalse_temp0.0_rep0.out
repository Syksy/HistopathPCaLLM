Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, it doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are divided into batches, but there's no clear indication of the procedure used. So, I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, possibly malignant. However, it's uncertain whether it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal. They need to verify the lab trajectory first. Since there's a suspicion but no confirmation, the malignancy isn't confirmed. The most severe lesion here is sample 4, which is uncertain. So, the answer should be NA because it's not definitively yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Since the malignancy is uncertain and there's no mention of grading, the answer here is NA. Even if there were some suspicion, without explicit Gleason grades, we can't assign a value.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. Need to make sure not to include nested structures and only the most severe lesion, which in this case is the uncertain sample 4, but since it's not confirmed, all fields remain NA.
