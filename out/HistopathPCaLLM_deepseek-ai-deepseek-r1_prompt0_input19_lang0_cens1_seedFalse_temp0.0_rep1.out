Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, the specific type isn't explicitly stated. There's mention of samples divided into batches, but terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't used. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says sample 4 has tissue that may differ from normal, possibly malignant, but it's uncertain. They need to verify if it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the answer here should be NA. It's not a clear yes or no; more investigation is needed.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum as numbers, or NA if benign. Since the malignant finding is uncertain and not confirmed, there's no Gleason grade reported. So this should be NA.

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The samples 2 and 3 are benign, sample 4 is uncertain. Since sample 4 is the most severe but not confirmed, the answers remain NA for malignancy and Gleason. Original sample type is also NA because it's not specified.
