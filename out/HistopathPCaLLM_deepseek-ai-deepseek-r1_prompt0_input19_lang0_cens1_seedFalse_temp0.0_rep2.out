Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, the specific type like biopsy, RP, or TURP isn't explicitly stated. The samples are referred to as samples 1-4, which might be from a biopsy, but it's not clear. Since there's no direct mention, I should go with NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, possibly malignant. However, it's uncertain due to possible tissue mixing or lab mishap. The conclusion is that they need to verify before proceeding. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the answer here should be NA. It's not a clear yes or no because the possibility is raised but not confirmed.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and Gleason grades are only reported for malignant cases, this should be NA. Even if there's a suspicion, without confirmation, we can't assign a Gleason grade.

So putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant findings are NA, and Gleason grade is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the possible malignancy is in sample 4 but not confirmed, it's the most severe but still not definitive. Hence, all fields remain NA.
