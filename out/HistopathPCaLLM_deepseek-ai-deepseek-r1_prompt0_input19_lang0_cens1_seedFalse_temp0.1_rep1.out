Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, the specific type like biopsy, RP, or TURP isn't explicitly stated. The samples are referred to as samples 1-4, which might be biopsies, but since it's not directly mentioned, I should go with NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal, possibly malignant, but it's uncertain. The lab is checking for a mishap. Since there's a suspicion but no confirmation, it's not a definitive yes. The options are yes, no, or NA. Since NA is allowed when it's uncertain or not confirmed, I think NA is appropriate here. The report doesn't confirm malignancy yet.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. However, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Since the malignancy is uncertain and there's no mention of grading, the answer here should be NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only one with possible issues but not confirmed, the answers remain NA for all.
