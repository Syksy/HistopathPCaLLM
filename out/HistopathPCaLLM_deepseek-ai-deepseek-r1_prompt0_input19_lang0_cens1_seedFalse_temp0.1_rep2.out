Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, it doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are divided into batches, but there's no clear indication of the procedure type. So, I think the answer here should be "NA" because the sample type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, and there's uncertainty about whether it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal (possibly malignant). However, it's noted that they need to verify the lab trajectory before confirming. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the presence of malignancy isn't definitively stated. So, the answer here should be "no" because there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy. Alternatively, if "possibly malignant" is considered enough for "yes," but the instructions say to report the most severe lesion. But since it's uncertain and needs verification, "no" might be safer. Wait, the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." The most severe here is sample 4, which is uncertain. But the report doesn't confirm malignancy. So "no" or "NA"? The options are yes, no, NA. Since it's uncertain, maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the possibility is mentioned but not confirmed, does that count as "no" or "NA"? The instructions say "NA" for benign. Since sample 4 is uncertain, maybe "NA" is better. Wait, sample 4 is possibly malignant but not confirmed. The other samples are benign. So the most severe is sample 4, which is uncertain. Since it's not confirmed, the answer should be "no" because there's no definitive malignant finding. Or maybe "NA" if the information is unclear. Hmm. The allowed values are yes, no, NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "no" would be correct. Because "NA" is for when it's not applicable or not mentioned. But here, it's mentioned as a possibility. But since it's not confirmed, the answer is "no". So I think "no" is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignant finding is "no" or uncertain, the Gleason grade should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so even if there was a malignancy, since it's not provided, it's "NA".

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: no
3. Gleason grade: NA
