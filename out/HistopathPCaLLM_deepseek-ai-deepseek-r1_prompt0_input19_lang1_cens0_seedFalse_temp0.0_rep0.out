Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat," which translates to "targeted prostate biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states that in sample 4, there's "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. The other samples (2 and 3) are healthy, and sample 1 is non-representative. Since at least one sample is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report specifies that in sample 4, the major component is Gleason 3 (90%) and minor is Gleason 4 (10%). The correct format is major + minor = sum. So that's 3 + 4 = 7. The other samples don't have malignancies, so only the worst lesion (sample 4) is considered. The Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check the allowed values for each field. Sample type is correct as biopsy. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is properly formatted. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
