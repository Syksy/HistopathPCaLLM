Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat," which translates to "targeted prostate biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). The other samples (2 and 3) are normal, but since at least one sample is malignant, the overall result is positive.

For the Gleason grade, the report states that in sample 4, the majority is Gleason 3 (90%) and a minor part is Gleason 4 (10%). The correct format is "major+minor=sum," so it should be "3+4=7". Even though the percentages are given, the Gleason score is based on the primary and secondary patterns, not the exact percentages. So adding them together gives 3+4=7. The other samples don't have cancer, so only the worst lesion (sample 4) is considered.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. All three fields should be top-level keys. Also, check that the values are exactly as per the allowed options. No typos, and using the specified syntax. Everything seems to fit here. The answer should be a JSON object with these three keys and the determined values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
