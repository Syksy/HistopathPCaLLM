Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat" which translates to "targeted prostate biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states that in sample 4, there's "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. The other samples (2 and 3) are healthy, and sample 1 is non-representative. Since at least one sample is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, but wait, no—Gleason scoring takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. However, in cases where the highest grade is present, even if it's a smaller percentage, the primary is the higher one. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern. Here, Gleason 3 is 90%, and Gleason 4 is 10%. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. The sum is 3+4=7. But the user wants "major+minor=sum" as the format. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the major is the higher grade. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (primary) and the highest grade present (secondary). Wait, no, the standard is primary (most extensive) and secondary (next most extensive). So if the majority is 3 and a smaller part is 4, it's 3+4=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant: yes
3. Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is a top-level key. Also, check that only the worst lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, and its Gleason is 3+4=7, that's the one to report.

```json
{
  "näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
