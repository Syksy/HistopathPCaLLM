Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat," which translates to "targeted prostate biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states that in sample 4, there's "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. The other samples (2 and 3) are healthy, and sample 1 is non-representative. Since at least one sample is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The correct format is "major+minor=sum." The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, but wait, no—Gleason scoring takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. Even though 4 is a higher grade, the primary here is 3 (90%) and secondary is 4 (10%). So it should be 3+4=7. However, the user instructions say to report major+minor=sum. Wait, maybe "major" refers to the higher grade? No, standard Gleason scoring is primary (most common) + secondary (next common), even if secondary is higher. Wait, no—Gleason score is primary pattern (most extensive) plus secondary pattern (second most extensive). If the highest grade is present, even if less extensive, it's considered. Wait, no, the current grading system groups grades into Grade Groups, but the traditional Gleason score is still primary + secondary. In this case, the majority is 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%), so the score is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, and in that sample, the Gleason is 3+4=7. So that's correct.

So putting it all together:

1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant: kyllä
3. Gleason: 3+4=7
