Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since it's clearly a biopsy, the first field should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. The other samples (2 and 3) are healthy, but since at least one sample is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text specifies Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, but wait, no—Gleason scoring takes the most common pattern as the primary grade and the next most common as the secondary. However, if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, the primary is the higher one? Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is primary + secondary, where primary is the most predominant pattern, and secondary is the next most common. But if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the highest grade if it's more than 5%? Wait, I might be mixing up the rules. Let me recall: The current Gleason grading system (since 2016) groups grades into Grade Groups, but the score itself is still the sum of the most common and the highest grade present, if there are multiple. Wait, no. The standard Gleason score is the sum of the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns. However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, but over 5%, it's included. Wait, in this case, the report says "isompi osuus Gleason 3 (90%)" and "pienempi osuus Gleason 4 (10%)". So the primary pattern is 3 (since it's the most extensive), and the secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3 + 4 = 7. So the format should be "major+minor=sum", which here is 4+3=7? Wait, no. Wait, the major is the higher grade if there's a tertiary pattern, but in this case, the major is the most extensive. Wait, no. Let me clarify: The primary Gleason grade is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. So if the majority is 3 (90%) and the secondary is 4 (10%), then the score is 3 + 4 = 7. However, in some cases, if there's a higher grade even in a small amount, but I think in this case, since it's the secondary, it's included. So the correct sum here is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason-luokka should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instruction says "major+minor=sum". Wait, maybe there's a confusion between major and minor. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most extensive, and the secondary (minor) is the next. So in this case, major is 3, minor is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

1. "biopsy"
2. "kyllä"
3. "3+4=7"

I need to make sure that the JSON keys are correct and that the values are exactly as per the allowed options. Also, ensure that there are no nested structures. The answer should be straightforward.
