Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat", which translates to targeted prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report says in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report specifies that in sample 4, the major component is Gleason 3 (90%) and minor is Gleason 4 (10%). The correct format is major + minor = sum. So 3 + 4 = 7. Even though the percentages are given, the Gleason score is based on the sum of the primary and secondary patterns, regardless of their proportions. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion's results are reported. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, its Gleason score is used. The other samples are benign or non-representative, so they don't affect the fields. Also, the sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 3+4=7. All fields are correctly filled without any nesting.
