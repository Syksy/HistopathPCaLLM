Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä" which translates to routinely processed sample type. But the specific type isn't clearly stated. The text refers to samples divided into four parts, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The samples 1-3 are either non-representative or benign. Sample 4 has abnormal architecture, and there's suspicion of possible malignancy ("mahdollisesti malignia"), but it's not confirmed. The pathologist is questioning if it's non-prostatic tissue or truly malignant. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the presence of malignancy isn't definitively yes. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since it's a borderline case and not confirmed, maybe "ei" (no) isn't right either. But the text says "mahdollisesti malignia" which is a suspicion. However, the report hasn't confirmed it yet, so maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, since there's a suspicion, but no definitive diagnosis, maybe NA. Wait, the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" which means the worst lesion's results. If sample 4 is the worst and there's a suspicion, but not confirmed, how to categorize? The presence of malignancy is not confirmed, so maybe "ei" or NA. The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report is uncertain, perhaps NA is appropriate here. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings. If it's only a suspicion and not confirmed, then the answer would be "ei". But the text says "mahdollisesti malignia" which is "possibly malignant". So maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible malignancy. Wait, but the pathologist is questioning whether it's non-prostatic tissue or truly malignant. So it's not confirmed. In such cases, if the report is uncertain, do we consider it as malignant? Probably not. The presence is not confirmed, so the answer would be "ei". But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The key is whether the report states there are malignant findings. If it's uncertain, maybe the answer is NA. But the options are only kyllä, ei, NA. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" but they are checking for possible lab error. So until confirmed, it's not diagnosed as malignant. Therefore, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade would be NA. Even if there was a suspicion, if it's not confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no)
3. Gleason: NA
