Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä" which translates to routinely processed. The text mentions "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" (prostate tissue samples), but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "rajatapauksen verran vähästä riittävään määrää materiaali" suggests it's a borderline case in terms of sample adequacy, but the type isn't specified. So, the sample type is probably NA here.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 has cellular architecture deviating from normal, and there's suspicion of either non-prostatic tissue contamination or possible malignancy ("mahdollisesti malignia"). However, the report states that they need to verify if there was a lab error (labrafiba) before proceeding. Since it's uncertain and pending confirmation, the malignancy isn't confirmed. So, the answer here would be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm malignancy yet. But wait, the text says "mahdollisesti malignia" which is "possibly malignant". However, since it's not confirmed and requires further checks, maybe the answer is still "ei" or "NA"? The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the presence is uncertain and not confirmed, perhaps "ei" is incorrect. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If the suspicion exists but isn't confirmed, maybe it's still considered as "kyllä" because it's a possibility. But the report says they need to check for lab error. Hmm. The key is that the answer should be based on the confirmed findings. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and raises the possibility of contamination, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer would be "ei" because the confirmed samples (1-3) are benign, and sample 4 is uncertain. But the question is about the entire sample. Wait, the samples are divided into four parts. Samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 is suspicious but not confirmed. The worst lesion would be sample 4's finding, but since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if the suspicion is considered as possible malignancy, but the user instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. If the worst is a suspicion, but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä"? This is a bit ambiguous. The report says "mahdollisesti malignia" (possibly malignant), but the lab is checking for errors. Since it's not confirmed, perhaps the answer is "ei". But maybe the presence of suspicious cells is considered as malignant? In pathology, sometimes even suspicious findings might be reported as positive. However, the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's uncertain, maybe the answer is "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's a suspicion, should it be "kyllä" or "ei"? The answer depends on whether the suspicion is enough. Since the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (results of the worst lesion), and the worst here is a possible malignancy, but not confirmed. In medical terms, if a lesion is suspicious but not confirmed, it's not diagnosed as malignant. Therefore, the answer would be "ei". 

Third, the Gleason grade. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason score would be "NA". If there were confirmed malignancy, we would need to report the major + minor = sum. But in this case, since the answer to the second question is "ei" or possibly "NA", the Gleason is "NA".

Wait, but the user instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So, if the sample has malignant findings (kyllä), then Gleason is reported; otherwise, NA. Since in this case, the presence of malignancy is uncertain, but the answer to question 2 is "ei", then Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings: ei (since not confirmed)
3. Gleason: NA
