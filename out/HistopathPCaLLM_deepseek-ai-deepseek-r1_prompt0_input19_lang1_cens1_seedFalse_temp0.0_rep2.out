Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä" which translates to routinely processed. But the original type isn't clearly stated. The text mentions "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" (prostate tissue samples), but without specifying if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't explicitly mentioned.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report says that samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 has "soluarkkitehtuureja, jotka poikkeavat normaalista" (cellular architecture deviating from normal) and mentions "mahdollisesti malignia" (possibly malignant). However, there's uncertainty as they need to check for possible contamination. Since it's not confirmed, but there's suspicion, should I mark it as "kyllä"? Wait, the instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If there's a possibility, but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because it's the worst case? Or does the uncertainty make it NA? The key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" and they are checking for lab error. So it's not confirmed, but the presence is possible. The user wants the worst lesion's results. If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, should we still mark it as "kyllä"? Hmm. The answer might be "kyllä" because it's the worst case mentioned, even if uncertain. But I need to be careful. The sample 4 is under investigation, but the presence is possible. Since the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample, and it's possible, but not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but raises suspicion, perhaps the answer is NA. But the instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If the worst is a possible malignancy, but not confirmed, maybe it's still considered as "kyllä"? Or maybe the answer is NA because it's not confirmed. This is a bit tricky. Let me check the original text again. The report says "mahdollisesti malignia" and they are checking for lab error. So the presence is uncertain. Therefore, the answer for malignancy would be NA because it's not confirmed. But the user wants the worst lesion. If the worst is a possible malignancy, maybe the answer is "kyllä". I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the correct approach is to mark it as "kyllä" because there's a mention of possible malignancy, even if not confirmed. But I need to follow the allowed values strictly. If the sample isn't confirmed, but there's a suspicion, does that count as "kyllä"? The instructions don't specify whether to consider only confirmed cases. Since the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä", if the findings are uncertain, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, if there's any mention, even possible, then "kyllä". I think the answer here is "kyllä" because the worst case is possible malignancy, even if not confirmed. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The sample 4 has cellular changes that could be malignant, but they are checking for lab errors. So the presence is not confirmed. Therefore, the answer might be NA. But the user wants the worst lesion. If the worst is a possible malignancy, then maybe "kyllä". Hmm. This is a tough call. Maybe the answer is "kyllä" because the possibility is mentioned, and the user wants the worst case. 

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is uncertain (if we marked it as "kyllä" or NA), the Gleason would depend on that. If we said "kyllä", then we need to check if a Gleason score is provided. The text doesn't mention Gleason at all. So even if malignancy is "kyllä", the Gleason would be NA. But if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. Wait, the samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 is uncertain. If malignancy is "kyllä" (possible), but no Gleason is reported, then the answer is NA. So regardless, since there's no Gleason mentioned, the answer is NA. 

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignancy: "kyllä" (if considering possible) or NA (if not confirmed). But according to the instructions, take the worst. So "kyllä".
3. Gleason: NA (not mentioned)

But wait, the user's instructions say that for malignant cases, the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If malignancy is "kyllä" but no Gleason is given, then it's NA. So even if malignancy is "kyllä", if Gleason isn't reported, it's NA. So the answer for Gleason is NA regardless.

So final answers:

1. "NA" (sample type not specified)
2. "kyllä" (possible malignancy in sample 4, worst case)
3. "NA" (no Gleason reported)
