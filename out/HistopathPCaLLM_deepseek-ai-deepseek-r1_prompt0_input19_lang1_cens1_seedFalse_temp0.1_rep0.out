Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä" which translates to routinely processed sample type. However, the text doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The examples given (näytteet 1-4) are divided into four parts, but the type isn't specified. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't mentioned.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says that samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 has abnormal architecture, possibly malignant ("mahdollisesti malignia"), but it's questioned whether it's non-prostatic tissue mixed in or truly malignant. Since there's suspicion but no confirmation, and the lab is checking for possible mix-up, it's not confirmed. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The report raises the possibility but doesn't confirm. But the presence of "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings) is uncertain here. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" which is "possibly malignant". Since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. But the question is "oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the report is uncertain, but mentions possible malignancy, does that count as "kyllä"? Or is it NA? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since sample 4 is suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, since there's a suspicion, but no definitive diagnosis, perhaps the presence is not confirmed. But the options don't have 'epävarma', so maybe NA is appropriate here. Hmm. Alternatively, if the possibility is raised, but not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Because the presence isn't definitively stated. So I'll go with NA for question 2.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain (NA in question 2), the Gleason grade would be NA. Even if there was a suspicion, without confirmation of malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So the answer here is NA.

Putting it all together: original type is NA, malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. Wait, but let me check again. The original sample type: the text says "näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä". So they are prostate tissue samples processed routinely. But the type (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't specified. So NA is correct. Malignancy: samples 1-3 are benign, sample 4 is suspicious but not confirmed. Since the worst lesion is considered, and sample 4 is the worst, but it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. If the report can't confirm malignancy, then "ei" would be incorrect because there's a suspicion. But "kyllä" would require confirmation. Since it's uncertain, NA is the safest choice. Gleason grade is then NA as well.
