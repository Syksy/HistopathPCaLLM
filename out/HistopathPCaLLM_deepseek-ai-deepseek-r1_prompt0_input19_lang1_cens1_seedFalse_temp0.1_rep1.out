Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." The term "kudosnäytteitä" translates to tissue samples, which is a bit generic. The report mentions "näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä," which might mean routinely processed, but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). There's no clear indication of the original sample type, so I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report states that samples 1-3 are either non-representative or benign. Sample 4 has cellular architecture deviating from normal, and there's suspicion of possible malignancy ("mahdollisesti malignia"). However, it's questioned whether it's non-prostatic tissue mixed in or truly malignant. Since it's uncertain and requires further verification, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The answer here should be "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy yet, just suspicion. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, maybe "ei" is correct because it's not definitively malignant. Alternatively, if the suspicion is strong enough, maybe "kyllä", but the text says "mahdollisesti" (possibly) and they need to check for lab error. So safer to go with "ei" since it's not confirmed.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (answer to #2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignancy: ei (no confirmed malignancy)
3. Gleason: NA
