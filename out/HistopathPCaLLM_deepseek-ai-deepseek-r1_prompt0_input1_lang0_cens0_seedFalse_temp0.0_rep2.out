Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade. The allowed values for each are specified, so I have to make sure the answers fit those.

Looking at the sample text: "12 representative needle biopsies are being inspected..." The term "needle biopsies" immediately tells me the sample type is "biopsy". That's straightforward for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report mentions "normal glandular structures" and "benign-like growth". The conclusion states "only benign-like growth is observed". So, there's no mention of malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's explicitly stated as benign, the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the tumor is benign, Gleason grade isn't applicable. So, "NA" is correct here.

I need to ensure that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and only includes the most severe lesion. In this case, since there's no malignancy, the most severe is benign, so all answers should reflect that. No Gleason grade needed.

Double-checking the allowed values for each field. Sample type: "biopsy" is valid. Malignant: "no" is allowed. Gleason: "NA" as it's benign. Everything looks good. No typos or misinterpretations. The JSON structure should be flat with these three key-value pairs.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
