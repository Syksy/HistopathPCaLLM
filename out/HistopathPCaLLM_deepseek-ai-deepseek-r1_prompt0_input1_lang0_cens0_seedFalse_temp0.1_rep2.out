Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields required:

1. **Original sample type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the statement, it mentions "12 representative needle biopsies". The term "needle biopsies" clearly indicates the sample type is a biopsy. So the answer here should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states that "only benign-like growth is observed". Since there's no mention of malignancy and it explicitly says benign, the answer here should be "no".

3. **Reported Gleason grade**: This should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the findings are benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. So the answer here is "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's only benign findings mentioned. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any malignancy or Gleason scores. The conclusion clearly states benign, so all three answers are straightforward. No conflicting information here. Everything points to biopsy, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason.
