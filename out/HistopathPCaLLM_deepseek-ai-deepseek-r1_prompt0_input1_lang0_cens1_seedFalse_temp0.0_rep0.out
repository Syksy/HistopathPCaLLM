Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." It mentions samples but doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't there. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says the results are inconclusive and mention needing additional inspection regarding malignancy. Since it's not confirmed, the answer should be NA. Even though it's a prostate cancer sample, the report states the findings are inconclusive, so we can't say yes or no definitively.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. However, the report says the results are inconclusive and that additional inspection is needed for clinically significant Gleason findings. Since there's no mention of specific grades, the answer here is NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since the report is inconclusive, all fields default to NA.
