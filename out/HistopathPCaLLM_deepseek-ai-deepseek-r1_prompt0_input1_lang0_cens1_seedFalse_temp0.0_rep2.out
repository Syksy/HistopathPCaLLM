Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't specify the procedure used to obtain them. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, assessing whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says the results are inconclusive and that additional inspection is required regarding malignancy. Since it's not confirmed, we can't say "yes" or "no". The presence of "mostly normal cell architectures" might suggest no malignancy, but the report explicitly states inconclusive results. Hence, the answer here should be "NA".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is inconclusive and there's a mention of needing further inspection for clinically significant Gleason findings, there's no confirmed Gleason grade reported. So, this field should also be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion's results are considered. However, the statement doesn't describe any specific lesions, just inconclusive findings. Therefore, all fields default to "NA". The JSON should not have nested structures, so each answer is a straightforward key-value pair.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
