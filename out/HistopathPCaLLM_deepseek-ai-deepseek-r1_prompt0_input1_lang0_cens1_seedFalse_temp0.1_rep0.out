Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations" but doesn't specify the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the sample type here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says the results are inconclusive and that additional inspection is needed regarding malignancy. Since it's not confirmed, the answer here should be NA. Even though they mention prostate cancer samples, the inconclusive nature means we can't confirm malignancy from this report.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, and the report states that Gleason findings are still needing inspection, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of specific grades like 3, 4, or 5, so nothing to report here.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no clear severe lesion mentioned. So all fields will be NA.
