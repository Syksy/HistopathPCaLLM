Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, using the allowed values.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the answer here is NA.

Next, were there malignant tumor findings? The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Mostly normal cell architectures" and that the results are inconclusive, needing more inspection regarding malignancy. Since it's inconclusive and no definitive malignant cells are stated, the answer should be NA. It's not yes because they didn't confirm it, and not no because they can't rule it out either.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is inconclusive, there's no Gleason grade reported here. So again, NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but the statement doesn't mention multiple lesions. The JSON should not have nested structures, just flat key-value pairs. Let me double-check each part to ensure compliance with the instructions.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  
1. **Sample type:** No specific procedure (biopsy/RP/TURP) is mentioned in the text.  
2. **Malignancy:** Findings are explicitly stated to be "inconclusive" and requiring additional inspection.  
3. **Gleason grade:** No definitive Gleason grading is reported due to inconclusive malignancy assessment.  

All values default to "NA" as the text lacks definitive information in these categories.
