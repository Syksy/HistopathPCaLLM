Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa," which translates to 12 representative needle biopsies. "Neulabiopsia" is Finnish for needle biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua," meaning the result is mostly benign growth. So, malignant findings are not present. The answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the findings are benign, the Gleason grade should be "NA."

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The sample type is correctly identified as biopsy, malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Benign" here definitely means no malignancy, so all fields are correctly filled.

{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "Gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
