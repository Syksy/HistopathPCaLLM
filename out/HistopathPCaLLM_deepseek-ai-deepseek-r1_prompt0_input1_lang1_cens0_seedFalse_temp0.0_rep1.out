Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa". "Neulabiopsia" translates to needle biopsy in English. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so the malignancy presence is "ei" (no). 

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward: "Alkuperä", "Pahanlaatuisuus", and "Gleason". The values are correctly mapped based on the text. No other information in the report suggests a different interpretation. 

Double-checking the terms: "neulabiopsiaa" definitely refers to biopsy. The findings are benign, so no Gleason score is needed. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Alkuperä": "biopsy",
  "Pahanlaatuisuus": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
