Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa," which translates to 12 representative needle biopsies. "Neulabiopsia" is Finnish for needle biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua," meaning the result is mostly benign growth. So, malignant findings are not present. The answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA." Since the findings are benign, Gleason score isn't applicable. So, "NA."

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. All three fields are top-level. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Benign" definitely means non-malignant. The sample type is clearly biopsy. Everything seems to fit. No Gleason reported here. Alright, ready to format the JSON.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
