Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa," which translates to 12 representative needle biopsies. So "biopsy" is the correct answer here.

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua," meaning the findings are mostly benign. So the answer should be "ei" (no).

Third, the Gleason grade. Since the findings are benign, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So that's straightforward.

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example provided doesn't have any malignant parts, so all fields should be filled accordingly. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm there's no mention of malignancy. The key phrases are "normaaleja rauhasrakenteita" (normal gland structures) and "benignin oloista" (benign-like). No mention of cancer or Gleason patterns. So the JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
