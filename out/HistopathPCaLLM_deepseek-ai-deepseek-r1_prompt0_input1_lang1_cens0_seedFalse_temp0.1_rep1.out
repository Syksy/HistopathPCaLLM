Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." "Neulabiopsiaa" translates to needle biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so the presence of malignant findings is "ei" (no). 

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested elements. The keys are in Finnish as specified. Let me double-check each part. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason NA. That seems right. No mention of any Gleason score because it's benign. All set.

```json
{
  "näytteenAlkuperäinenTyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisiaLöydöksiä": "ei",
  "GleasonLuokka": "NA"
}
