Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." "Neulabiopsiaa" translates to needle biopsy, so the original type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were some findings, since it's benign, we don't report Gleason.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the allowed values. Let me double-check each field. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason NA. That fits all criteria.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
```
