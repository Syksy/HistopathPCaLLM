Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista. Näytteiden yhteismäärä on riittävä." The mention of "prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista" (representative prostate tissue from specified sites) and "näytteiden yhteismäärä" (total amount of samples) suggests this is a biopsy, as RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. The report doesn't mention surgery, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "nähdään mm. rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (gland structures and some wavy epithelium). There's no mention of cancer, just some benign findings. The conclusion is pending, but current findings don't indicate malignancy. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". Even if the conclusion is pending, the current data doesn't show cancer, so Gleason isn't applicable.

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and only the worst lesion is considered. Since there's no cancer, all fields align with "biopsy", "ei", and "NA".

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
