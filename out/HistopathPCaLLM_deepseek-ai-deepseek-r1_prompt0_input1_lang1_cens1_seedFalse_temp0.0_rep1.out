Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The term "sovituista paikoista" might refer to biopsy samples taken from specific locations. The report mentions "näytteiden yhteismäärä on riittävä," which translates to the total number of samples being sufficient. Since there's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), and it's about taking samples from specific spots, the sample type is likely a biopsy. So, the first field should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states "nähdään mm. rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä." Aaltoilevaa epiteeliä (undulating epithelium) can be a benign finding, often seen in conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignancy indicators like infiltration. The conclusion is still pending: "Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken ja valmistuu lähipäivinä." Since the final diagnosis isn't ready, but current findings don't indicate malignancy, the answer here is "ei" (no). However, the report isn't finalized, so maybe "NA"? But the question specifies to report based on existing findings. Since no malignancy is mentioned, "ei" is appropriate.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the current findings don't show malignancy, this should be "NA".

Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grading, and the conclusion is pending. So even if there were some findings, since the report isn't final, maybe Gleason is "NA". But the user's instruction says to report Gleason for malignant cases. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

So the final JSON should be:
{
  "alkupera": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisuus": "ei",
  "gleason": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "alkupera": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisuus": "ei",
  "gleason": "NA"
}
