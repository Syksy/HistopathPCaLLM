Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as "edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista". The term "sovituista paikoista" translates to "from specified locations", which is typical for a biopsy. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (gland structures and some wavy epithelium). Wavy epithelium might refer to benign changes, and there's no explicit mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignancy indicators like Gleason patterns. The conclusion is still pending ("loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so until then, we can't confirm malignancy. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the report doesn't state any malignant features yet and the final conclusion isn't ready, the safest answer here is "ei" (no) because no malignancy is confirmed. But wait, the presence of "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" might be a benign finding. However, the absence of explicit malignant terms like "adenocarcinoma" or Gleason scores suggests no malignancy found so far. So, "ei" is appropriate.

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". Since there's no mention of Gleason patterns or scores in the report, and the conclusion isn't finalized, this should be "NA". Even if there were some findings, without explicit mention, we can't assume. The report is still pending, so no Gleason grade is provided yet.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results are included. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason remains NA. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```

**Perustelut:**
1. Näyte on otettu "sovituista paikoista" (biopsia), eikä tekstissä mainita RP:tä/TURP:ia.
2. Raportissa mainitaan ainoastaan rauhasrakenteita ja lievää aaltoilevaa epiteeliä, mutta ei viitteitä maligniteetista (esim. syöpäsoluja, invaasiota). Lisäksi loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken, mikä viittaa siihen ettei varmaa pahanlaatuisuutta ole vielä raportoitu.
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei voida määrittää, koska raportti ei sisällä Gleason-asteikolla arviointia eikä pahanlaatuisuutta ole havaittu.
