Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista. Näytteiden yhteismäärä on riittävä." The terms here don't clearly indicate a specific procedure. Biopsy usually mentions core samples, RP (radical prostatectomy) would refer to a surgical specimen, and TURP (transurethral resection) might mention resection. Since the text just mentions "prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista" (representative prostate tissue from appropriate sites) without specifying the procedure, I think the original type isn't stated. So NA for the first field.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (gland structures and some wavy epithelium). No mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignant cells. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so there's no definitive diagnosis yet. Therefore, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so the answer should be ei (no) or NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report is pending, maybe NA is better. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. However, if the report is pending, maybe there's no malignancy found yet. But the text doesn't mention any malignant findings. So perhaps the answer is ei (no). But the user might consider that the final conclusion isn't ready, so maybe NA. Hmm. The user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report is pending, maybe they haven't found any yet, so ei. But I need to be careful. The text doesn't state any malignancy, so the answer should be ei. But since the conclusion is pending, maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, the options are for whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the report is pending, maybe they haven't determined it yet, so NA. But the user says to report the worst lesion's results. If the current findings don't show malignancy, then ei. Let me check the text again. It mentions "rauhasrakenteita" (gland structures) and "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (wavy epithelium). Wavy epithelium might be benign. No mention of Gleason or cancer. So likely, no malignancy found so far, but the conclusion is pending. So the answer here would be ei. But since the conclusion isn't final, maybe NA. The user's instruction says "näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – if the sample has malignant findings, then kyllä. If not, ei. If uncertain, NA. Since the report is pending, but current findings don't indicate malignancy, perhaps ei. But maybe the system expects NA here because the conclusion isn't final. This is a bit ambiguous. The user's example might help. Let me think of similar cases. If the report is pending, but no malignancy is mentioned yet, then ei. But if the conclusion is pending, maybe the presence is not determined, hence NA. I'm a bit torn here. The user's instruction says to consider the worst lesion. If no malignancy is found in the current findings, then ei. But if the conclusion is pending, maybe they are waiting for further analysis. However, the user wants the worst lesion's results. If nothing is found, then ei. So I'll go with ei.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is ei, the Gleason would be NA. Even if the conclusion is pending, if no malignancy is detected, then Gleason is NA.

So the final JSON would be:
{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
