Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista. Näytteiden yhteismäärä on riittävä." The terms here mention "prostatakudosta" (prostate tissue) and "näytteiden yhteismäärä" (total number of samples). However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the original type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, presence of malignant findings. The text states: "Nähdään mm. rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä." Rauhastruktuureita are glandular structures, and aaltoilevaa epiteeliä (undulating epithelium) might be benign or reactive changes. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignancy. The conclusion is still pending: "Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken ja valmistuu lähipäivinä." So the final diagnosis isn't ready yet. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy in the current findings, the answer should be "ei" (no), but wait—the report is still pending. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the conclusion isn't finalized, but the current findings don't mention malignancy, maybe it's safer to put "ei" because the visible structures are benign. But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the report is pending, maybe the presence isn't confirmed yet. Hmm. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. If the report is pending, perhaps the presence is not determined yet, so NA? But the user says to process based on the given text. The text doesn't mention malignancy, so maybe "ei". But I need to be careful. The user might consider pending as NA. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report is pending, maybe the answer is NA. But the visible findings are benign. So perhaps "ei". But the final conclusion isn't ready. However, the current findings don't show malignancy, so the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA.

So the structured data would be:
1. NA
2. ei
3. NA
