Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy is RP, that's the first field done.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The sample states "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text has two parts: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, 4+4 is higher. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Check allowed values again. All answers fit: RP, yes, 4+4=8. No issues here.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
