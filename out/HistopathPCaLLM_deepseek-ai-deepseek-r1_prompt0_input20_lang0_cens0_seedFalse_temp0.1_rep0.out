Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." I know that RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the answer here should be "RP". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The sample mentions "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes". The options are yes, no, or NA. Easy enough.

Third, Gleason grade. The text has two parts: the apex shows Gleason 3+4, and the basis has 4+4. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher sum is 8. But also, the highest individual grade is considered for severity. Since 4+4 is a higher grade (both being 4), that's more severe. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8". The format should be major+minor=sum as whole numbers. So that's correct.

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in JSON. The keys are the three fields, each with their respective values. Check allowed values again to confirm. All looks good. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 4+4=8. So the JSON should be valid with those entries.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
