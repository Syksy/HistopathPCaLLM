Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." I know that RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the answer here should be "RP".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The sample mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So the answer is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the text has two parts: Gleason 3+4 at the apex and 4+4 at the basis. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, 4+4 is worse. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Also, check allowed values. All answers fit: RP, yes, and the Gleason format. No issues here. So the final JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```
