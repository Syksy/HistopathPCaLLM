Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." That sounds like a biopsy since they're taking samples from different regions, but the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, terms like "samples" might suggest biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's safer to put NA here because it's not clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." So they can't determine if there's adenocarcinoma because the samples are compromised. The mention of "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found" suggests that even if there were, it's hypothetical. Since they can't confirm, the answer here should be NA, not yes or no.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is NA, the Gleason should also be NA. Even though they mention 3+4 hypothetically, the actual report can't confirm malignancy, so we don't use that value.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and only the most severe lesion is considered. The text doesn't mention any confirmed lesions, so all fields are NA.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
