Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." That sounds like a biopsy since they're taking samples from different regions. But I need to be careful. The text also talks about therapies affecting the samples, but the method of obtaining isn't explicitly stated. However, the mention of multiple samples from different regions of the prostate is more indicative of a biopsy procedure. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." So they can't determine if there's adenocarcinoma because the samples are too damaged. The hypothetical mentions "if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found," but that's a hypothetical scenario. Since the actual examination couldn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "no" because there's no confirmation of malignancy. Wait, but "no" would mean they checked and found no malignancy. However, the text says it's impossible to examine, so maybe "NA" is more appropriate. But the options are yes, no, or NA. Since the examination couldn't be done, maybe "NA" is correct here. But the user instructions say "NA" for benign statements. Hmm. If the sample is too damaged to assess, does that count as "NA"? The presence of malignant tumor isn't determined, so maybe "NA" is better. But the user might expect "no" if there's no evidence. Wait, the text says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies," meaning they can't confirm. So the answer here is "no" because there's no evidence found, but the reason is that it's impossible to examine. Alternatively, maybe "NA" because the assessment wasn't possible. This is a bit tricky. The user's allowed values for malignant findings: "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the report states that examination is impossible, maybe "NA" is the right choice here because the presence couldn't be determined. So I'll go with "NA" for the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The text mentions a hypothetical scenario of "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clarifies that even if that were found, the treatment would focus elsewhere. Since this is a hypothetical and not an actual finding, the actual Gleason grade isn't reported. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy, and the Gleason mentioned is just a possibility, not an actual result. So the third field is "NA".

Putting it all together: original sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are NA, Gleason grade is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Let me double-check each part. The sample type: biopsy. Malignant: NA because couldn't assess. Gleason: NA. Yes, that seems right.
