Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't explicitly mentioned. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions that even if a lower Gleason like 3+4 were found, the focus is on other treatments. Since they can't confirm adenocarcinoma because of prior therapies affecting the samples, there's no clear evidence of malignancy. So the answer here should be no. Wait, but maybe the uncertainty means it's NA? Hmm. The key part is "impossible due to therapies" which means they can't determine it. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't examine, does that mean the result is inconclusive? The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the exam was impossible, maybe NA is better. Wait, the user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if the exam couldn't be done, maybe the answer is NA. But the text also says "even in the hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found..." which implies that even if there was a finding, it's hypothetical. So the actual findings are not confirmed. So maybe the answer is no, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the exam was impossible, maybe NA. Hmm. Let me check again. The presence of malignant tumor is asked. If the exam couldn't be performed, then the answer might be NA. But the user instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the findings couldn't be determined, then NA. So I think NA is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions a hypothetical scenario of 3+4, but that's not an actual finding. Since they couldn't examine due to therapies, there's no reported Gleason. So the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the user said to take the most severe lesion. However, in this case, there's no lesion reported because the samples are too affected. So all answers would be NA. Let me confirm again. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" so no malignant findings can be confirmed. Therefore, malignant findings would be "no"? Or is it NA because it's unknown? The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the exam couldn't be done, then it's not possible to determine, so NA. But if the result is that no malignancy was found, then no. The text doesn't say they found no malignancy, just that they couldn't examine it. So NA is more accurate. Therefore, all three fields would be NA. But let me check the sample type again. The samples are prostate tissue divided into apex, middle, and basis. That sounds like a biopsy, but maybe it's from a TURP or RP. Without explicit terms, it's safer to put NA. So final answers: all NA.
