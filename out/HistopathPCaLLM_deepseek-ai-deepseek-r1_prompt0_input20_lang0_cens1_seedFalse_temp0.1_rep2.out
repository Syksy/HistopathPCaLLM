Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't there. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions that even if a lower Gleason like 3+4 were found, the focus is on other treatments. Since they can't confirm adenocarcinoma due to therapy effects, but there's a hypothetical mention of Gleason, it's unclear. However, the key point is that the examination is impossible, so there's no confirmation of malignancy. So maybe "no" or "NA". Wait, but the presence of a hypothetical Gleason might suggest malignancy. Hmm. But the actual findings are impossible, so maybe the answer is "no" because they can't confirm malignancy, or "NA" because it's uncertain. The instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. Since they can't confirm, maybe "NA" is safer. But the user says if the most severe lesion is considered, but the text doesn't confirm any malignancy. So perhaps "no" if they didn't find any, but the text says "impossible to examine". Maybe "NA" is better here.

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions a hypothetical lower level like 3+4, but states that even if found, it's not prioritized. Since it's hypothetical and not confirmed, the actual report doesn't provide a Gleason grade. So the answer should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the user says to take the most severe lesion. If the hypothetical Gleason 3+4 is mentioned, does that count? The note says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". But the text says that even if a lower Gleason were found, it's hypothetical. Since the examination is impossible, the actual report doesn't have a confirmed Gleason. So Gleason should be NA. Malignant findings would be "no" if they didn't find any, but the text says they can't examine due to therapies. So maybe "NA" for malignant as well. Original sample type is definitely NA because it's not specified.
