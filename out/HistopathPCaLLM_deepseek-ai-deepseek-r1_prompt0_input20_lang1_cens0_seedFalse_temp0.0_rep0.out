Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to prostatectomy resection. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the first field should be "RP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is a type of cancer. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states two findings: Gleason 3+4 in the apex and 4+4 in the basis. The instruction says to take the worst lesion's result. Gleason 4+4 is higher than 3+4, so the correct grade is "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. Also, since there are malignant findings, Gleason can't be NA. 

Double-checking the sample type: prostatectomy resection is indeed RP. Malignancy is confirmed. The highest Gleason is 4+4. All fields are correctly filled as per the allowed values. No issues here.
