Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to prostatectomy resection specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that adenokarsinoomaa (adenocarcinoma) was found in samples from both the apex and the base. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions two different scores: Gleason 3+4 in the apex and 4+4 in the base. The instructions specify to report the worst lesion's result. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher grade is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the three fields. Also, the values must be in the specified formats. Let me double-check each part:

1. Sample type: "prostatektomiaresekaatti" maps to RP. Correct.
2. Malignancy: Adenocarcinoma present. So "kyllä". Correct.
3. Gleason: The worst is 4+4=8. So "4+4=8". Correct.

No issues with the required syntax. All values fit the allowed options. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+4=8"
}
