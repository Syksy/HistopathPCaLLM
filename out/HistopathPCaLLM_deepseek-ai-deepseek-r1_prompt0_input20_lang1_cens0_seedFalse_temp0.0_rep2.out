Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" refers to prostatectomy. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" likely means a radical prostatectomy specimen, so RP is the correct choice here.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text says "löytyy adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions two areas: apex with Gleason 3+4 and basis with 4+4. The instructions specify to take the worst lesion. Gleason grading considers the primary and secondary patterns, and the highest sum is the worst. 4+4=8 is worse than 3+4=7. So the major is 4, minor 4, sum 8. The format should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst Gleason is reported. Also, check the allowed values for each field. Everything seems to fit. No issues with margins or extracapsular extension mentioned, but those aren't part of the required fields. So the final JSON should have RP, kyllä, and 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+4=8"
}
