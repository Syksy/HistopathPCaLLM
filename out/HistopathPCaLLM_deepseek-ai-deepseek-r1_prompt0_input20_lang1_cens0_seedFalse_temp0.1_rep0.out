Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, so the sample type here is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "löytyy adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text has two parts: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. Since we need the worst (pahimman) lesion, the highest sum is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are direct. Also, since there are malignant findings, Gleason isn't "NA". The sample type is correctly mapped to "RP", and malignancy is confirmed. All required fields are covered.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
