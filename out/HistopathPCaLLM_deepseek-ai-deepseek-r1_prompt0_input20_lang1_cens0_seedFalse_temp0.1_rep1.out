Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, so the sample type here is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "löytyy adenokarsinoomaa", which translates to adenocarcinoma found. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text has two mentions: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. Since we need the worst (pahin) lesion, the highest sum is 4+4=8. But the instructions specify the format "major+minor=sum". So it should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, the sample type is correctly mapped to "RP", malignancy is "kyllä", and Gleason is "4+4=8". No other values are needed. Let me double-check the original text for any possible errors. The margins are clean, but that doesn't affect malignancy presence. The key points are covered. Looks good.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
