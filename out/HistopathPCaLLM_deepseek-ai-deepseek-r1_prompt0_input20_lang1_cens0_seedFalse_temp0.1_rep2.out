Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to fill are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so this should be "RP". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report says "löytyy adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text has two parts: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. The instruction says to take the worst (pahimman) lesion. Gleason 4+4 is worse than 3+4, so the major is 4 and minor is 4, sum 8. The format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the worst Gleason is reported. The other points like no extracapsular extension or clean margins don't affect these fields. 

Double-checking the sample type: prostatektomiaresecaatti is indeed RP. Malignancy is present. Gleason highest is 4+4=8. All set.
