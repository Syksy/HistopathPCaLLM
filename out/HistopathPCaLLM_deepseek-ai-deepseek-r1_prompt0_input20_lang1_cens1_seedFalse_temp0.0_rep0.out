Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" (prostate tissue samples) and talks about dividing them into six parts. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP. The text also says that the samples are difficult to assess due to prior treatments, which might suggest biopsy samples. But the exact type isn't clear. Since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" (evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible) because the samples are altered. Even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, it's hypothetical. So, the actual presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The report doesn't state any definite malignant findings, so the answer here might be "ei" (no) or NA. But since they couldn't assess due to treatment effects, maybe "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy.

For Gleason grade, the example given is hypothetical ("hypoteettisessa tilanteessa... Gleason 3+4"). Since the actual samples couldn't be evaluated, there's no reported Gleason. So the answer here should be NA.

Wait, but the instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. If the malignancy is uncertain, but they couldn't assess, maybe the presence is NA? Hmm. The question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the evaluation is impossible, does that mean the answer is NA? The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report says they can't assess due to altered samples, maybe the presence is NA. But the user might consider that if no malignancy was found, it's "ei". But the text says they can't evaluate, so maybe NA is better here.

Original sample type: The text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just mentions "näytteet" (samples). So NA.

Malignant findings: Since evaluation is impossible, and no confirmed malignancy, but the hypothetical mentions a possible Gleason, but it's not actual. So NA.

Gleason grade: Since no actual malignancy was found, and the Gleason mentioned is hypothetical, the answer is NA.

So the structured data would be:

1. NA
2. NA
3. NA

But wait, the user said to take into account that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the answer shouldn't have nested structures. Let me recheck the text.

The report states that due to local treatments, the prostate samples are clearly altered, making assessment of possible adenocarcinoma impossible. Even if a low-grade Gleason (3+4) were found hypothetically, they prioritize ongoing treatments. So, in reality, no Gleason is reported because the samples are not evaluable. Therefore, malignancy presence is not confirmed, so maybe "ei" (no) or NA. But since they can't assess, NA is more accurate.

Original sample type: The text mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" but doesn't specify the procedure. So NA.

Malignant findings: Since they can't assess, but there's no mention of confirmed malignancy, maybe NA. If the answer options allow NA when uncertain, then NA. If the presence is determined based on what's found, and nothing is found, then "ei". But the text says evaluation is impossible, so NA is better.

Gleason: NA because no malignancy was confirmed.

So final answers:

1. "NA"
2. "NA"
3. "NA"
