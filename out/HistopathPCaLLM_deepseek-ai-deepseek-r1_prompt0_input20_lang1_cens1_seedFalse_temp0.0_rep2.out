Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break down the text step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The report talks about dividing the samples into six parts, but there's no explicit mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like TURP or biopsy aren't present. The text also mentions that the samples are altered due to prior treatments, but that doesn't specify the original type. So, since the original procedure isn't stated, I should put NA here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says that evaluating adenocarcinoma is impossible because the samples are clearly altered by local treatments. However, there's a hypothetical mention of a low-grade Gleason (3+4) being found. But the key here is whether there are actual malignant findings. The report states that even if such a Gleason score were found, current treatments would be prioritized. Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain due to altered samples and the Gleason mention is hypothetical, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the actual evaluation couldn't confirm malignancy. Alternatively, if the hypothetical is considered, but the text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" (evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible), so the conclusion is no confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the report mentions a hypothetical Gleason 3+4, but the actual evaluation couldn't confirm malignancy due to altered samples, the Gleason score isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer here is NA. Even though there's a mention of 3+4, it's in a hypothetical context, not an actual finding. So the malignancy is not confirmed, hence Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results are considered. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason remains NA.
