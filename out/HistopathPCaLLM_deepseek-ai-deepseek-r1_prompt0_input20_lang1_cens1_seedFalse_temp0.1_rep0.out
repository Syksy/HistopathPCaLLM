Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. However, the specific procedure isn't clearly stated. Terms like "näytteiden shiftailu" (sample shifting) and "kerätä uusiksi" (collect again) suggest that the samples might be biopsies, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type is probably NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which means assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments that have altered the samples. Since they can't confirm malignancy because the samples are transformed, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it's uncertain, maybe "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy, but the text says it's impossible to assess. Wait, the user instructions say if there are no malignant findings, use "ei". But here, they can't assess due to altered samples. So maybe "ei" isn't correct. The options are only kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and states it's impossible to evaluate, perhaps the answer is "ei" because there's no evidence of malignancy found. Alternatively, maybe NA. Hmm. The key is whether the sample has malignant findings. The text says the samples are transformed, making assessment impossible. So they can't determine if there's malignancy. In that case, maybe the answer is NA because it's not possible to assess. But the user's instruction says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – if the sample has malignant findings. Since the assessment is impossible, maybe the answer is "ei" because no malignant findings were identified, but the reason is due to sample issues. Or is it NA? The user might consider that if the presence can't be determined, then NA is appropriate. I think NA is better here because the report states that evaluation isn't possible, so we can't say yes or no.

Third, the Gleason grade. The text mentions a hypothetical situation where even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, they would prioritize ongoing treatments. But this is a hypothetical scenario, not an actual finding. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. The actual report doesn't state any Gleason score because they couldn't assess due to altered samples. So the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but let me double-check. The sample type: the text mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" but doesn't specify the procedure. So unless there's a term like TURP or biopsy mentioned, it's NA. The presence of malignancy: since they can't assess, maybe NA. Gleason: definitely NA because it's hypothetical. So the final answers would be all NAs. But wait, the user says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – so if there's any mention of possible malignancy, but in this case, it's impossible to assess. So maybe malignancy is NA. Yes, that makes sense.
