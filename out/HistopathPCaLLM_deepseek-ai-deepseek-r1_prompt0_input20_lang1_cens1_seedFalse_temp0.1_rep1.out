Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The text also talks about dividing the samples into six parts from apex to base, which sounds more like a biopsy procedure. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "näytteet kerätä uusiksi" suggests that samples were taken, possibly via biopsy, but since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the safest answer here is NA.

Next, the presence of malignancy. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which means assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments that have altered the samples. Even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, the focus would be on ongoing treatments. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to altered samples, the answer here might be "ei" (no) because they can't confirm it, but wait. The question is whether there were malignant findings. The text says that even if there were, it's impossible to assess. So the actual presence isn't confirmed. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report states that assessment is impossible, maybe the answer is NA. But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. However, in this case, they can't assess due to treatment effects, so maybe the presence is NA. Hmm, tricky. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which implies that they can't determine if there's malignancy. So the answer here would be NA because it's uncertain.

Third, Gleason grade. The example given is hypothetical: "vaikka matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4) löytyisi" – even if a low-grade Gleason like 3+4 were found. But this is a hypothetical scenario, not an actual finding. Since the actual samples can't be assessed, the Gleason grade isn't reported. So the answer here is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA because it's not explicitly stated, malignancy is NA because assessment isn't possible, and Gleason is NA because it's hypothetical.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Tekstissä ei mainita eksplisiittisesti näytteen alkuperää (esim. "biopsia", "RP" tai "TURP"), vaan viitataan yleisesti "eturauhaskudoksen näytteisiin".  
2. Pahanlaatuisuutta ei voida vahvistaa, koska raportin mukaan mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on **mahdotonta** hoitojen aiheuttaman kudoksen muutoksen vuoksi. Hypoteettinen Gleason-luokitus (3+4) on esitetty ehdollisena skenaariona, ei todellisena löydöksenä.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei raportoida, koska näytteet eivät salli luotettavaa arviointia (ei todellisia pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä).
