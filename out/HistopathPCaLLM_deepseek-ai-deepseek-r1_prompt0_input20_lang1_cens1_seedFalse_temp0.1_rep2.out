Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the mention is "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet jaetaan kuuteen pääsettiin yltäen apeksista, keskialueesta, aina basiksen alueelle." The term "pääsettiin" might be a typo, possibly meaning "pääsettiin" isn't clear. However, the description of dividing the samples into six parts from apex to base sounds more like a biopsy procedure where multiple cores are taken. RP and TURP are more extensive procedures. The text doesn't mention surgery like prostatectomy or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta johtuen paikallisista hoidoista, sillä eturauhasen kudosnäytteet ovat selkeästi muuntuneita." This translates to the assessment of possible adenocarcinoma being impossible due to local treatments, and the samples are altered. Since they can't confirm malignancy because of treatment effects, but there's a hypothetical mention of Gleason 3+4, but it's not confirmed. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states that evaluation is impossible, and the samples are altered, it's not possible to determine malignancy. But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. However, in this case, even if there's a hypothetical Gleason mentioned, it's not a confirmed finding. So maybe "ei" (no) because they can't confirm malignancy, but the presence is uncertain. Wait, the options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since the report says the assessment is impossible, maybe "NA" is more appropriate here. But the user says to take into account the worst lesion. The text mentions that even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, they would prioritize ongoing treatments. But this is a hypothetical scenario. So actual findings don't confirm malignancy. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, so the answer should be "ei" or "NA"? The key is whether there are any confirmed malignant findings. Since the samples are too altered to assess, the presence can't be determined. So maybe "NA" is correct here. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If the worst lesion is indeterminate, then perhaps "NA". Alternatively, if the report states that malignancy can't be assessed, but there's no evidence of it, maybe "ei". Hmm. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" – evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible. So the presence is uncertain. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text mentions a hypothetical situation: "hypoteettisessa tilanteessa jos vaikka matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4) löytyisi". This is a hypothetical, not an actual finding. Since the actual samples can't be assessed due to treatment effects, there's no confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy presence is NA (since it's indeterminate), and Gleason is NA.
