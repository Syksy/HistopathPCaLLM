Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing tissue from the prostate, often resulting in chips. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth," "nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth and nuclear atypia are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. The preferred format is major + minor = sum. So major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account. Since the highest Gleason here is 5+4=9, that's the one to report. Also, check that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the allowed values correctly. All seems good. No NA needed here since all information is present.

{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
