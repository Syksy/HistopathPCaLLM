Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing tissue from the prostate, often resulting in chips. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth," "nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth and nuclear atypia are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. The structured format should be "major+minor=sum," so 5+4=9. Since this is a malignant case, we report the sum. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The highest Gleason here is 5+4=9, so that's correct. All fields are filled without using NA. Double-checking the terms to ensure accuracy. Yep, TURP is correct for the sample type. Malignant is yes. Gleason 5+4=9. All set.
