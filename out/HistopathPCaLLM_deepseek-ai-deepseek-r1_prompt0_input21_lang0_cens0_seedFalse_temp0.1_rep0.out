Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they want. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

Starting with the first field: original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the sample is described as "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often resulting in chips or shavings. So I'll go with TURP here.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Additionally, the presence of Gleason grading (which is used for cancer) supports malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text states "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." In Gleason scoring, the primary (most common) and secondary (second most common) grades are added. So primary 5 and secondary 4 would be 5+4=9. The structured format should be "5+4=9".

Now, I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report mentions the most common Gleason is 5, which is higher than 4, that's the primary. The sum is 9, which is correct. There's no mention of other lesions that might be more severe, so this is the one to report.

Putting it all together into JSON without nested structures. Checking each field again:

1. Original sample type: TURP
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 5+4=9

No nested structures here, each field is a top-level key. Validating the JSON syntax to ensure there are no errors. Looks good.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```
