Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The given text starts with "Prostate chippings total approx 19g...". The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue in chips. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report mentions "poorly differentiated growth" which is a sign of malignancy. Also, nuclei are described as enlarged with visible nucleoli, which are characteristics of cancer cells. Additionally, it talks about tumor-like tissue and Gleason grading, which is used for prostate cancer. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. Gleason grades are typically reported as major + minor = sum. So here, major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the highest Gleason grade mentioned is 5+4=9, that's the one to report. The JSON should not have nested structures, so each answer is a separate key-value pair. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. No typos, and valid JSON syntax.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
