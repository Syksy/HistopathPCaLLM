Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The given text starts with "Prostate chippings total approx 19g...". The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often resulting in chips or shavings. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth" which is a sign of malignancy. Also, nuclei with visible nucleoli and variation in size are indicators of cancer. The presence of tumor-like tissue and Gleason grading further supports malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. The standard format is major + minor = sum. So Gleason 5 + 4 = 9. Even though the order is mentioned as most common 5 and second 4, the major is the higher grade. Wait, no—Gleason scoring takes the primary (most extensive) pattern and the secondary (next most extensive). However, if the highest grade is present, even if less extensive, it's considered. But in this case, the most common is 5, so primary is 5, secondary is 4. So the sum is 5+4=9. The answer should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which aligns with the highest grade being 5+4=9. So the structured JSON should have the three fields with these values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
