Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece..." The mention of "fragments" and the size suggests it's a biopsy. TURP usually involves removing larger amounts of tissue, often for relieving symptoms, but here it's fragments, so biopsy seems more likely. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth," which might be concerning. However, it also states that the nuclei are dissolved and there's technical noise affecting the assessment. The report also says that about half the area is too noisy and additional QC is needed. Since the assessment is confounded and they can't properly evaluate the differentiation, there's no clear confirmation of malignancy. So the answer here should be "NA" because the presence of malignant cells can't be determined due to the technical issues.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (we put NA for the second field), the Gleason grade should also be "NA". Even if there were some growth patterns mentioned, the noise and technical issues prevent a reliable assessment. So no Gleason score can be reported here.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have biopsy for sample type, NA for malignancy, and NA for Gleason grade. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without any nested structures and only includes the most severe lesion's results, which in this case isn't determinable due to the sample quality.
