Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "fragments" often refers to TURP specimens because TURP typically yields multiple small pieces. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and fewer. RP would be a whole prostate, which isn't the case here. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth," which might be descriptive terms. However, it also states that the nuclei are dissolved and there's technical noise affecting the assessment. There's no clear mention of malignancy like "carcinoma" or "malignant cells." The uncertainty due to technical issues might lead to "no" because they can't confirm malignancy, but the presence of "carpet-like growth" could be a red flag. Wait, "carpet-like growth" is sometimes associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is non-cancerous. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and mentions technical difficulties, the answer here should be "no" or maybe "NA". But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy and the assessment is confounded, maybe "no" is safer. Alternatively, if the presence of growth is suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "NA" because it's uncertain. Hmm, the instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if they can't assess due to noise, maybe they didn't find any definite malignancy. So "no" might be appropriate. Or perhaps "NA" if the data is insufficient. The key is whether the report states any malignant findings. Since it doesn't, and the assessment is hindered, maybe "no" is correct. But I need to be careful here. If the report doesn't mention malignancy, the answer is "no". If it's uncertain, maybe "NA". The statement says "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." So they can't assess properly. In that case, maybe the answer is "NA" because the presence can't be determined. Wait, the allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't state malignancy and the assessment is unclear, then "NA" would be appropriate. Because "no" would mean they checked and found no malignancy, but here they couldn't assess properly. So "NA" is better here.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignant finding is "NA" (as per previous step), the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there was a mention, if the assessment is hindered, they wouldn't report a Gleason score. The text doesn't mention any Gleason components, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but earlier I thought sample type is TURP. Let me check again. The sample is "extracted prostate material" as fragments. TURP is a procedure where they remove parts of the prostate, often in fragments. Biopsy is usually core needle biopsies, which are smaller and cylindrical. RP is the entire prostate. So TURP makes sense here. So original sample type is TURP. Malignant findings: since they can't assess due to technical issues, and there's no explicit mention of malignancy, the answer is "NA". Gleason grade is "NA" because no malignancy is confirmed. So the final JSON should have TURP, NA, NA.
