Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "fragments" often relates to TURP specimens, as TURP typically results in multiple tissue fragments. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and fewer. RP would be a whole prostate, which isn't indicated here. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth," but then says the nuclei are dissolved and there's technical noise affecting assessment. There's no clear mention of malignancy. Terms like "carpet-like growth" might suggest hyperplasia, which is benign. Since the assessment is confounded and they mention needing additional QC, there's no definitive evidence of malignancy. So the answer here would be no. Wait, but the user says to take the most severe lesion. If there's uncertainty, maybe NA? But the options are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions growth patterns that could be benign, maybe the answer is no. Alternatively, if the assessment is inconclusive due to noise, maybe NA. Hmm. The statement says "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." So they can't assess properly. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed. The options are yes, no, or NA. Since the assessment is hindered, maybe NA is appropriate here. But the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." If the most severe lesion mentioned is benign, then no. But if the data is insufficient, then NA. I think NA is better here because the assessment is confounded, so they can't determine malignancy. So answer NA for the second field.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is NA (as per previous step), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there was a mention, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't applicable. So NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the sample type: TURP is correct? The fragments and size mentioned are typical for TURP. Yes. So the JSON should be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and the values are correct. The answer seems to fit the criteria.
