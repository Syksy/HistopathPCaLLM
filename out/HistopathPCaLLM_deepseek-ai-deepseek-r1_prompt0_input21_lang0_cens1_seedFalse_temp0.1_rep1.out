Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "fragments" often relates to TURP specimens because TURP typically yields multiple tissue fragments. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and more core-like. RP would be a whole prostate, so that's not the case here. So, I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed." Carpet-like growth might refer to a growth pattern, but the key here is whether malignancy is confirmed. However, the nuclei are dissolved, and there's technical noise affecting the assessment. The report also mentions that half the area is too noisy and additional QC is needed. Since the assessment is confounded and they can't confirm cell differentiation, there's no clear mention of malignancy. So, the answer here should be "no" because they can't confirm malignancy due to technical issues. Wait, but allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the presence can't be determined due to noise, maybe NA? But the question is "were there malignant findings?" If the report doesn't confirm it, maybe "no" is safer. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The statement doesn't explicitly state malignancy, just mentions growth patterns but with technical issues. Since they can't assess properly, maybe the answer is "NA" because it's not possible to determine. Hmm, but the allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the sample is inadequate, does that count as NA? The instructions say "NA" for benign in Gleason, but for malignant findings, maybe if it's uncertain, it's NA. But the user says "were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report doesn't confirm it, perhaps the answer is "no" because they didn't find definitive evidence. Alternatively, if the sample is insufficient, maybe NA. The example in the problem statement might help. Wait, the example given in the problem statement's sample input isn't here. Let me think again. The statement says "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." So they can't assess properly. Therefore, they can't confirm presence or absence. So maybe the answer is "NA" for malignant findings. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. So if the assessment is inconclusive, NA would be appropriate here. So I'll put "NA" for the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed (or the assessment is hindered), and the Gleason score is only reported for malignant cases, the answer here should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grading because they couldn't assess differentiation due to technical issues. So definitely "NA" for the third field.

Putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the user said "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." However, in this case, there's no mention of any lesions, just technical issues. So maybe the most severe lesion isn't present here. But the sample type is TURP, which is correct. Malignant findings are NA because they can't assess. Gleason is NA. So the final JSON should be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, with quotes and commas correctly placed. Also, check that the allowed values are respected. Yes, TURP is allowed, NA for the others. This should be correct.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
``` 

**Explanation**:  
1. **Original sample type**: "TURP" is inferred from the description of "several fragments" of prostate material, which aligns with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens.  
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: "NA" because technical noise and dissolved nuclei prevent definitive assessment of malignancy.  
3. **Reported Gleason grade**: "NA" as no Gleason grading is possible due to insufficient diagnostic quality of the material.
