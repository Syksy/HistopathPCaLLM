Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "fragments" often refers to TURP specimens because TURP typically yields multiple fragments. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and more numerous, but the mention of fragments here leans more towards TURP. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed," but then mentions technical noise affecting the assessment. Carpet-like growth might be a term used for certain growth patterns, but without clear evidence of malignancy (like invasion or specific grading), and considering the technical issues mentioned, it's uncertain. Since the noise confounds the assessment, there's no definitive mention of malignancy. So the answer here should be NA because the presence can't be confirmed due to technical limitations.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (we put NA for the second field), the Gleason grade should also be NA. Even if there were some growth mentioned, without clear differentiation into Gleason patterns, and given the technical noise, it's impossible to assign a grade here.

So putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignant findings are NA, and Gleason grade is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check each part again. The fragments point to TURP, the uncertainty due to technical issues leads to NA for malignancy and Gleason. Yep, that seems right.
