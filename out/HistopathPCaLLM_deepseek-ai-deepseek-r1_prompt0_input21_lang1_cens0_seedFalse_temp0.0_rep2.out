Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is referred to as "Prostatalastuja" which translates to prostate chips or fragments. TURP procedures typically produce such chips, so the type here is likely TURP.

Next, I need to check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "paljon fibromuskulaaria stroomaa ja mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua stroomassa" which includes poorly differentiated growth, a sign of malignancy. Also, there's a mention of "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) with Gleason grading. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. Since the sample has tumor tissue with Gleason 5 and 4, that's the major and minor components. The structured JSON should have these values without nested structures. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "5+4=9"
}
```
