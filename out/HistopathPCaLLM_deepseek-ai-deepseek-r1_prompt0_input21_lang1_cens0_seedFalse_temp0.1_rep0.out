Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break down the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The text describes "mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" which means poorly differentiated growth, and mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue). These are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported and no nested structures. All the required fields are covered, and the values fit the allowed options. No other information in the text contradicts these conclusions. So the final JSON should reflect these points accurately.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "5+4=9"
}
```
