Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is referred to as "Prostatalastuja" which translates to prostate chips or fragments. TURP procedures typically produce such chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, I need to check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "paljon fibromuskulaaria stroomaa ja mattomaista huonosti erilaistunetta kasvua" which includes poorly differentiated growth, and mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue). The presence of tumor tissue and Gleason grading indicates malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states that the most is grade 5 and the second most is grade 4. So major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. "Prostatalastuja" is indeed typical for TURP. The malignancy is confirmed by tumor tissue and Gleason grades. The Gleason components are clearly stated as 5 and 4. All seems correct.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "5+4=9"
}
