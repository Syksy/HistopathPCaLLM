Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale..." The term "fragmentti" (fragment) suggests that it's not a whole prostate removal (RP) or TURP, which are specific procedures. Biopsy samples are often fragmented. So I think the original type here is "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" (stroma and mat-like growth are seen), but "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical noise complicates assessing differentiation. The presence of growth might suggest a tumor, but the faded nuclei and technical issues make it unclear. However, the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy. Since there's no definitive mention of cancer, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". But wait, "mattomaista kasvua" could be neoplastic. However, without clear malignancy stated, and considering the technical difficulties, it's safer to say "ei" or maybe "NA". But the user wants "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct. But I'm a bit uncertain here. Let me check again. The text says "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" – stroma is normal connective tissue, "mattomainen kasvu" might be benign hyperplasia. Also, the nuclei are faded, which could mean they can't assess properly. So maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no clear malignancy mentioned, or "NA" due to technical issues. The user instructions say to answer "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is inadequate or uncertain, maybe "NA". But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report can't confirm due to technical issues, perhaps "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if it's uncertain, maybe "NA". Hmm. The text says "hankaloittaa solujen erilaistumisasteiden arviointia" (difficult to assess differentiation). So they can't determine if it's malignant. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is uncertain, so "NA" might be appropriate. Wait, but the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't explicitly say it's benign, maybe "NA" is better here. Because the technical issues prevent proper assessment. So for question 2, answer "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since we determined that malignancy isn't confirmed (question 2 is "NA"), then the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a mention, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So "NA" here.

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: NA
3. Gleason: NA
