Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" which translates to extracted prostate material. The mention of "useampi fragmentti" (multiple fragments) and "3/5g" might indicate a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, TURP usually yields chips or fragments, and biopsy can also be fragmented. The text doesn't mention surgery like RP, so maybe TURP? But the term "ekstraktoitu" could mean extracted via biopsy. Hmm. The user might need to default to NA if it's unclear.

Next, presence of malignancy. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" (stroma and mat-like growth), but the nuclei are faded ("tumat ovat häiventyneet") and technical noise complicates assessing differentiation. There's no clear mention of cancer, just some growth that's hard to evaluate. The report also says that part of the material is too mixed and suggests more QC. Since there's no definitive malignant features described, maybe the answer is "ei" (no), but the uncertainty is there. However, the absence of clear malignancy might lead to "ei" or NA. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps "ei" is appropriate here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". But since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there was some suspicion, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So here, it's definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is unclear between biopsy and TURP, but since the text doesn't specify the procedure, maybe NA. Malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei". Gleason is NA. Wait, but the user said "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). However, in this case, the report doesn't clearly identify any malignant lesions. The growth mentioned is in stroma and mat-like, but with technical issues. So the answer for malignancy is "ei" or maybe NA? The options are kyllä, ei, NA. If the report is inconclusive due to technical issues, maybe NA is better. But the user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state malignancy, then "ei". But the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be benign or uncertain. Since the differentiation is hard to assess, maybe the pathologist couldn't confirm malignancy, hence "ei" or NA. The user's allowed values for malignancy are kyllä, ei, NA. If the sample is inadequate or uncertain, maybe NA. But the text says "tumors are faded" and technical noise, so maybe they can't confirm. So perhaps malignancy is NA. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the answer is that they couldn't determine due to technical issues, then maybe NA. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. So if the report doesn't state malignancy, but the assessment is hindered, should it be NA? The user's instruction says "palauta pahimman leesion tulokset" (return the worst lesion's results). If no lesion is confirmed as malignant, then "ei". But if the presence is uncertain, maybe NA. This is a bit tricky. The text doesn't explicitly say malignant, so perhaps "ei".

So final answers:
1. Original sample type: The text mentions multiple fragments, which is common in TURP, but "ekstraktoitu" might mean biopsy. Since it's unclear, maybe NA.
Wait, TURP is a procedure that removes prostate chips, so "useampi fragmentti" could align with TURP. But the term "ekstraktoitu" is a bit vague. However, in medical terms, TURP specimens are often fragmented. So maybe TURP is the correct answer here. Let me check: TURP specimens are usually multiple fragments, while biopsies are smaller. The sample here is 3/5g, which is a few grams. TURP can yield more tissue than a biopsy. So likely TURP. So sample type is TURP.

2. Malignancy: No clear malignant features, technical issues hinder assessment. So answer "ei".

3. Gleason: Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

So the JSON would be:

{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
