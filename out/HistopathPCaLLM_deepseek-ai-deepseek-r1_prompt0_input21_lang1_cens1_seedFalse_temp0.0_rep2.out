Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale..." The mention of "fragmentti" (fragments) suggests it's a biopsy, as biopsies are typically fragmented. RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) usually refer to larger specimens. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The text says "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään", which translates to stromal tissue and mat-like growth. However, "tumat ovat häiventyneed" (nuclei are faded) and technical issues complicate assessing cell differentiation. There's no clear mention of cancer, just some ambiguous findings. Since malignancy isn't explicitly confirmed, the answer should be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't state malignancy, but mentions growth. However, without clear signs of cancer, maybe "ei" is safer. But I need to check if "mattomainen kasvu" is malignant. Mattomainen kasvu (mat-like growth) could be benign or malignant. Since the nuclei are faded and differentiation is hard to assess, maybe they can't confirm malignancy. So "ei" or "NA"? The question is whether there were malignant findings. If uncertain, maybe "NA" is better. But the user said "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei". Hmm, tricky. Let me go with "ei" because there's no explicit mention of cancer, just some ambiguous growth with technical issues.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was some growth, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type biopsy, malignancy no, Gleason NA.
