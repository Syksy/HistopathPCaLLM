Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale..." The term "fragmentti" (fragment) suggests that it's not a whole prostate removal (RP) or TURP. Biopsy samples are often fragmented. So I'll go with "biopsy" here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" (stromal tissue and mat-like growth), but "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical noise makes it hard to assess differentiation. There's no clear mention of cancer, just some ambiguous findings. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions some growth, but the nuclei are faded and technical issues complicate assessment. It's unclear. However, the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" might be suspicious, but without clear signs of malignancy, perhaps "ei" or "NA". The user instructions say to answer based on whether malignant findings were present. If the report doesn't confirm it, maybe "ei" or "NA". Hmm. The text doesn't explicitly state cancer, so maybe "ei" (no). But I need to be careful. The user might consider "mattomaista kasvua" as possible malignancy, but since the nuclei are faded and there's technical noise, it's uncertain. The presence of malignant findings is not confirmed, so maybe "ei" or "NA". The options for this field are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive due to technical issues, perhaps "NA" is appropriate. Wait, the third question says Gleason is "NA" for benign. So if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is reported. In this case, since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. But the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be a tumor. However, without clear malignant features, perhaps it's considered benign. The user might expect "ei" here. Let me check again. The text says "tumat ovat häiventyneet" which might mean the nuclei are not well-defined, making it hard to assess. Technical issues complicate differentiation. So the conclusion is that they can't confirm malignancy due to technical reasons. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, so maybe "ei" or "NA". The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't state malignancy clearly, but mentions possible growth, but due to technical issues, it's unclear. The safest bet might be "NA" if it's uncertain. But the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei". However, if the findings are ambiguous but not confirmed, maybe "ei". Alternatively, if the sample is inadequate (QC issues), maybe "NA". The text mentions that more QC is needed. So perhaps the sample is insufficient, leading to "NA" for malignancy. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample is inadequate, maybe they can't determine, so "NA". But the options for the second field are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if the sample is inadequate, and they can't assess, then "NA". The text says "liian sekoittunutta materiaalia" (too mixed material) and "lisää QC:ta tulisi tehdä" (more QC needed). So the sample quality is poor, leading to inability to assess properly. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain due to technical issues. Wait, but the user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they can't assess due to technical reasons, then the answer is "NA". So for question 2, the answer would be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. If there are no malignant findings (if question 2 is "ei" or "NA"), then Gleason is "NA". Since in this case, if question 2 is "NA", then Gleason is "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason score, which supports "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: "biopsy" (based on fragments).
2. Malignant findings: "NA" (due to technical issues preventing assessment).
3. Gleason: "NA" (since malignancy isn't confirmed).
