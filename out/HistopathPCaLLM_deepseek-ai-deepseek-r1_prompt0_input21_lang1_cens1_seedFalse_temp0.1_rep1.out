Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" which translates to "Extracted prostate material". The terms "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly mentioned. Since there's no clear indication of the procedure type, I'll have to mark this as "NA".

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" (stroma and mat-like growth), but the nuclei ("tumat") are faded, and technical background noise complicates assessing cell differentiation. There's no explicit mention of malignancy like "carcinoma" or "malignant cells". The uncertainty due to technical issues might mean they can't confirm malignancy. So, the presence of malignancy here is likely "ei" (no), but I need to be careful. However, since the report doesn't clearly state malignancy and mentions technical difficulties, maybe it's safer to put "ei" because there's no definitive evidence provided.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. This is only required if malignancy is present. Since we determined malignancy as "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there were some growth mentioned, without confirmation of malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable here.

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no)
3. Gleason: NA
