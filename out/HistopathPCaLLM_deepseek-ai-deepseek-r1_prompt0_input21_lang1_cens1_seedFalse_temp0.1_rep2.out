Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale..." The term "fragmentti" (fragment) suggests it's a biopsy, as biopsies are typically fragmented. RP and TURP usually refer to surgical specimens, but the description here doesn't mention surgery, just extracted fragments. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" (stroma and mat-like growth are seen), but "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical noise complicates assessing differentiation. There's no clear mention of cancer, just some ambiguous growth. Since it's uncertain and the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the presence of malignant findings should be "ei" (no). However, the mention of "mattomaista kasvua" might be suspicious, but without confirmation, it's safer to say "ei" or maybe "NA". Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive due to technical issues, maybe "NA" is better. But the user said to consider only the worst lesion. Since the text doesn't clearly state malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct. Hmm, but the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be a sign. However, without clear malignant features, and considering the technical difficulties, maybe the answer is "ei". Or maybe the report is inconclusive, leading to "NA". The user instructions say to return the worst lesion's results. If the sample is too degraded to assess, maybe the presence is "NA". But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report can't confirm due to technical issues, then the answer might be "NA". However, the user might expect "ei" if no malignancy is found. But the text says "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" which could be benign or malignant. Since the differentiation is hard to assess, maybe it's uncertain, hence "NA". But I need to check the exact phrasing. The user's instructions say to answer based on whether malignant findings are present. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei" or "NA"? The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is inadequate, maybe "NA". But the presence is about whether malignant findings were found, not the adequacy. If the report doesn't state malignancy, then "ei". But the text doesn't explicitly say "ei pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". It's ambiguous. Maybe the correct answer here is "NA" because the technical issues prevent proper assessment. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If they couldn't assess due to quality, maybe it's "NA". Alternatively, if no malignancy is detected despite the issues, then "ei". This is a bit tricky. Let me re-read the text. The key part is "Vaikka stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään, tumat ovat häiventyneet ja tekninen taustahäly hankaloittaa solujen erilaistumisasteiden arviointia." So they see some growth, but the nuclei are faded and technical noise makes assessing differentiation difficult. So they can't confirm if it's malignant because they can't assess the differentiation properly. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is uncertain, so "NA" might be appropriate here. But the user's allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state malignancy, but the sample is inadequate, should it be "ei" or "NA"? The user might expect "NA" when the assessment can't be made. So I'll go with "NA" for the second field.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since we determined the presence is "NA" (or maybe "ei"), the Gleason would be "NA". But if the presence was "ei", then Gleason is "NA". Either way, in this case, since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is "NA".
