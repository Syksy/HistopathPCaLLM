Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. "Needle biopsies" clearly points to "biopsy," so that's the first field done.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The left side has carcinoma (which is malignant), and the right side doesn't. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion, which is the left side. So the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the left side has Gleason 3 and 4. The preferred format is major + minor = sum. The primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. The right side is benign, but since we're taking the most severe (left), it's 3+4=7. Need to present it as "3+4=7" in the JSON.

Check if all fields are correctly addressed. No nested structures, values are correct. Should be good to go.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
