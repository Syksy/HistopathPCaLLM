Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so that clearly points to "biopsy." Got that down.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The left side has carcinoma (which is malignant), and the right side doesn't. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Since the left side is malignant, the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The left side has Gleason 3 and 4. The major is the higher grade, so 4, and minor is 3. Sum is 4+3=7. So it should be "4+3=7."

Wait, but the user said "preferably 'major+minor=sum'" as whole numbers. So I need to make sure the order is correct. The first mentioned is 3, then 4. But in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the higher grade. So even if it's listed first as 3 and then 4, the major is 4 and minor is 3. So the correct notation is 4+3=7. That's right.

No nested structures, just flat JSON. Check if all fields are covered. Sample type: biopsy. Malignant: yes. Gleason: 4+3=7. All set. No NA needed here since all info is present. The right side is benign, but the left is worse, so we take the left. Alright, that should be it.
