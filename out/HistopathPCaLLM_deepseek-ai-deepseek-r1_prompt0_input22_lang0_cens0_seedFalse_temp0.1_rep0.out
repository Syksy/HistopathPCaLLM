Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. First, I need to identify the three fields required: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

Starting with the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so that clearly points to "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The left side has carcinoma (malignant), and the right side doesn't. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion, so since there's malignancy on the left, the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The left side has Gleason 3 and 4. The major is the higher grade, so 4, and minor is 3. Sum is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade would be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, check if any part is missing. The text doesn't mention RP or TURP, so sample type is biopsy. Malignant is yes. Gleason is correctly calculated. All seems good. Let's structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```
