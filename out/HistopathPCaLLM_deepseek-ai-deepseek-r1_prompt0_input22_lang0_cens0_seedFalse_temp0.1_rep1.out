Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. "Needle biopsies" clearly points to "biopsy," so that's the first field done.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The left side has carcinoma (which is malignant), and the right side doesn't. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. Since carcinoma is present, the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The preferred format is major + minor = sum. The major is the higher grade, so 4, and minor is 3. Sum is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON. Also, check if all values are correct. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason 4+3=7. That's all. No NA needed here except maybe if some info was missing, but in this case, all data is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
