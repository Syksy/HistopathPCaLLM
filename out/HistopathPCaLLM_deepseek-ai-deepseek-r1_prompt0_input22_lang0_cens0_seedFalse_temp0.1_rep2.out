Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies from both side." So the sample type is definitely a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that the left side fragments have carcinoma tissue structures, which are malignant. The right side doesn't show malignancies. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Since left side has carcinoma (malignant), the answer here should be yes.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum. The left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The primary (major) is 4 and minor is 3? Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is typically reported as the most prevalent pattern (major) followed by the next most prevalent (minor). The text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So major is 3, minor is 4. Sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes there's confusion. Let me double-check. The primary pattern is the most extensive, and secondary is the next. If the report says "firstly" and "secondly," that would mean primary 3, secondary 4. So 3+4=7. That's correct.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since left side is malignant and right is not, left is more severe. The Gleason score from the left is used.
