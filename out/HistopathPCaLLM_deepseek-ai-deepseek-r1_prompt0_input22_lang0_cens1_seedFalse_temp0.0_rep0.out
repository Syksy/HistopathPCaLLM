Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The term "sampling material" and the mention of fragments might suggest a biopsy, but the report also talks about fragmentation and the need for reprocessing. However, the exact procedure isn't clearly stated. The user might not have specified, so maybe NA is safer here. But wait, biopsies often involve fragmented samples, so maybe it's a biopsy. Hmm, but the report says the samples are highly fragmented and can't be assessed, which sometimes happens in biopsies. I'm leaning towards biopsy for the sample type.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't assess it, does that mean NA? The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the assessment wasn't possible, the answer here should be NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The report states that assigning a Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and possible contamination. They couldn't determine it, so the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were mentions of cell differentiation, the inability to assign a grade means it's not reported.

So putting it all together: sample type might be biopsy, but the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure. The mention of "prostate tissue sampling" could imply biopsy, but if it's not clear, maybe NA. However, given the context of sampling from both sides and fragmentation, biopsy is a common procedure for that. Malignant findings are NA because assessment wasn't possible. Gleason is NA as well.
