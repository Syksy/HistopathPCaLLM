Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms like "sampling material" and the mention of fragmentation might suggest a biopsy, but the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, terms like "fragmentation" and "samples originating from the left and right sides" are common in biopsy contexts. But I need to be careful. The report also says the samples are highly fragmented and need reprocessing, which might be a clue. However, without explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe it's safer to put NA here. Wait, but "tissue sampling material" could imply biopsy. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe TURP? TURP usually involves removing tissue from the prostate via the urethra, often for relieving symptoms, but the text doesn't mention that. The user might expect "biopsy" here, but since the sample is fragmented and the origin is in question, maybe the original sample type isn't clear. The report says "need to be reprocessed," which might mean the sample type isn't confirmed. So maybe NA is the right choice here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." So the pathologist couldn't determine malignancy due to fragmentation and possible contamination. Therefore, the answer here should be NA, since the assessment wasn't possible.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy couldn't be assessed, and the Gleason grade couldn't be assigned due to difficulty in cell architecture, the answer here is NA. The report mentions assigning a Gleason is exceptionally difficult and that proof-checking is needed, so there's no Gleason provided.

Putting it all together: original sample type NA (since it's not explicitly stated and there's uncertainty), malignant findings NA (couldn't assess), Gleason NA (not determined).
