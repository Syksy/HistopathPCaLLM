Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The term "sampling material" suggests it's a biopsy, as biopsies are samples taken for testing. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't determine malignancy, the answer here should be "NA" because the assessment wasn't conclusive.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. The text states that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to fragmented samples and possible contamination. Since they couldn't assess malignancies, there's no Gleason grade reported. So this should be "NA".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered, but the text doesn't mention any specific lesions, just that assessment wasn't possible. So all fields should be NA except sample type, which is biopsy. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm. Yes, the sample type is from tissue sampling, which aligns with biopsy. Malignancy couldn't be assessed, so NA. Gleason grade also NA. That seems right.
