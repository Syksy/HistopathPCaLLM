Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided text about a prostate cancer histopathological report. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The term "sampling material" and the mention of fragmentation might suggest a biopsy, but the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, since the samples are fragmented and from both sides, maybe it's a biopsy. But wait, TURP can also yield fragmented tissue. However, the report mentions that the samples need to be reprocessed because they're highly fragmented and can't be assessed. The original sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the answer here is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't assess it, the presence of malignancy isn't determined. So the answer here should be NA, not yes or no, because the assessment wasn't possible.

Third, the Gleason grade. The text mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and possible contamination. Since they couldn't assign a Gleason grade, the answer here is NA. Even if there were attempts, the report states it's too difficult, so no major+minor=sum is provided.

So putting it all together: original sample type is NA (since the procedure isn't specified), malignant findings are NA (couldn't assess), and Gleason grade is NA. Need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since no malignancy is confirmed, all fields default to NA where applicable.
