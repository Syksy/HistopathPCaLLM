Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" with fragmentation from left and right sides. The terms like "sampling material" and "fragmented" suggest it's a biopsy, as biopsies often come in fragments. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't determine malignancy due to sample issues, the answer here should be "NA" because it's not confirmed as yes or no.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. However, the report states assigning a Gleason is "exceptionally difficult" due to the fragmented samples and varying cell architectures. They also mention checking if the samples are contaminated. Since they couldn't determine the Gleason grade, the value should be "NA".

So putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the sample couldn't be assessed, there's no higher severity to report.
