Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms like "sampling material" and "fragmented" make me think this is a biopsy, as biopsies often involve fragmented samples. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't determine malignancy due to sample issues, the answer here should be "NA" because the assessment wasn't possible.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. The statement mentions difficulty assigning a Gleason grade due to fragmented and varying samples. Since they couldn't assess malignancies, the Gleason grade isn't provided. So this should be "NA".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered, but the text doesn't mention multiple lesions, just fragmented samples. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. So the final JSON should have the three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
