Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä molemmilta puolilta" which translates to "thick needle samples from both sides of the prostate." Thick needle biopsy is likely a biopsy, so the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The left side fragments show "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which is low-differentiated carcinoma, so malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy. Since the question is about the presence of any malignancy, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." That translates to primary pattern 3 and secondary pattern 4, so the sum is 3+4=7. The right side is benign, so we only consider the worst lesion, which is the left side. The format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and using the allowed values. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 3+4=7. All seems correct. No other data points to consider. The answer should be straightforward.
