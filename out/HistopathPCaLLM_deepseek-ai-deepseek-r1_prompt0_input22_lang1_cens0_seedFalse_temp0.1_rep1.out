Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "purkillinen prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä molemmilta puolilta," which translates to "a jar of prostate thick-needle samples from both sides." Thick-needle samples typically refer to biopsy samples. So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check for malignancy. The report states that the left side fragments show "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (low-differentiated carcinoma tissue), which is malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy ("eivät näytä malignilta"). Since there's at least one malignant finding, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the left side has mainly pattern 3 and secondarily pattern 4. The correct format is major + minor = sum. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Wait, but the text says "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." That translates to pattern 3 as primary and pattern 4 as secondary. So major is 3, minor is 4? Wait, no. Wait, Gleason scoring is based on the most prevalent (major) and the next most prevalent (minor). However, in current practice, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next. However, the sum is primary + secondary. But in the report, it's stated as "pääsääntöisesti" (mainly) 3 and "toiseksi eniten" (second most) 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 3+4=7. But the user instructions say to format as "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher grade? Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary (most extensive) pattern is listed first, then the secondary. So even if the secondary is higher, like in this case, it's 3 + 4 = 7. But sometimes, if the higher grade is the secondary, the sum is still primary + secondary. So in this case, it's 3 + 4 = 7. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum". So major is the primary (most extensive), minor is the secondary. So the correct format here is "3+4=7".

But I need to confirm. The text says "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

The right side doesn't show malignancy, but since we're only considering the worst lesion, which is on the left side, that's the one to report. The right side's benign findings don't affect the Gleason score here.

So putting it all together:

1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: yes
3. Gleason: 3+4=7
