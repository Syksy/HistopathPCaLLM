Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Thick needle biopsy is a type of biopsy, so the sample type here is "biopsy."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report says "vasemman puolen fragmenteissa näkyy lähinnä matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa," which means "in the left side fragments, there is mainly low-differentiated carcinoma tissue." Carcinoma is malignant. Also, the right side fragments don't show malignancy ("eivät näytä malignilta"), but since the left side does, the answer should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." This translates to "Gleason growth pattern 3 predominantly and second most pattern 4." The major pattern is 3, minor is 4, so the sum is 3+4=7. The format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, only the worst lesion (left side in this case) is considered, so the right side's negative result doesn't affect the malignancy or Gleason fields. The Gleason is only reported if malignancy is present, which it is here. 

Double-checking the sample type: "paksuneulanäytteitä" is biopsy. Malignancy is confirmed on the left. Gleason 3+4=7. All fields correctly filled without nesting. Looks good.
