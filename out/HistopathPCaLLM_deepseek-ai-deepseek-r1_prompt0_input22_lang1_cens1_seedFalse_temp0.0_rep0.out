Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin" which translates to "Jar of prostate tissue samples were examined." The term "purkillinen" suggests it's a container, which is common in biopsies or TURP specimens. However, the report mentions that the samples are fragmented and from both left and right sides, which is more typical of a biopsy. RP usually refers to the entire prostate being removed, which isn't mentioned here. TURP is a procedure to remove part of the prostate, often for benign enlargement, but the text doesn't specify that. So I'm leaning towards biopsy.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types), which could indicate abnormal cells. However, it also states that the samples are too fragmented and varied for classification and need reprocessing. The key point here is whether there's a confirmed malignancy. The text doesn't explicitly state cancer; instead, it says determining Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to sample issues, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, or maybe "NA". Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions some atypical cells. However, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the samples are unsuitable for classification and need reprocessing, there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. So "ei" might be correct, but maybe "NA" if the presence can't be determined. The question is, does "ei" mean no malignancy found, or is it used when the sample is inadequate? The text says they can't classify, so maybe "NA" is better here. Hmm, but the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If they can't assess due to sample issues, maybe the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if they didn't find any definite malignancy, it's "ei". The report mentions chronic inflammation and atypical cells but no clear cancer. So perhaps "ei" is correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The text explicitly states that determining the Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the sample's fragmentation and variability. They can't classify it, so the Gleason score should be "NA". The options are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases or "NA" for benign. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Wait, but the sample type: the term "purkillinen" might refer to a container, which could be a biopsy jar. The report doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP, so biopsy is the most likely. So the final JSON should be:

1. "biopsy"
2. "ei"
3. "NA"

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
```
