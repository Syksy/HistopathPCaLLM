Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin." "Purkillinen" translates to "jar" or "container," and "kudosnäytteitä" means tissue samples. This sounds like a biopsy, as it's referring to samples taken from the prostate, possibly via a needle biopsy. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy."

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä," which suggests abnormal cell differentiation. However, the text also states that the samples are too fragmented and varied for classification, and they need reprocessing. Importantly, there's no explicit mention of cancer cells or malignancy. The Gleason grade can't be determined due to the sample quality. Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report is inconclusive, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because they didn't find definitive malignant findings, just suspicious but unclassifiable features. Wait, but the presence of abnormal cells might be considered. However, the key is whether malignant findings were present. Since the report says they can't classify it and need reprocessing, maybe it's not confirmed. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The answer might be "ei" because they couldn't confirm malignancy due to sample issues. Alternatively, if there's any mention of malignancy, but here it's unclear. The report mentions chronic inflammation and abnormal cells but doesn't state cancer. So "ei" is safer.

Third, Gleason grade. Since the samples are too fragmented and varied, they couldn't determine the Gleason score. The text says "Gleason-luokan määrittäminen... olisi poikkeuksellisen vaikeaa" and "eivät sovellu luokitteluun." Therefore, the Gleason grade is not reported, so "NA."

So the structured data would be:
1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA
