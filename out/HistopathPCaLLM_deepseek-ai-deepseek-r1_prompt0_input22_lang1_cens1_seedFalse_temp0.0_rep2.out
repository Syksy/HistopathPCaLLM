Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin" which translates to "Jar of prostate tissue samples were examined." The term "purkillinen" suggests it's a container, possibly from a biopsy. But I need to be careful. Biopsy samples are usually small, and TURP is a procedure that removes tissue, often for benign conditions. However, the text mentions fragmentation, which is common in TURP specimens. Wait, but the user might consider "purkillinen" as a biopsy. Hmm. Alternatively, if the sample is from TURP, then the type would be TURP. The text also mentions the samples are fragmented, which is typical for TURP. So maybe TURP is the correct type here. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The sample is from the prostate, and the term "purkillinen" might just mean jarred, not specifying the procedure. However, the mention of fragments from left and right sides could indicate TURP. Alternatively, it could be a biopsy, but biopsies are usually more targeted. Given the fragmentation and multiple samples from both sides, TURP seems more likely. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" which translates to "unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types." This might suggest some abnormality, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. The report also says that determining the Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide scale of differentiation levels. However, there's no clear mention of cancer. The chronic inflammation is noted, but that's benign. The conclusion is that the samples are too fragmented and variable for classification and need reprocessing. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer (like carcinoma, malignancy, etc.), and the inability to classify, the presence of malignancy would be "ei" (no). But wait, the user said to consider only the worst lesion. If there's no mention of cancer, then it's "ei". So the second field is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be NA. The text also states that determining Gleason is too difficult due to the sample's condition, so even if there was suspicion, it's not reported. So definitely NA here.

Double-checking all three fields. Sample type: TURP because of the fragmented samples from both sides, typical for TURP. Malignancy: no explicit mention, so "ei". Gleason: NA. That seems right.
