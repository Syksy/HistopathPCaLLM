Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "purkillinen" refers to a jar, which is typically used for biopsy samples. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the sample type is likely biopsy.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report talks about chronic inflammation ("Kroonista tulehdusta") and unusual cell differentiation scales. However, there's no explicit mention of cancer or malignant findings. The Gleason grade couldn't be determined because the samples were too fragmented and varied. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here should be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." The report doesn't state any malignant findings, just that the samples are unsuitable for classification. So, since there's no mention of cancer, the presence of malignancy is "ei."

For the Gleason grade, the text says determining it is exceptionally difficult due to the fragmented and varied samples. They recommend reprocessing. Since no Gleason score is provided and the samples aren't suitable, the value should be "NA."

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignancy isn't present, so "ei." Gleason isn't reported, so NA. Looks good.
