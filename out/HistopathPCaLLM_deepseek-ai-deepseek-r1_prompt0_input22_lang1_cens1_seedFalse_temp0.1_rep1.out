Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the original sample is described as "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin". The word "purkillinen" translates to "jar" or "container", which might refer to a biopsy sample collected in a container. However, I need to be careful. "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, and "TURP" is transurethral resection of the prostate. Since the text mentions "näytemateriaalissa" (sample material) from left and right sides, but doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP, it's more likely a biopsy. But wait, sometimes "purkillinen" could also refer to TURP specimens which are collected in containers. Hmm. The text also mentions the samples are fragmented, which is common in TURP specimens. However, the report states that the samples are not suitable for classification and need reprocessing. TURP specimens are usually multiple chips, but biopsies are core samples. The fragmentation here is described as "pirstaloituneet", which might be more like biopsy cores that are fragmented. Alternatively, maybe the sample type isn't clearly specified. The user might default to "NA" if unsure. But given the mention of "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" (prostate tissue samples) without specifying the procedure, maybe "biopsy" is safer. Wait, but in some contexts, TURP is also a way to collect samples. However, without explicit mention of TURP or RP, perhaps "biopsy" is the best guess here. Alternatively, maybe "NA" is better if it's unclear. The user might need to check if "purkillinen" implies a specific type. In Finnish medical terms, "purkillinen" in this context usually refers to biopsy samples collected in a container. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types), which might suggest some abnormality. However, the key is whether there's a mention of malignancy. The text also says "Kroonista tulehdusta havaitaan systemaattisesti" (chronic inflammation is observed systematically). Chronic inflammation is benign. The main point is whether there's cancer. The report states that determining Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide differentiation scale, but it doesn't explicitly state that cancer is present. The samples are too fragmented and varied, so they can't be classified. Since there's no clear mention of carcinoma or malignancy, and the inability to classify might be due to technical issues rather than confirmed cancer, the presence of malignancy would be "ei" (no). However, another angle: the presence of "solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (cell differentiation types) could indicate cancer, but without confirmation, maybe it's uncertain. But the user's instruction is to answer based on whether malignant findings were present. Since the report doesn't confirm cancer, just mentions difficulty in classification, perhaps the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if the suspicion is there but not confirmed, maybe "NA". But the options are strict. The third option is "NA" only for benign cases. Wait, the third field's Gleason is "NA" if benign. So if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". The report says they can't determine Gleason because the samples are too fragmented. So if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But does the text indicate any malignancy? The key is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" which could be atypical cells, but not necessarily malignant. Since the report doesn't state carcinoma or malignancy explicitly, and the samples are inconclusive, the presence of malignancy should be "ei". Therefore, answer "ei" for the second field.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". Additionally, the text explicitly states that determining Gleason is exceptionally difficult and the samples are not suitable for classification. So even if there were some suspicion, the Gleason can't be determined. Hence, "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: "biopsy" (since it's tissue samples in a container, likely biopsy)
2. Malignancy: "ei" (no explicit mention of cancer, inconclusive due to sample issues)
3. Gleason: "NA" (no malignancy, and couldn't be determined)
