Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin". The word "purkillinen" translates to "jar" or "container", but in medical terms, this might refer to a biopsy sample collected in a container. "Prostatan kudosnäytteitä" means prostate tissue samples. So, the original sample type here is likely a biopsy. I don't see any mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so "biopsy" seems correct.

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report talks about chronic inflammation ("Kroonista tulehdusta") and unusual cell differentiation scales. However, there's no explicit mention of cancer or malignant cells. The Gleason grade couldn't be determined because the samples are too fragmented and varied. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here should be "ei" (no), but wait. Wait, the presence of "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types) might suggest some abnormality. But the key is whether malignant findings are present. The text says the samples are unsuitable for classification and need reprocessing. Since Gleason couldn't be determined and there's no explicit mention of cancer, maybe the answer is "ei". But I need to be careful. The absence of confirmed malignancy would mean "ei". So, "ei" is correct here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the report states that determining the Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the fragmented and varied samples, and they need to reprocess, there's no Gleason provided. Also, since malignancy wasn't confirmed (answer was "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms. "Purkillinen" does refer to a container, which in a medical context is typically a biopsy jar. The report doesn't mention surgery (RP or TURP), so biopsy is correct. The malignancy part is tricky because there's mention of abnormal cells, but without confirmation of cancer. Since they can't classify it, it's safer to say "ei". Gleason is definitely NA here.
