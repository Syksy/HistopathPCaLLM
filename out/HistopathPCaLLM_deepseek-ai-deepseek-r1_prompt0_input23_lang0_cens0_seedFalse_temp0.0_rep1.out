Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy typically refers to RP, so the sample type should be RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is definitely yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The primary and secondary grades are needed. The text mentions differentiation stage 4 (60%) as the main, then stage 5 (30%). So major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, the user specified to take the most severe lesion, which would be the primary and secondary. So the Gleason should be 4+5=9.

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, check for allowed values again. Sample type RP is allowed. Malignant is yes. Gleason format is correct. No typos. JSON should be valid with quotes and commas properly placed.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
