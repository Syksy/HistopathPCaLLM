Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so RP is the correct answer here. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the conclusion says "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. The main components are 4 and 5, but the sum is 9. However, the standard Gleason scoring adds the two most prevalent grades. The text mentions the main is 4 (60%), second is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. So the primary is 4, secondary 5, sum 4+5=9. So the answer should be "4+5=9."

Wait, but the user said "preferably 'major+minor=sum'." So even though the sum is given as 9, the correct format is combining the two highest grades. The conclusion states sum 9, which aligns with 4+5. So the structured answer should be "4+5=9."

Check if there's any conflicting info. The tertiary is 3, but that's the least area, so it's not included in the main Gleason score. So the answer is correct.

No nested structures, just flat JSON. All values are present and valid. No NA needed here. So the final JSON should have RP, yes, and 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
