Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatectomy preparate". Prostatectomy typically refers to surgical removal of the prostate, which is usually Radical Prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here is likely "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5". The primary and secondary grades are mentioned earlier: mainly grade 4 (60%) and the second most common grade 5 (30%). Tertiary grade 3 is noted but since we only consider the two highest grades contributing to the sum, it's 4 + 5 = 9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion's results are considered, which in this case is the 4+5=9. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me verify each part again to make sure there are no mistakes. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
