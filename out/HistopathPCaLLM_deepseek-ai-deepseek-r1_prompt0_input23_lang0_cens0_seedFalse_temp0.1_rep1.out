Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatectomy preparate". A prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, which is usually a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, check for malignant tumor findings. The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5". The user prefers the format "major+minor=sum". The primary grade (major) is 4, as it's the most common (60%), and the secondary (minor) is 5 (30%). However, in the Gleason scoring system, the sum is the primary plus the secondary. But wait, the sum here is given as 9, which would be 4 + 5. But sometimes when there's a tertiary grade, the highest grades are considered. However, the user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The conclusion directly states the sum is 9, so even though the tertiary is 3, the main sum is 4+5=9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. Let me verify each part again. Sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. That fits the allowed values. The tertiary grade is mentioned but since we take the most severe, which is the primary and secondary, the sum is correctly 9. The conclusion also confirms this. So the JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
