Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so RP is the correct answer here. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example format is major+minor=sum. The conclusion says Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5. The main components are grade 4 and 5. The major is the most prevalent, which is 4 (60%), minor is 5 (30%). So it should be 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but since we only take the most severe lesion, we focus on the primary and secondary. 

Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Also, check if any values might be NA. In this case, all fields have clear answers. So the final JSON should have RP, yes, and 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
