Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prepared sample set" and "reprocessed with a focus on the apex." There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The prior report mentions an "incomplete report of sampled apex," which might suggest a biopsy, but it's not certain. Since the sample is being reprocessed, maybe the original type isn't specified here. So I'll go with NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text refers to "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior report. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which indicates malignancy. However, the current conclusion is about reprocessing to validate initial suspicions. Since the prior report mentioned potential findings but it's not confirmed in the current sample, maybe the answer here is NA. But wait, the presence of Gleason 3 would typically indicate malignancy. However, the current statement says the sample is to be reprocessed to validate, so maybe the current report doesn't confirm it yet. So the answer might be NA, but I need to check if the mention of Gleason 3 in the prior report affects this. The instructions say to consider the most severe lesion from the current statement. Since the current conclusion is about reprocessing and the prior report's findings are not confirmed here, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, if the potential Gleason 3 is considered, then yes. Hmm, tricky. The user says to take the most severe lesion from the provided statement. The prior incomplete report is mentioned, but the current conclusion is to reprocess. So maybe the current sample hasn't confirmed malignancy yet. So malignant findings would be NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum. The prior report mentions Gleason 3, but it's incomplete. The current sample's conclusion is to reprocess to validate. Since the current statement doesn't confirm the Gleason grade, and the prior report is incomplete, the answer here should be NA. Even though there's a mention of Gleason 3, it's from a prior incomplete report, and the current sample hasn't validated it yet. So Gleason grade is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA
3. Gleason grade: NA
