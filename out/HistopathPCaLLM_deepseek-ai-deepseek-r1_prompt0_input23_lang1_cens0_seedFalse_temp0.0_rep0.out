Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So RP is the correct type here. That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report clearly states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions specify the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. The summary at the end says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." Looking back at the details: the primary pattern is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. However, Gleason scoring typically uses the primary and secondary grades, adding them for the sum. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, the main components are 4 and 5, summing to 9. So the correct format here is "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but it's the least, so it's ignored in the Gleason sum. Also, checking for any other possible issues like margins or capsule invasion, but the text says those are negative, which doesn't affect the fields we're focusing on.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the three fields with the determined values. No missing information here, so no NAs needed except where applicable. All the required data points are present in the text.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
