Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy is RP, the first field should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text describes "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the summary states "Gleason-pistesumma on 9". The required format is "major+minor=sum". The report mentions the primary grade is 4 (60%), the secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. However, Gleason scoring typically takes the two most prevalent grades. Here, primary is 4 and secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. Even though there's a tertiary 3, it's not included in the sum. So the answer should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results. All values are properly formatted as per the allowed options. No mistakes here.

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
