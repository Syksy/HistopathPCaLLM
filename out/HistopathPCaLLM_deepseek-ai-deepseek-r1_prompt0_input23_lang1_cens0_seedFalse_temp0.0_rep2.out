Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "prostatektomiapreparaastista," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So RP would be the correct type here. That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). No doubts there.

Now the Gleason grade. The instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" with integers, and "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is present, we need to extract the major and minor components. The report states "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." But the Gleason score is typically the sum of the two most common grades. The text also mentions the primary grade is 4 (60%), the secondary is 5 (30%), and a tertiary 3. However, the tertiary is usually not included in the sum. So major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. The JSON should have "4+5=9".

Wait, but sometimes when the highest grade is present, even if it's secondary, they might take the highest grades. But according to standard Gleason scoring, the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) are added. Here, primary is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), so 4+5=9. The summary also confirms the sum is 9, so that's correct. The tertiary 3 is ignored for the score.

So putting it all together: sample type RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+5=9. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results. The example in the problem didn't include tertiary, so we stick with the primary and secondary.
