Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "prostatektomiapreparaastista käynnistetyistä leikkeistä." "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen, so RP is the correct type here. Biopsy and TURP don't fit, so the first field is "RP".

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). The third part is the Gleason score. The summary states "Gleason-pistesumma on 9," which is 4 + 5 = 9. The major pattern is 4 (60%) and minor is 5 (30%), so the format should be "4+5=9". Tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but since we only take the primary and secondary, it's excluded. 

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion. All required fields are addressed correctly. Let me double-check the terms to avoid mistakes. Yes, everything seems to align with the given options. No issues spotted.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
