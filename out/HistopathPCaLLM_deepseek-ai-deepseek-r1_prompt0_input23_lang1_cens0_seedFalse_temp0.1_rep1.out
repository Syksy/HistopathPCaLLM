Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, identifying the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions specify the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. The summary section says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9". Looking at the details, the primary grade is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. However, Gleason scoring typically uses the two highest grades. Since the primary is 4 and secondary is 5, the sum is 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is usually not included in the sum. So the correct format is "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled appropriately.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
