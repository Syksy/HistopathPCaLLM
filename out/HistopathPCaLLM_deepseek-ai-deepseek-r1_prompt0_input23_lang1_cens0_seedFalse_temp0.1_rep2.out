Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, so the sample type here is RP. So the first answer is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which means adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the presence is "kyllä" (yes).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The summary says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9". The structure required is "major+minor=sum". The report mentions the main grade is 4 (60%), then the next is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. But Gleason score is the sum of the two most predominant grades. Here, the primary is 4 and secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is ignored. So the answer is "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The sample type is RP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 4+5=9. All other details like tertiary grade 3 or margins are irrelevant here.
