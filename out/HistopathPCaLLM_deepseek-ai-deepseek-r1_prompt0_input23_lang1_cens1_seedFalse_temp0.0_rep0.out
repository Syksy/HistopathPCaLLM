Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen" which means the sample needs reprocessing. The original sample type isn't explicitly stated. There's a mention of "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä" (previous report on apex samples), but that's about prior samples. The current sample's type isn't specified, so I think the answer here is NA.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text refers to "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" in the previous report. However, the current sample's analysis isn't concluded yet. The summary says they need to reprocess the sample to validate the original suspicion. Since the current report doesn't confirm malignancy yet, the answer should be "ei" or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample is being reprocessed. Since the current sample's findings aren't confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because the presence isn't confirmed here. Or is the previous report's mention enough? The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. But the current sample's analysis is incomplete. So maybe the answer is "ei" because the current sample hasn't found malignancy yet. Alternatively, if the previous Gleason 3 is considered, but that's from a prior report. The current sample's YHTEENVETO says they need to validate the original suspicion, which might be malignant. But the current sample's result isn't confirmed. So perhaps the answer is "ei" since the current sample's processing isn't done, and the malignancy isn't confirmed here. Or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, NA. If the sample hasn't been processed properly yet, maybe the presence is NA. But the user says to take the worst lesion's results. However, the current sample's analysis is incomplete, so maybe the answer is NA. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample is from the central area and base, but they need to reprocess focusing on apex. So the current sample's analysis doesn't show malignancy, hence "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample's analysis isn't confirming it yet. Since the current sample's processing is incomplete and they need to redo it, the Gleason here would be NA. Because the current sample's result isn't available yet. The instructions say to report the Gleason for malignant findings. Since the current sample's malignancy is not confirmed (answer is "ei"), then Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no, since current sample's analysis is incomplete and not confirmed)
3. Gleason: NA
