Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the mention is about taking additional samples from a set, and focusing on the apex. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The previous report mentioned apex samples, but the current sample's origin isn't specified. So I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3, which is part of the Gleason scoring system. However, the current sample's summary says to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion might be cancer, but the current sample's findings aren't explicitly stated as malignant. Wait, the previous report had Gleason 3, but the current one is being re-examined. The problem states to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current report doesn't confirm malignancy but suggests re-examination, maybe the presence here is "ei" (no) or "NA". But the instructions say to report the worst lesion. The previous report had Gleason 3, which is part of a score, but if the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there was a previous suspicion. Hmm, this is tricky. The current sample's summary says to validate the original suspicion, which was Gleason 3. But the current sample's own findings aren't clear. Since the user wants the worst lesion from the current sample, and if the current sample's processing isn't conclusive, maybe the presence is "ei" or "NA". Wait, the original Finnish text says "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä oli maininnut Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" – a previous unfinished report mentioned Gleason 3. But the current sample is being re-examined. So the current sample's own findings might not have confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, the presence of malignancy here would be "ei" or "NA". But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the previous report had findings, but the current sample is being re-examined, maybe the current sample's result isn't confirmed. So the answer is "ei" or "NA". The problem states to report only the worst lesion's results. If the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, then "ei". But if the previous report's findings are considered part of the current case, maybe "kyllä". But the instructions say to process the given input text, which is the current report. The current report's YHTEENVETO says to re-examine to validate the original suspicion, implying that the current sample hasn't confirmed it yet. So maybe "ei" or "NA". The options for presence are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the current sample's data doesn't confirm malignancy, but the previous report did, but the current sample is part of the same case? The problem says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" for malignant cases. Since the current report mentions a previous Gleason 3, but the current sample is being re-examined, perhaps the malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason, but the current sample's own result isn't clear. Wait, the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – the worst lesion's results. If the previous report's Gleason 3 is part of the current case, then malignancy is "kyllä". But the current sample's data is the input. The input text is the current report, which refers to a previous report. So maybe the current sample's own findings are not confirming malignancy yet, hence "ei". But the presence of Gleason 3 in the previous report might indicate that malignancy exists. This is confusing. Maybe the answer here is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason, even if it's from a previous report. But the problem states to process the given input, which is the current report. The current report's own findings might not have confirmed malignancy yet, hence "ei". Alternatively, since the original suspicion is being validated, maybe the current sample hasn't found it yet, so "ei". But the presence of Gleason in the previous report might be part of the current case. Hmm. The problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" – so if the current sample's processing hasn't found malignancy, but there's a previous finding, should that be considered? The instructions might require considering only the current sample's data. In that case, if the current sample's report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei". But the text says "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti" – a previous unfinished report mentioned Gleason 3. The current sample is being re-examined to validate that. So the current sample's own result isn't clear yet. Therefore, the presence of malignancy in the current sample is "ei", but the previous one had it. But the problem says to process the given input, which is the current report. So maybe "ei" or "NA". But the options are "kyllä", "ei", "NA". Since the current report is about re-examining to validate, perhaps the current sample hasn't found malignancy yet, so "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". If the current sample's presence is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But the previous report had Gleason 3. However, the problem states to report the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample is being re-examined and the previous report's findings are mentioned but not confirmed in the current sample, the Gleason here would be "NA". 

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (not specified in the current report)
2. Malignant findings: ei (current sample hasn't confirmed, needs re-examination)
3. Gleason: NA (since no malignancy in current sample)
