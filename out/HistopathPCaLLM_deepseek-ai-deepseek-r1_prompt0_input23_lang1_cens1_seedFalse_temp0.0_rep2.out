Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the original report mentions "näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen siten, että keskitytään apeksiin" which translates to the sample needing reprocessing focusing on the apex. There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So I think the original type isn't specified here, hence NA.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the previous report mentioned "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä". Gleason scores are typically given as a sum of the two most common patterns, like 3+4=7. However, the text here only states grade 3, which might refer to the primary pattern. But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". Since only grade 3 is mentioned, maybe it's 3+3=6? But the original text says "luokan 3", which could mean the overall grade group 3, which is different. Wait, grade groups are different from Gleason scores. Grade group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7. Hmm, but the text says "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä", which might be translating to Gleason grade 3, which is part of the older system. In the older system, Gleason 3+3=6 is grade group 1. But the user might be expecting the sum here. Since the text mentions "Gleason luokan 3", maybe they just report the primary pattern as 3, but the required format is major+minor=sum. If only the primary is given, perhaps minor is also 3, making 3+3=6. Alternatively, if it's grade group 3, that's 4+3=7. But the text doesn't specify. The example in the instructions uses "major+minor=sum", so if the report only mentions grade 3, perhaps it's 3+3=6. But I need to check the original Finnish term. The Finnish term here is "Gleason luokan 3", which might correspond to the Grade Group 3, which is Gleason 4+3=7. However, Grade Groups are a newer classification, and the term "luokka" here might be referring to the Grade Group. But the user is asking for the Gleason score in the format of major+minor=sum. If the original report says "Gleason luokan 3", and if that's the Grade Group, then the corresponding Gleason score is 4+3=7. But without explicit mention of the score, it's ambiguous. However, the user might expect that if only a single number is given, it's the sum. But in reality, Gleason scores are always a sum of two numbers. So maybe the original report is incomplete, but according to the data extraction rules, we have to put it in major+minor=sum. If the text says "Gleason luokan 3", perhaps the correct interpretation is that the sum is 3, which isn't possible because Gleason scores start at 6 (3+3). Wait, maybe there's a translation error. In Finnish, "Gleason-luokka" might refer to the Grade Group. Grade Group 1 is Gleason 6 (3+3), Grade Group 2 is 3+4=7, Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7, etc. So if the report says Grade Group 3, then the Gleason score is 4+3=7. But the text here says "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä", which would be Grade Group 3, so 4+3=7. However, the user might not be aware of Grade Groups and expects the actual Gleason score. But the text doesn't specify the score, only the Grade Group. In that case, maybe the answer is NA because the sum isn't explicitly given. But the user instructions say to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. If the original text only mentions the Grade Group (luokka 3), but not the actual score, perhaps we can't determine the sum. However, the previous example in the instructions had "Gleason 3+4=7", so maybe the user expects that even if the original text mentions the Grade Group, we have to infer the sum. But this is unclear. Alternatively, maybe the original report mentions "Gleason luokan 3" which in Finnish terminology could mean the primary pattern is 3, but without the secondary, so we can't form the sum. In that case, maybe the answer is NA. But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so Gleason can't be NA. Wait, the third field is "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka" with allowed values "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the case is malignant, it should have a sum. But the text only mentions "Gleason luokan 3". If "luokka" here is the Grade Group, then the corresponding sum is 4+3=7. But how to confirm? The user might expect that if the report mentions a Gleason grade, even if it's the Grade Group, we have to map it to the sum. Alternatively, maybe the original report is using "Gleason luokka" to refer to the primary pattern. For example, primary pattern 3, but without the secondary. But in reality, Gleason scores require two numbers. So perhaps the original report is incomplete, but since the user wants the reported Gleason, we have to go with what's there. If it's written as "Gleason luokan 3", maybe the sum is 3, which is impossible. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 3+3=6. But without more info, perhaps the safest answer is NA, but that conflicts with the presence of malignancy. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 3+3=6, assuming that "luokan 3" refers to the primary and secondary patterns both being 3. But I'm not sure. This is a bit tricky. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to report the raportoitu Gleason-luokka, and since the text says "Gleason luokan 3", which is the Grade Group 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7, I think the correct sum is 4+3=7. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the original text is using "luokka" to mean the primary pattern, then it's 3, but the sum requires two numbers. Since the user example uses "3+4=7", maybe the answer here is "3+3=6" if the primary and secondary are both 3. But the text doesn't specify. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "3+3=6" because the previous report mentioned grade 3, which in the old system is 3+3=6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the report is incomplete, maybe the answer is NA. But the user says to report the Gleason for malignant cases. So perhaps the answer is "3+3=6" as the most likely, given that the text mentions "Gleason luokan 3" and assuming that refers to the sum. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is NA because the sum isn't explicitly given. But the user might expect that if a Gleason is mentioned, even partially, to report it. So perhaps "3+3=6" is the answer here.
