Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the mention is "Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen siten, että keskitytään apeksiin..." which translates to the sample needing reprocessing focusing on the apex. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The original report might not specify, so I might have to go with NA here.

Next, presence of malignant findings. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant. However, the current summary says they need to validate the original suspicion. So, the previous report had findings, but the current sample's conclusion isn't clear. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The current text mentions that the previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample's processing is to focus on the apex to validate the suspicion. So maybe the current sample's findings aren't confirmed yet. But the question is about the sample being processed now. The answer might be "kyllä" because Gleason 3 was mentioned, but since it's from a previous report, maybe the current sample's result isn't confirmed. Hmm. The YHTEENVETO (summary) says to reprocess the sample to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. So the current sample's analysis might not have found malignancy yet, but the previous one did. The question is about the current sample. Since the current sample's processing is to re-examine, maybe the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here. But the original text says "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä oli maininnut Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" – a previous incomplete report mentioned Gleason 3. So the current sample's findings aren't clear, but the previous one had Gleason 3. The user's instruction is to consider the worst lesion's results. But if the current sample is being reprocessed to validate, maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed yet. But the presence of Gleason 3 in the previous report might indicate that there were malignant findings. Wait, the question is about the sample in question. The text says "Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen..." so the current sample is being reprocessed. The previous report on apex samples mentioned Gleason 3. So the current sample's analysis might not have found malignancy yet, hence needing reprocessing. But the user wants the worst lesion's results. If the current sample's analysis hasn't found malignancy but the previous one did, but the current sample is different? Maybe the answer here is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason 3 in the previous report related to the apex, which is the focus now. But I'm a bit confused. The presence of malignancy in the sample being processed – if the sample is being reprocessed to validate, maybe the current sample's initial analysis didn't find it, but the suspicion exists. The answer might be "kyllä" because the previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample's result is pending. Wait, the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" – the worst lesion's results. So if the previous report had Gleason 3, and the current sample is being reprocessed to check, perhaps the worst is considered as Gleason 3. But the current sample's findings aren't clear. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason 3 in the previous report related to the same area (apex), which is now being re-examined. So the presence is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". Since the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but it's unclear if that's from the current sample. If the current sample's processing is to validate, maybe the Gleason here is not confirmed. But the user wants the worst lesion's results. If the previous report's Gleason 3 is the worst, then maybe it's 3+3=6. But the text says "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" – class 3, which in the old system could be pattern 3. But Gleason score is a sum of primary and secondary patterns. If it's class 3, maybe it's 3+3=6. So the answer would be "3+3=6". But the current sample's processing is to re-examine, so maybe the confirmed Gleason isn't available yet. However, the user wants the worst lesion's results. Since the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is part of the current case's suspicion, perhaps that's included. So the answer is "3+3=6".

But wait, the original text is in Finnish. "Gleason luokan 3" translates to "Gleason class 3", which might refer to the Gleason grade group 3, but that's a newer classification. However, grade groups are 1-5, where group 1 is Gleason 3+3=6, group 2 is 3+4=7, etc. If it's class 3, maybe it's grade group 3, which is 4+5=9. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe in the context, "luokka 3" refers to the primary pattern 3. But in the old Gleason scoring, the score is the sum of primary and secondary patterns. If the previous report mentions Gleason class 3 findings, perhaps it's primary pattern 3, but without the secondary, maybe it's 3+3=6. But the text isn't clear. However, since the user expects "major+minor=sum", and the example given is "3+4=7", perhaps in this case, since only class 3 is mentioned, it's 3+3=6. So the answer would be "3+3=6".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is being reprocessed, but the original type isn't specified. So "NA".

2. Malignant findings: The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is malignant. So "kyllä".

3. Gleason grade: "3+3=6".
