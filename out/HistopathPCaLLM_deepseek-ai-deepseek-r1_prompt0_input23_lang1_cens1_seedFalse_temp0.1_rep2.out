Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as coming from "apeksinäytteistä" which translates to apex samples. The previous report mentioned "Gleason luokka 3 löydöksiä" (Gleason grade 3 findings). Apex samples are typically taken via biopsy, so the original type here is likely biopsy. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text refers to "suspisio" (suspicion) and mentions Gleason grade 3, which is part of the Gleason scoring system for prostate cancer. Since Gleason grades are only applicable to malignant cases, the presence of a Gleason score indicates malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokka 3 löydöksiä". Gleason scores are usually a sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. However, the text only mentions grade 3. If there's only one grade reported, it's possible that both primary and secondary are 3, making the sum 3+3=6. But the user instructions specify the format as "major+minor=sum". Since the text doesn't explicitly state both grades, I need to be cautious. However, in some contexts, when only one grade is mentioned, it might be the primary, and the secondary is assumed or not specified. But without clear information, should I default to sum 3+3=6? The example given in the problem uses "3+4=7", so the format expects both parts. Since the text says "luokka 3", which could mean the primary pattern is 3, but the minor isn't mentioned. However, the user might consider that if only one grade is given, it's both major and minor. Alternatively, maybe the report is incomplete. But according to the data given, the previous report mentioned Gleason grade 3 findings. In clinical practice, Gleason score is a sum, so if only one component is mentioned, perhaps it's 3+3=6. But I need to check if the user expects that. Since the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers, and the example uses "3+4=7", I think the correct approach here is to assume that if only one grade is given, both are the same. So 3+3=6. Therefore, the Gleason grade would be "3+3=6".

Wait, but the text says "Gleason luokka 3". In some contexts, "luokka" might refer to the grade group, which is different from the Gleason score. Grade groups are 1-5, with Grade Group 1 being Gleason 3+3=6. But the user specifically asks for Gleason luokka in the format "major+minor=sum". So if the original text says "Gleason luokka 3", that might be the Grade Group, but the user wants the Gleason score. However, the example given in the problem statement uses "3+4=7", which is a Gleason score, not a Grade Group. So perhaps in this context, "luokka" refers to the score. But the text says "Gleason luokka 3 löydöksiä", which could be ambiguous. If the original report mentions Gleason grade 3, but doesn't specify if it's 3+3 or 3+something else, but in the absence of more information, maybe we have to put NA? But the user says for malignant cases, it should be the sum. Since the presence is "kyllä", the Gleason can't be NA. But if the data is incomplete, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, but the user instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)". So if it's malignant, we have to provide the sum. If the sum isn't reported, but only a single grade is mentioned, how to proceed? The example in the problem statement had "3+4=7", which is a sum. Here, the text says "Gleason luokka 3". If "luokka" here refers to the Grade Group (e.g., Grade Group 1 corresponds to Gleason 3+3=6), then the sum would be 6. But the user might expect the actual Gleason score. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the sum. So perhaps the correct answer here is "3+3=6" because the mention of Gleason grade 3 in the context of a previous report might imply 3+3. Alternatively, if the data is insufficient, maybe it's NA. But the user wants the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. Since the previous report mentioned Gleason grade 3 findings, and the current sample is being re-examined to validate the suspicion, perhaps the original Gleason was 3+3=6. Therefore, the answer would be "3+3=6".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy (since it's apex samples, typically from biopsy)
2. Malignancy: kyllä (since Gleason is mentioned)
3. Gleason: 3+3=6
