Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be TURP. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there's a malignant tumor. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later in the summary says "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is definitely yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The summary states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Gleason scores are typically given as the sum of the two most common grades. Since the sum is 8, the major and minor grades could be 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. However, the text earlier mentions Gleason 4-class tumor growth. If the sum is 8, and one of them is 4, the other would be 4 (4+4=8) or maybe 5+3. But the exact breakdown isn't specified here. Wait, the summary says "sum 8," so maybe the exact major and minor aren't detailed. But the user wants "major+minor=sum" as the format. The example given in the instructions is "major+minor=sum" with whole numbers. Since the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't explicitly stated, do I need to infer? The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, which might be the major pattern. If the major is 4 and the minor is 4, then 4+4=8. Alternatively, if the major is 4 and there's a higher grade elsewhere, but the sum is 8. However, the summary just says sum 8. The user might prefer the exact sum as given, but the format requires major and minor. Hmm. Wait, the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". So if the sum is provided as 8, but the individual grades aren't, maybe we can't split them. But the example in the instructions might expect that if the sum is given, but the individual grades aren't, then perhaps we should put "NA"? Wait, no. The user says "preferably" that format. So if the sum is given, but the major and minor aren't, maybe we can just put "sum 8" as the value. But the allowed values are preferably in "major+minor=sum" format. Wait, the example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum" as the format. So if the text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma," but doesn't specify the individual grades, how to handle that? The user might expect that if the sum is given, but the individual grades aren't, then perhaps we can't split them and should just put "8". But the allowed values for Gleason grade are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. Wait, the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign." So in this case, the statement is malignant, and the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified. However, earlier in the text, it mentions Gleason 4-class tumor growth in over 50% of the chippings. Since Gleason score is the sum of the most common and the second most common patterns. If the most common (major) is 4, and the second (minor) is 4, then 4+4=8. Alternatively, if the major is 4 and the minor is another 4, but maybe there's a tertiary pattern. But the summary says sum 8. So perhaps the correct way is to present it as "4+4=8" since the major is 4 (as mentioned in the text) and the sum is 8. But wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, which would be the major pattern. Then the minor would be 4 as well to sum to 8. So the Gleason grade would be 4+4=8. But the user might want exactly what's reported. The summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." So maybe the exact major and minor aren't given, just the sum. But the user's instruction says to report "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". If the sum is given but not the breakdown, should we just put "8" or "NA"? But the example in the instructions shows "major+minor=sum" as the format. Wait, the user's example in the problem statement might have been "major+minor=sum" like "3+4=7". So in this case, if the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, perhaps we can't fill in the major and minor. But the text does mention Gleason 4 in over 50%, which is the major. Then the minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). So maybe it's safe to put "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the user expects exactly what's written, the summary says "sum 8", so maybe the answer should be "8". But the user's instruction says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". So perhaps the correct approach is to infer the major and minor from the sum if possible. Since the sum is 8, possible combinations are 3+5, 5+3, 4+4. But the text mentions Gleason 4 in over 50%, which is the major. So major is 4, minor is 4. Therefore, "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text explicitly states the breakdown. The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, and the summary says "sum 8". So combining these, the major is 4, and the minor is 4. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: TURP (from "turp-chippings")
2. Malignant tumor: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
3. Gleason grade: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The user said not to have nested structures, so each field is a top-level key. Also, only the most severe lesion's results should be returned. Since the summary mentions sum 8, which is the highest in this case, that's the one to use.
