Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be TURP. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there's a malignant tumor. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later in the summary says "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is definitely yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The summary states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Gleason scores are typically given as the sum of the two most common grades. Since the sum is 8, the major and minor grades could be 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. However, the text earlier mentions Gleason 4-class tumor growth. If the major component is 4, then the minor would also be 4 to sum to 8. But I need to check if the text specifies. The summary says "sum 8," so without more details, the safest way is to present it as 4+4=8. Wait, but the mention of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" might indicate that the major pattern is 4, and the minor could be 4 as well. Alternatively, maybe the minor is 4. But since the sum is 8, and the main lesion is Gleason 4, perhaps the other part is also 4. So the Gleason grade should be 4+4=8. However, sometimes the major and minor could be different. But the text doesn't specify the individual grades beyond the sum. Wait, the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers". The example given in the problem statement is "major+minor=sum", so if the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified, should we put NA? Wait, no. The user says "for malignant statements" to provide the Gleason. Since the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", even if the individual grades aren't explicitly stated, the sum is 8. But the problem is that the Gleason grade in the structured data should be in the format of major+minor=sum. If the text only gives the sum, can we infer the major and minor? For example, if the sum is 8, possible combinations are 3+5, 4+4, 5+3. But the text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50% of the chippings. Since the major grade is the most common pattern, and if over 50% is Gleason 4, then the major is 4, and the minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). Therefore, the Gleason grade should be 4+4=8. So the answer here is "4+4=8".

Now, checking if there's a more severe lesion. The user says to take the most severe lesion. The summary mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which is the highest mentioned. The other part is Gleason 4, but the sum 8 is the final result, so that's the most severe.

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: TURP
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 4+4=8

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. So the keys are the three fields, each with their respective values. No nested objects, just a flat structure.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
