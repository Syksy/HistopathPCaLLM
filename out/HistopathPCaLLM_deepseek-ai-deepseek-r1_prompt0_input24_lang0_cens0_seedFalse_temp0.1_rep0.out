Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they're asking for. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text medical report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

Starting with the first field: original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the sample is described as "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP". That seems straightforward.

Next, the second field is whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later in the summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The summary clearly states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the example in the problem statement shows "4+3=7", so I need to check if the major and minor components are mentioned. The text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says sum 8. Wait, Gleason scores are sums of the two most prevalent grades. If the sum is 8, possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. But the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, which might be the major component. However, the summary says sum 8. Since the exact major and minor aren't specified, but the sum is given as 8, maybe the answer should be "4+4=8"? But the user wants the format as "major+minor=sum". Wait, the example in the problem statement uses "4+3=7", so perhaps the user expects the major and minor grades even if they have to infer them. However, the text here only mentions Gleason 4 in the main part, but the summary says sum 8. If the sum is 8 and the major component is 4, then minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the major is 5 and minor 3, but the text doesn't specify. The problem says to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" preferably. Since the summary states "sum 8", but the exact breakdown isn't provided, but in the main text it's Gleason 4. Wait, maybe the main lesion is Gleason 4, but the summary says sum 8. That might mean the major is 4 and minor is 4. But I need to check if the text provides both components. The main text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, which could be the major component. If the sum is 8, then the minor would be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. However, the exact breakdown isn't explicitly stated. The user might prefer to use the sum as given if the breakdown isn't clear, but the problem says to use "major+minor=sum" if possible. Since the sum is 8 and the main component is 4, perhaps the answer is "4+4=8". But I need to confirm if the text provides both grades. The main text mentions Gleason 4, and the summary says sum 8. If the sum is 8, and the major is 4, then minor must be 4. Alternatively, maybe the major is 5 and minor 3, but that's not mentioned. Since the problem says to take the most severe lesion, and the summary mentions sum 8, which is higher than 4, perhaps the breakdown is 4+4=8. But I'm not entirely sure. However, the user's example in the problem statement shows that when the sum is given, they use that. For instance, in the example, the answer is "4+3=7" when the text mentions Gleason 4 and 3. Here, the summary says "sum 8", but the breakdown isn't explicitly given. However, the main text mentions Gleason 4, which might be the major component, and the sum is 8. So perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the user expects only the sum when the breakdown isn't provided, but the problem says to use "major+minor=sum" preferably. Since the sum is 8, but the breakdown isn't clear, maybe the answer should be "4+4=8" as the most likely, given that the major component is 4. But I need to check if the text mentions both grades. The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50%, which would be the major component (since it's more than 50%). The sum is 8, so the minor component would be 4 (since 4+4=8). Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: TURP (from "turp-chippings")
2. Malignant tumor findings: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
3. Gleason grade: "4+4=8"

I need to ensure that the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The summary mentions the sum 8, which is the highest, so that's the one to report.
