Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, the first line mentions "turp-chippings." TURP is one of the allowed options, so that should be the answer here. The sample type is TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is definitely yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The summary states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Gleason scores are typically the sum of the two most prevalent grades. Since the sum is 8, the major and minor grades could be combinations like 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. However, the text specifically mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth. Also, in the summary, it's a re-evaluation leading to sum 8. If the major component is Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, then the minor must be 4 as well (4+4=8) or maybe 5. Wait, but the initial part says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" which might indicate the major pattern is 4. However, the summary says sum 8. So if the major is 4 and the sum is 8, the minor would have to be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe there's a higher grade. But the text doesn't specify the exact breakdown beyond the sum. But the user wants "major+minor=sum" as the format. Since the sum is 8, but the exact major and minor aren't given, but in the context, the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor growth might imply that's part of the score. However, the summary says sum 8. If the report states "sum 8," maybe the breakdown is 4+4=8. But I need to check if the text provides the individual grades. The original statement says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" but the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4, totaling 8. But sometimes, the highest grade is considered, but the user wants the major and minor. Since the exact breakdown isn't explicitly stated, but the sum is 8, maybe the answer should be "4+4=8" assuming that's the case. Alternatively, if the sum is given as 8 without the breakdown, maybe the answer is "NA"? But the user says for malignant statements, it's preferable to have "major+minor=sum". Since the sum is provided, but the individual grades aren't, but in the context, the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor growth might be part of the score. However, the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. If the individual grades aren't specified, but the sum is, perhaps the answer is "8" but the user wants "major+minor=sum". Wait, the allowed values for Gleason grade are preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So if the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't given, maybe the answer is "8". But the example format is "major+minor=sum", like "3+4=7". But in the given text, the summary says "sum 8", so maybe the correct format is "4+4=8" because the tumor growth was classified as Gleason 4, and the sum is 8. Alternatively, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. But without explicit mention of both grades, should I infer? The user says "reported Gleason grade". Since the report states "sum 8", but doesn't break it down into major and minor, perhaps the answer is "NA"? But the user says for malignant statements, it's preferable to have the sum. Wait, the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. If the sum is given but not the breakdown, maybe the answer is "8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Hmm. The example given in the instructions is "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. So if the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, perhaps the answer is "NA"? But the user says "preferably" that format. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8" as the sum. But the instructions say "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". So if the sum is provided but not the breakdown, maybe the answer is "NA"? But in the given text, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which explicitly states the sum. So perhaps the answer is "8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Wait, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given but not the breakdown, we should put "NA". But in the example, if the sum is given, even without breakdown, maybe we should put the sum. But the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. Wait, maybe the user wants the sum as the value. For example, if the sum is 8, then the answer is "8". But the example given in the instructions is "major+minor=sum" like "3+4=7". So perhaps the correct way is to write "4+4=8" if that's the case. But the text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and the sum is 8. So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. Therefore, the answer would be "4+4=8". However, the text doesn't explicitly state both grades, only the sum. But in the summary, it's "sum 8". So maybe the correct answer is "4+4=8" assuming that the major and minor are both 4. Alternatively, if the major is 5 and minor is 3, but that's not mentioned. Since the text mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth, perhaps that's the major component, and the minor is 4. So I think the answer should be "4+4=8".
