Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the summary clearly says "sum 8". The format requested is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason 4, but since the sum is 8, the major and minor grades would add up to that. Typically, Gleason 4+4=8, but the exact breakdown isn't specified here. However, the user wants the format as major+minor=sum, so "4+4=8" is the correct entry. Wait, but the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and then sum 8. Maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4? Or maybe 4 and another grade? But the summary states sum 8, so regardless of individual grades, the sum is 8. However, the allowed value is preferably "major+minor=sum". The example given in the problem statement uses "major+minor=sum" as the format. The text mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth, but the summary says sum 8. So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4, making 8. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the initial part says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and the summary says sum 8. Maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. Alternatively, maybe there's a higher grade. But without explicit mention of both grades, should I assume? The user says to report the sum. But the allowed values prefer "major+minor=sum". Since the sum is 8, and the text mentions Gleason 4, perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4. But maybe the major is 5 and minor is 3? Wait, no. The sum is 8. The most common combinations are 5+3=8 or 4+4=8. However, the text specifically mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth. So maybe it's 4+4=8. But the user wants the reported Gleason grade as per the text. The summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", so the exact breakdown isn't given. But the problem states to report "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers". If the sum is given but not the breakdown, should we just put "8"? But the example in the problem uses "major+minor=sum" like "3+4=7". Wait, the user says "preferably" that format. If the breakdown isn't specified but the sum is, maybe we can just put "8". But the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. Hmm. The example given in the problem statement for Gleason grade is "3+4=7". So perhaps even if the sum is given, we need to infer the major and minor. But in the provided text, the summary says "sum 8", and earlier mentions Gleason 4. So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. So "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the report doesn't specify, but the sum is 8, maybe we should just put "8". But the user's instruction says preferably "major+minor=sum". So perhaps the correct way is to put "4+4=8" since the tumor growth is classified as Gleason 4, and the sum is 8. But wait, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. Alternatively, maybe the major is 5 and minor is 3, but the text doesn't say that. The text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50% of the chippings, which might refer to the major pattern. Then the minor could be another pattern adding up to 8. If major is 4, minor would be 4 (4+4=8). So that's likely the case. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: TURP
2. Malignant tumor: yes
3. Gleason grade: 4+4=8
