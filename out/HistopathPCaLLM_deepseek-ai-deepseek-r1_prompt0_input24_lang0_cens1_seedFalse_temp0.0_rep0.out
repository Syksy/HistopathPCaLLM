Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided text about prostate cancer histopathological statements. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." So the samples include biopsies and radical prostatectomies. But the instructions say to take the most severe lesion's result. However, the original sample type isn't about severity but the type. The problem is the text says "samples consisted of multiple sets" including biopsies and RPs. But the task is to pick one. Since the example in the text later mentions "teaching material" which might not be a specific case, but the first part lists the sample types. However, the answer might need to be NA if it's a mix. Wait, the first line says "samples consisted of multiple sets of patients, from whom biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings had been available post-benign diagnosis." So the original samples are a mix of biopsy, RP, and shavings (TURP is a type of shaving maybe?). But the allowed values don't include shavings. Wait, TURP is transurethral resection of the prostate, which is a type of procedure that might produce shavings. So maybe "shavings" here refer to TURP. But the original sample types are multiple, so how to choose? The instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." But sample type isn't about severity. Maybe the answer is NA because there are multiple types. But the allowed values include biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since the samples include biopsies and RPs, but the text is about teaching material that includes various types, perhaps the original sample type can't be determined as a single value, so NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions that in 1/4 of cases, benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. So some cases became malignant. The re-evaluation showed no upgrading to GG 3 or above. Wait, GG 3 is Gleason grade group 3, which would be Gleason 4+3=7 or higher. But the text says "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4." So 3+3 is Gleason 6 (grade group 1), and 3+4 is Gleason 7 (grade group 2). The re-evaluation says no upgrading to GG 3 or above, so the highest is 3+4. So there are malignant findings (since Gleason 3+3 and 3+4 are considered cancer). So the answer here is "yes" because some cases were upgraded to malignant.

Third, reported Gleason grade. The highest mentioned is 3+4=7. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The text says "at most 3+4" and "resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6." So the maximum is 3+4=7. But the example given is Gleason 6 (3+3). However, the most severe would be 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7". But the user says preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So "3+4=7".

Wait, but the re-evaluation showed no upgrading to GG 3 or above. GG 3 is Gleason grade group 3, which is 4+3=7, 8, etc. But the text says the upgrades were to 3+3 or 3+4. So 3+4 is grade group 2. So the highest is 3+4=7. So the Gleason grade should be 3+4=7. But the example in the text says "e.g. Gleason 6" which is 3+3. But the most severe is 3+4. So the answer is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: The samples are a mix (biopsy, RP, TURP/shavings), so NA.
2. Malignant findings: Yes, because some were upgraded to Gleason scores indicating cancer.
3. Gleason grade: 3+4=7.

Check if the answer should be the highest reported. The text says "at most 3+4" so that's the highest. So yes.
