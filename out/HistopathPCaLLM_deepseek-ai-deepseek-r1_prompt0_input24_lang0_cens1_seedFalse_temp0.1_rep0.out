Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." So the samples include biopsies and RP. But the question says to take the most severe lesion's result. However, the sample type isn't specified per lesion here. The text says "samples consisted of multiple sets" from different procedures. Since there's a mix, maybe the original sample type can't be determined definitively. So maybe NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions that in some cases, benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. Upgrading to Gleason scores implies malignancy. Also, the summary says "few cases upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6." Gleason 6 is considered low-grade cancer. So there were malignant findings. So answer "yes".

For Gleason grade, the highest mentioned is 3+4=7. But the re-evaluation showed no upgrading to GG 3 or above. Wait, GG 3 is Grade Group 3, which corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7. Wait, maybe the text says that in the re-evaluation, there was no upgrading to GG3 or above, meaning the highest after re-eval is GG2 (Gleason 3+4=7 is GG2). Wait, no. Wait, Grade Groups: GG1 is 3+3=6, GG2 is 3+4=7, GG3 is 4+3=7, GG4 is 8, and GG5 is 9-10. The original text says "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". So the highest is 3+4=7 (GG2). Then the re-evaluation showed no upgrading to GG3 or above, so the highest after re-eval is still 3+4=7. But the summary mentions "resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6." Gleason 6 is 3+3. So the most severe lesion would be 3+4=7. But the user wants the most severe lesion's Gleason grade. So the answer should be "3+4=7". However, the instructions say to report "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So "3+4=7". But the example in the problem statement says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "in around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4". So the most severe is 3+4=7. Then the re-evaluation showed no upgrading to GG3 or above, which would be 4+3=7 or higher. So the highest after re-evaluation is still 3+4=7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is 3+4=7.
