Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the type here should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaksi", which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor. Also, there's a reference to Gleason 4, which is part of the grading for prostate cancer. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The summary states "pistesumman 8", which translates to a total score of 8. The report mentions Gleason 4, but since the total is 8, the other component must be Gleason 4 as well (4+4=8). However, I need to check if there's a mention of major and minor components. The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". It's possible that both primary and secondary patterns are 4, leading to 4+4=8. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

I should also ensure that there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is a top-level key. Let me double-check the original text for any nuances. The mention of "kroonistunutta tulehdussolukkoa" is chronic inflammation, which is benign, but the main finding is malignant. Since the task is to report the worst lesion, the adenocarcinoma with Gleason 8 is the key point.

Everything seems to align. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is present, and Gleason score is 4+4=8.
