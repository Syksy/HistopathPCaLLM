Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the original type should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report talks about "adenokarsinooma", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). Even though there's mention of chronic inflammation, the key point is the adenocarcinoma, which is malignant.

For the Gleason grade, the summary says "pistesumman 8". Gleason scores are typically given as the sum of the primary and secondary patterns. The text also mentions Gleason 4, but in the summary, the total is 8. However, since the user wants the major and minor components, I need to check if the report specifies both. The main tumor here is Gleason 4, but the total is 8, which would imply 4 + 4 = 8. But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". So the total is 8. But the problem is that the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". The example given in the instructions is "3+4=7", so I need to see if the major and minor components are specified. The text mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which is the major pattern. But to get a sum of 8, the minor would also be 4. So it's 4+4=8. However, the report might not explicitly state both. The summary just says the total is 8, so maybe the major and minor aren't both given. But in the details, it says "Gleason 4" and the total is 8. So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4. So the answer would be "4+4=8". But I need to make sure that the report doesn't mention another pattern. The text also says "yhteensulaneina asinuksina", which might refer to fused glands, typical of pattern 4. There's no mention of pattern 5, so likely 4+4=8. 

So putting it all together:
1. Original type: TURP
2. Malignancy: kyllä
3. Gleason: 4+4=8

  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
