Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja," which translates to TURP chips. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and "adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma), which is a type of cancer. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma with a score of 8). The Gleason score is typically the sum of the major and minor patterns. Here, the total is 8. However, the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" (Gleason grade 4 tumor growth). Since Gleason scores are combinations of two grades, and the total is 8, the major and minor could be 4+4=8. But sometimes it's 5+3 or 3+5. Wait, the example given in the user's instructions uses "major+minor=sum" format. The text here says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. However, the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor growth might refer to the primary pattern. If the total is 8 and one of them is 4, the other would also be 4 (4+4=8). But the user wants the format as "major+minor=sum". So the answer here should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the user's example in the instructions shows "3+4=7" as a possible value. So the correct format is combining the major and minor grades. The text mentions "Gleason 4" in the tumor growth, which might be the major pattern, but the total is 8. So if major is 4, minor must be 4. Therefore, "4+4=8".

But let me double-check. The report says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi" which translates to "adenocarcinoma with a score of 8". The Gleason score is the sum of the two most prevalent patterns. If the total is 8, and the main pattern mentioned is Gleason 4, then the other must be 4. So yes, 4+4=8. 

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: TURP
2. Malignant findings: kyllä
3. Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions "pahimman leesion" so we take the highest Gleason score reported, which is 8 here. The other findings like chronic inflammation are benign and not relevant here. The answer should be straightforward.
