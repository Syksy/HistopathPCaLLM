Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja", which translates to TURP chips. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and "adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma), which is a type of cancer. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the summary states "pistesumman 8". Gleason scores are typically given as a sum of the primary and secondary grades. Here, the total is 8. The text also mentions Gleason 4, but since the sum is 8, the other component must be 4 (4+4=8). However, the exact major and minor might not be specified, but the sum is clearly 8. The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth and the summary confirms the sum of 8, so that's the highest. Other findings like chronic inflammation don't affect the malignancy determination here.

Finally, structure the JSON without nested structures. Check the allowed values again to confirm. All entries seem to fit: TURP, kyllä, 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+4=8"
}
```
