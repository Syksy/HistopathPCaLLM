Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja", which translates to TURP chips. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and "adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma), which is a type of cancer. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the summary states "pistesumman 8". Gleason scores are typically given as the sum of the primary and secondary patterns. Here, the total is 8. The text also mentions Gleason 4, but since the sum is 8, the primary and secondary grades would be 4 and 4 (4+4=8). However, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". So the answer should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported. The report mentions Gleason 4 tumor growth and a sum of 8, which aligns with the highest grade mentioned. There's no mention of higher grades, so 4+4=8 is correct. The other findings like chronic inflammation don't affect the malignancy determination here.

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason sum is 8. All fields are filled correctly without nested structures. The JSON syntax should be valid.
