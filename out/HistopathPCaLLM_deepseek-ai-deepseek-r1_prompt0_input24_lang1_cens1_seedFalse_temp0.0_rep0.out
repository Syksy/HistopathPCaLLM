Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here: "biopsioita" is biopsies, "radikaaleja prostatektomioita" translates to radical prostatectomies (RP), and "höyläyksiä" likely refers to TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The report says the samples are from multiple patients with these types. But the question is about the original sample type. However, since the text refers to multiple samples of different types, and there's no single sample specified, maybe the answer here is NA. Because the data isn't about a single sample but a collection for training.

Second, presence of malignant findings. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" which means after a benign diagnosis. But then it says some benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4. However, the re-evaluation didn't lead to benign cases being upgraded to GG3 or higher. The summary also mentions cases where there was an increase to Gleason 6 (which is 3+3). Wait, Gleason 6 is considered low-grade cancer. So if some cases were upgraded to Gleason 6, that would indicate malignancy. But the original diagnosis was benign. The key here is whether the samples had malignant findings. The text says "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So some benign cases were reclassified as Gleason 3+3 (which is cancer) or 3+4. Therefore, there are malignant findings in some samples. But the question is whether the sample (the one being processed) has malignant findings. However, the text is about a collection of samples used for training. The user wants the worst lesion's results. Since some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, which are malignant, the presence of malignancy would be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum. For benign, it's NA. Since there are malignant cases (Gleason 3+3=6 and 3+4=7), the worst would be 3+4=7. But the text says "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" (up to 3+4). Also, "uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan" – so re-evaluation didn't lead to upgrading benign to GG3 or higher. Wait, GG3 is Grade Group 3, which corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. But the text mentions cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 (GG1) or 3+4 (GG2). The highest here is 3+4=7 (GG2). But the user asks for the worst lesion's Gleason. So the answer would be 3+4=7. However, the summary mentions "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. But the example says "esim." (for example), so there are higher cases. The key is "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" – up to 3+4. So the worst is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instructions say to return the worst lesion's results. So even if some are 3+3 and some 3+4, the worst is 3+4=7. So the answer for Gleason is "3+4=7".

Now, putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The text refers to multiple sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP), but since it's a collection for training and not a single sample, the original type isn't specified. So answer NA.

2. Malignant findings: Yes, because some were upgraded to Gleason scores indicating cancer.

3. Gleason: 3+4=7.

Wait, but the text says "nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So the maximum is 3+4=7. So that's the worst. So the answer is 3+4=7.
