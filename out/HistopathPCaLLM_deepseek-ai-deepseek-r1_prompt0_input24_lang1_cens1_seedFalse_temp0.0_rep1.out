Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here: "biopsioita" is biopsies, "radikaaleja prostatektomioita" is radical prostatectomies (RP), and "höyläyksiä" likely refers to TURP. However, the text says the samples are from multiple patients and were used for training. Since it's a collection of various sample types, but the question asks for the original type of the sample. The report is a summary of multiple cases, so there's no single sample type. Therefore, the answer here should be NA.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions that some benign cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. However, it also states that re-evaluation didn't lead to benign cases being upgraded to GG3 or higher. Gleason 6 (3+3) is considered low-grade cancer, so even though it's low grade, it's still malignant. The cases that were upgraded to Gleason 6 would be malignant. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason 3+3 and 3+4. Since we need the worst lesion's result, the highest mentioned here is 3+4=7. However, the report says that in some cases, benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4. But the re-evaluation didn't lead to GG3 or higher. Wait, GG3 in the new grading system is equivalent to Gleason 3+4=7. But the text says "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. Also, "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" (up to 3+4). However, the re-evaluation didn't result in benign being upgraded to GG3 or higher. So the highest reported is 3+4=7. But the summary says "johti jokuseen tapaukseen jossa nousu esim. Gleason 6:een". So some cases were upgraded to 6 (3+3), and some up to 3+4. But the worst would be 3+4=7. However, the user instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. But the text also mentions that the re-evaluation didn't lead to benign being upgraded to GG3 or higher. Wait, GG3 is 3+4=7. So if the re-evaluation didn't result in GG3 or higher, but some cases were upgraded to 3+4, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe there's confusion between the old Gleason scores and the new Grade Groups. Grade Group 1 is Gleason 6 (3+3), Group 2 is 3+4=7, Group 3 is 4+3=7, etc. The text says "ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan" which translates to "did not lead to upgrading benign to GG3 or higher". So GG3 is Grade Group 3, which is Gleason 4+3=7. Therefore, the highest allowed in the cases was up to 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). So the worst Gleason here is 3+4=7. But the example in the summary mentions "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een", which is 3+3=6. So there are cases with 3+3 and some with 3+4. The worst is 3+4=7, so that should be reported. But the answer needs to be the worst lesion's Gleason. However, the text says "noin 1/4:stä tapauksista, benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So the maximum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But wait, the re-evaluation didn't lead to GG3 or higher. So if 3+4=7 is Grade Group 2, then it's allowed. So the answer is 3+4=7. But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. So even if some cases had 3+4, that's the maximum here. So the Gleason is 3+4=7. But the example in the summary says "esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3. But the text also mentions "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So the worst is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer for Gleason should be "3+4=7". But wait, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" because Gleason 6 and 7 are malignant. So the third field is "3+4=7". But the user instructions say that for non-malignant cases, it's NA. Since here malignancy is present, we report the Gleason. So the answer is 3+4=7. But I need to check the text again. The original samples were benign, but after re-evaluation, some were upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3) or up to 3+4. So the malignant findings are present. Therefore, the Gleason is the highest reported, which is 3+4=7.
