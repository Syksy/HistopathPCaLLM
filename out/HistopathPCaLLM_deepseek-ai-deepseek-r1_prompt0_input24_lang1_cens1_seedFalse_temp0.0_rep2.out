Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms translate to biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TURPs. However, the sample here is part of a training material collected from multiple patients with different procedures. Since the samples are from various sources and it's not specified which one is the current sample, the original type isn't clear for a single case. So, the answer here should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states that some benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4. Gleason 3+3 is considered low-grade cancer, so that's malignant. Even though it's low grade, it's still cancer. The summary also mentions cases rising to Gleason 6 (which is 3+3). So, there are malignant findings. Hence, the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the highest reported here is 3+4. The text says "korkeintaan 3+4" (at most 3+4), and in the summary, "esim. Gleason 6:een" (for example, to Gleason 6). Gleason 6 is 3+3. However, the highest mentioned is 3+4. Since we need the worst lesion's result, the maximum is 3+4=7. But wait, the user instructions say to report the major + minor = sum as integers. So, if the highest is 3+4, that's 3+4=7. However, the text also mentions that re-evaluation never led to upgrading to GG3 or higher. GG3 in the new grading system is equivalent to Gleason 3+4. Wait, but the original grading here might be using the old system. The example given is Gleason 6 (3+3) and up to 3+4. So the worst case here is 3+4=7. But the answer should be in "major+minor=sum" format. So the value would be "3+4=7". However, the user specifies the format as "major+minor=sum" with integers. So the correct format is "3+4=7". But I need to check if the text explicitly mentions any case with 3+4. The text says "korkeintaan 3+4" (at most 3+4), so the worst is 3+4. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".
