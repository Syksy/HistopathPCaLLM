Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here translate to biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TURPs. However, the report states that the samples are from multiple patients and are used for training. Since it's a collection of various sample types and not a single specified type, the original sample type isn't clear for a single case. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" which means after a benign diagnosis. However, it also mentions that some benign materials were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. Gleason 3+3 is considered low-grade cancer, so that's malignant. But the summary says "benignin nostoon GG 3:een" which might be confusing. Wait, GG 3 is Gleason 3+4=7, which is still malignant. But the key point is that the re-evaluation didn't lead to benign cases being upgraded to GG3 or higher. Wait, the original text says "noin 1/4:stä tapauksista, benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So some cases originally benign were reclassified as Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. Both of these are malignant. However, the summary says "uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan". GG3 is Grade Group 3, which is Gleason 4+3=7. So the re-evaluation didn't upgrade benign to GG3 or higher, but some were upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3) or 3+4 (GG2). So there are malignant findings (Gleason 6 and 3+4) present in the samples. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the highest reported here is 3+4=7. But the instruction says to report the worst lesion's result. The text mentions "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi", meaning up to 3+4. So the highest would be 3+4=7. However, the summary also says "johti jokuseen tapaukseen jossa nousu esim. Gleason 6:een". So some cases were upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3). But the worst is 3+4. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7". 

Wait, but the user specified that for Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum". So if the worst is 3+4, then it's 3+4=7. However, the answer should be a string in that format. So the third field is "3+4=7". But need to check if the samples with malignancy have this. Since some cases were upgraded to 3+3 or 3+4, the worst is 3+4=7. So that's the value.
