Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here: "biopsioita" is biopsies, "radikaaleja prostatektomioita" refers to radical prostatectomies (RP), and "höyläyksiä" likely means TURP. However, the text says the samples are from multiple patients and include these types. But the original sample type for the report isn't specified for a single case. Since it's a collection for training, maybe the original type isn't specified here. So the answer might be NA.

Second, malignant findings. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions that some benign cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. But "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". Wait, Gleason 3+3 is considered cancer (Grade Group 1), but the text says "benigni materiaali" (benign material) was upgraded to these. That seems contradictory. Maybe there were cases initially thought benign but later found to have low-grade cancer. However, the summary says "johti jokuseen tapaukseen jossa nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" (Gleason 6 is 3+3). So there were malignant findings in some cases. But the question is whether the sample had malignant findings. The text is about training material where some cases turned out to have malignancy upon re-evaluation. However, the user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since some cases had Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, which are malignant, but the overall sample includes multiple cases. Wait, the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). But the text is about a collection of samples from multiple patients. The user might be expecting that since some cases had malignancy, but the answer is for the sample in question. Wait, the input is a single report, but the report describes multiple samples. The instructions might be ambiguous here. However, the example text says "YHTEENVETO: Opetusmateriaali useammalta potilaalta..." which is a summary of training material from multiple patients. So perhaps the sample type is NA because it's a collection, and the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" because some cases had it. But the third question about Gleason grade would then take the highest reported, which is 3+4=7. But the text says "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" (up to 3+4). So the worst is 3+4=7. However, the summary mentions "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" (Gleason 6 is 3+3=6). So the highest is 3+4=7. But the answer should be the worst lesion's Gleason. So the third field would be "3+4=7". But the user instructions say that for non-malignant cases, it's NA. Since there are malignant cases (Gleason 6 and 7), the answer should include the highest sum. 

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The original sample types are biopsies, RPs, and TURPs, but the report is a collection for training. Since it's multiple types, maybe the answer is NA.
2. Malignant findings: Yes, because some cases were upgraded to Gleason scores.
3. Gleason grade: The highest mentioned is 3+4=7, so "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So the original material was benign, but upon re-evaluation, some were upgraded. So the presence of malignancy is "kyllä" because there were malignant findings in some samples. The worst Gleason is 3+4=7. 

So the JSON should be:

{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuisia": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuisia": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
