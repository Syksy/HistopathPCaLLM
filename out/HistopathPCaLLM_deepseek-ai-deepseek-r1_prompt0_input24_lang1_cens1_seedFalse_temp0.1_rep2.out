Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms translate to biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TURPs. However, the report says the samples are from multiple patients with these different types. Since the question asks for the sample type of the specimen in question, but the text refers to a collection of various samples for training purposes, there's no single sample type specified here. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The text mentions "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" which means after a benign diagnosis. However, it also says that some benign materials were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. Gleason 3+3 is considered low-grade cancer, so that's malignant. But the summary says "benignin nostoon GG 3:een" which might be confusing. Wait, GG 3 is Gleason grade group 3, which is Gleason 4+3. But the text says "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. However, the key point is that the original diagnosis was benign, but upon re-evaluation, some cases were upgraded. So the specimens in question had malignant findings (Gleason 6 is cancer). But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Since some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, which are malignant, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The text mentions cases upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4. The worst here is 3+4=7. However, the summary says "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. But the example in the summary is just an example. The main text says "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" which means up to 3+4. So the worst is 3+4=7. But the user wants the major + minor = sum. So the answer should be "3+4=7". However, the instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. But the text also says "Uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan." GG3 is grade group 3, which is 4+3=7. So the worst is 3+4=7 (grade group 2). Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the initial cases were benign, then some were upgraded. So the malignant cases have Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. The worst is 3+4=7. So the answer is "3+4=7".
