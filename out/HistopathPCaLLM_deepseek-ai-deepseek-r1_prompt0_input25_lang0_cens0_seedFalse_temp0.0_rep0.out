Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement, it mentions "tissue cylinders" in samples 1 and 2. Tissue cylinders are typically obtained via biopsy, as that's a common method for obtaining such samples. RP and TURP are surgical procedures, but the description here doesn't mention surgery, just the samples. So I think the original sample type is biopsy.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The conclusion states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. In sample 1, the Gleason patterns mentioned are 4 (20%) and 3 (30%). The major pattern is the higher grade, which is 4, and the minor is 3. So it should be 4+3=7. Even though sample 2 has Gleason 4 and 3 as well, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. Both samples 1 and 2 have the same Gleason sum, but maybe the percentage of pattern 4 is higher in sample 1 (20% vs 15% in sample 2). However, the highest Gleason grade is the same. Wait, but the major component is the higher grade, so both would be 4+3=7. Since they are the same, either could be considered, but the user says "most severe lesion." Maybe the one with the higher percentage of pattern 4? Sample 1 has 20% vs 15% in sample 2. So sample 1's Gleason would be the most severe. So the answer is 4+3=7.

Double-checking: Sample 3 is benign, but samples 1 and 2 are malignant. The conclusion confirms adenocarcinoma. So malignant is yes. Original sample type is biopsy. Gleason 4+3=7. All fields should be filled accordingly.
