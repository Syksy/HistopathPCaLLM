Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement, it mentions "tissue cylinders" in samples 1 and 2. Tissue cylinders are typically obtained via biopsy, as that's a common method for obtaining such samples. RP and TURP are surgical procedures, but the description here doesn't mention surgery, just the samples. So I think the original sample type is biopsy.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The conclusion states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report mentions in sample (1) Gleason 4 and 3 patterns. The higher grade is 4, so major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Even though sample (2) also has Gleason 4 and 3, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Both samples 1 and 2 have the same sum, but maybe the percentages? Sample 1 has 20% Gleason 4 and 30% 3, while sample 2 has 15% 4 and less than 35% 3. But Gleason grading is based on the primary and secondary patterns, not the percentage. So the highest grade would still be 4+3=7. So the answer should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the user said "only the results from the most severe lesion." If both samples 1 and 2 have Gleason 4+3=7, then either is acceptable. But maybe the highest percentage? Or is there a different way to determine severity? The Gleason score is determined by the sum, so 4+3=7 is the same as 3+4=7, but the primary pattern (the higher one) matters. Wait, no, the primary is the most prevalent, but in the report, sample 1 has 20% Gleason 4 and 30% Gleason 3. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the primary pattern is the one with the higher grade, not the higher percentage. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common (primary) and the next most common (secondary), but if the highest grade is present, even if it's less in percentage, it's considered. Wait, I need to recall the Gleason grading rules. The current system (Grade Groups) considers the primary and secondary patterns, where the primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if there's a higher grade pattern, even if it's less extensive, it might still be considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next. But if there's a higher grade that's less common, does that affect the score? For example, if there's 60% pattern 3 and 40% pattern 4, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. If it's 40% pattern 4 and 60% pattern 3, it's 4+3=7. So the order matters based on the percentage. Wait, no, the primary is the pattern that is most prevalent, and the secondary is the next. So in sample 1, the report says "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." So the most prevalent is pattern 3 (30%) and then pattern 4 (20%). So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the way it's written in the sample is "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." Maybe the pathologist is indicating that the primary is 4 and secondary is 3, but the percentages are 20% and 30%? That would be conflicting. Wait, perhaps there's a typo or misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the sample statement.

"In the longer one, approximately 4mm in length (about half of total length) contains tumor growth, with Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." So the way it's written is "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." So the primary pattern is 4 (20%) and secondary is 3 (30%). But that's not how Gleason scoring works. The primary is the most extensive, so if pattern 3 is 30% and pattern 4 is 20%, then the primary is 3, secondary is 4, making it 3+4=7. However, the way it's phrased here might be that the pathologist is listing the highest grade first, regardless of percentage. This is a possible point of confusion. In some reporting styles, the higher grade is listed first even if it's less in percentage. For example, if there's 20% pattern 4 and 30% pattern 3, the Gleason score would be 4+3=7, but according to current guidelines, it should be the most prevalent pattern first. So this is ambiguous. However, the user's instruction says to take the most severe lesion. If the most severe is the highest Gleason score, then 4+3=7 and 3+4=7 are both sum 7, but the Grade Group would differ. Grade Group 2 is 3+4=7, and Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. So the Grade Group is different based on the order. Therefore, the most severe would be 4+3=7. But how is that determined from the text? The sample says "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." If the pathologist is reporting the primary as 4 and secondary as 3, then it's 4+3=7. But according to the percentages, the primary should be 3. This is a possible error in the original text or a misunderstanding. However, as a data structuring algorithm, I should follow what's written. The text explicitly states "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." So the primary is 4, secondary is 3, leading to 4+3=7. Similarly, sample (2) has "differentiation stage Gleason 4 approx 15% and 3 stage less than 35%." So again, primary 4 and secondary 3. So both samples 1 and 2 have 4+3=7. Therefore, the most severe is 4+3=7. So the answer should be "4+3=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy (since tissue cylinders are from biopsy)
2. Malignant tumor: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
3. Gleason grade: 4+3=7
