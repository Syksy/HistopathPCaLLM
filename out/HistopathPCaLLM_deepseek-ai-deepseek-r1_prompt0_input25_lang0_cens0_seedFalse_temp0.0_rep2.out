Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the samples are referred to as "tissue cylinders" in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3. The term "tissue cylinders" is commonly associated with biopsy samples, especially in prostate cancer diagnostics. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP procedures here. So, the original sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignant tumor findings. The conclusion states "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Even though samples 1 and 2 mention PIN-changes (which are pre-malignant), the conclusion confirms malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to report the most severe lesion. The Gleason score is typically the sum of the most prevalent (major) and the second most prevalent (minor) patterns. In sample 1, the major pattern is 4 (20%) and minor is 3 (30%). The sum would be 4+3=7. In sample 2, it's 4 (15%) and 3 (less than 35%), so again 4+3=7. Both samples have the same Gleason score. Since the most severe is the same in both, we can report "4+3=7". The third sample is benign, so it doesn't affect the result. The answer should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure the JSON is valid without nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion's data is used. All three fields are addressed correctly. Let me double-check the allowed values and the report content to confirm.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```
