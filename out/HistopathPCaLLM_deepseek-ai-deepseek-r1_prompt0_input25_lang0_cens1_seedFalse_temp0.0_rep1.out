Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "multi-faceted tissue sample shapes" and "fragmented tissue material." These terms are a bit vague. Biopsy samples are usually small, while TURP specimens are often fragmented. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type. Since it's not clear, I think the safest answer here is "NA" because the text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The conclusion states that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma can't be reliably verified. The initial suspicion of PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes was retracted. Since PIN is not malignant and the final conclusion is uncertainty, the malignant finding isn't confirmed. So, the answer here should be "no" because there's no confirmation of malignancy, but wait, the conclusion says they can't verify presence or absence. Hmm, maybe "NA" is more appropriate here because the report is inconclusive. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report can't confirm either presence or absence, does that mean it's NA? Because "no" would imply absence, but the report says it's not reliable. So, yes, "NA" is correct here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. The text mentions that in sample (1), all of it could be assessed for Gleason patterns, but due to differing views, it's going to be discussed at a meeting. However, the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be verified. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even though they assessed differentiation patterns, the final result is inconclusive, so no Gleason score is reported.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid with no nested structures. Check the instructions again to confirm only the most severe lesion is considered. Since all samples are inconclusive, there's no severe lesion to report. So all fields should be NA.
