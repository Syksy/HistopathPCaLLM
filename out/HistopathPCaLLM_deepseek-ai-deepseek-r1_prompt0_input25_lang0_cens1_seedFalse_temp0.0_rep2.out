Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "multi-faceted tissue sample shapes" and "fragmented tissue material." These terms are a bit vague. Biopsy samples are usually small, while TURP specimens are often fragmented. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type. Since it's not clear, I think the safest answer here is "NA" because the text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, the presence of malignant tumors. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that samples (1) and (2) initially had PIN changes (which are pre-malignant) but were retracted. The conclusion states that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma can't be reliably verified. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and the previous suspicion was retracted, the answer here should be "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy, but wait, the conclusion says it can't be verified. Hmm, maybe "NA" is more appropriate here because the report is inconclusive. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If it's inconclusive, does that count as NA? The question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they retracted the initial suspicion and can't confirm, maybe "no" because there's no positive finding. But the conclusion says they can't verify presence or absence. So maybe "NA" because it's uncertain. But the allowed values don't have an uncertain option. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says the presence or absence can't be reliably verified. So perhaps "NA" is correct here because the determination isn't possible from the samples provided.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed (as per the second point), the Gleason grade should be "NA". However, the first sample mentions that "approximately all of it could be assessed in respect to its Gleason differentiation patterns," but due to differing views, it's going to be discussed. So even though they looked at Gleason patterns, the conclusion is that they can't verify adenocarcinoma. Therefore, since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since the procedure type isn't specified)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (since the conclusion is inconclusive)
3. Gleason grade: NA (because malignancy isn't confirmed)
