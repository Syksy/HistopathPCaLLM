Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample origin, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the report, the samples are referred to as "näyte" which is Finnish for sample. The descriptions mention multiple cores with lengths like 8+6mm, 10mm, etc. This structure sounds more like biopsy cores rather than surgical specimens from RP or TURP. TURP usually involves chippings from the procedure, but the mention of multiple cores in lengths makes me think biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which translates to "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is diagnosed in the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to report the major + minor = sum as integers. The report mentions Gleason 4 in two samples. In sample (1), Gleason 4 is 20% and 3 is 30%. Since Gleason grading takes the two most predominant patterns. The major (primary) pattern is the higher grade, so here it's 4, and the minor (secondary) is 3. So 4 + 3 = 7. In sample (2), Gleason 4 is 15% and 3 is 35%. Wait, here the higher percentage is 35% for 3, but the grade is 4. Wait, no, the grade is determined by the pattern, not the percentage. So even if 3 is more in quantity, the presence of any higher grade (Gleason 4) would make the primary pattern 4. Wait, but the Gleason score is based on the most common (major) and the next most common (minor), but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might still be considered. Wait, I need to recall the Gleason scoring rules. The primary grade is the most predominant pattern, and the secondary is the next most predominant. If there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is considered if it's a significant component. However, in cases where a higher grade is present but not the most common, does it still count as primary? For example, if a tumor has 30% pattern 3 and 20% pattern 4, the primary would be 3, secondary 4, leading to 3+4=7. But if the highest grade is present in any quantity, but not the most, then it's still secondary. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive pattern. So in sample (1), the primary is 4 (since it's mentioned as Gleason 4 with 20% and 3 with 30%?), wait, wait the text says "Gleason 4 -kasvutapaa 20% ja 3-osuus n. 30%." So the 3 portion is 30%, which is higher than the 4's 20%. So primary would be 3, secondary 4, leading to 3+4=7. But the user instruction says to take the worst lesion. So which sample is the worst? Let's check both samples. Sample (1) has 4mm of tumor with Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%). Sample (2) has 5mm with Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (35%). Wait, but in sample (1), the majority is pattern 3 (30%) and pattern 4 is 20%, so the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. In sample (2), pattern 3 is 35% and pattern 4 is 15%, so again 3+4=7. But the user wants the pahimman leesion, the worst lesion. Both samples have the same Gleason score. However, maybe the highest grade present is considered. But in both cases, the score is 3+4=7. So the sum is 7. But wait, the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset", so the worst Gleason in any of the samples. If both are 3+4=7, then the sum is 7. But I need to check if there's any higher grade. The text doesn't mention Gleason 5, so the highest is 4. So the worst lesion in either sample is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7" or "3+4=7"? Wait, the primary is the most common, so in sample (1), primary is 3 (30%) and secondary 4 (20%), so 3+4=7. In sample (2), primary is 3 (35%) and secondary 4 (15%), so 3+4=7. So the correct sum is 7, but the major and minor are 3 and 4. However, the user's instruction says "major+minor=sum" in the format. So the answer should be "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? Wait, Gleason scoring is always written as primary (major) + secondary (minor) = sum. So if the primary is 3 and secondary 4, it's 3+4=7. If the primary is 4 and secondary 3, it's 4+3=7. Which is the case here? In sample (1), the primary is 3 (30%) and secondary 4 (20%), so 3+4=7. In sample (2), same. So the worst lesion would be 3+4=7. But sometimes, in some grading systems, if there's any pattern 4, even if less than 5%, it's considered. But according to the current guidelines, the primary is the most extensive, and secondary is the next. So the correct sum here is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example might have different formatting. Let me check the instructions again. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers. So the format is "X+Y=Z" where X and Y are the major and minor grades, and Z is the sum. So in this case, the major is 3, minor 4, sum 7. So the correct entry is "3+4=7". However, sometimes in practice, if the higher grade is present, even if it's not the most common, but in this case, the most common is 3. So the answer is 3+4=7. But I need to confirm. The text says in sample (1): "Gleason 4 -kasvutapaa 20% ja 3-osuus n. 30%." So 30% is pattern 3, 20% pattern 4. So primary is 3, secondary 4. So 3+4=7. Similarly for sample (2). Therefore, the worst lesion in any sample is 3+4=7. So the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".
