Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me start by understanding each requirement.

First, the sample type needs to be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "näyte" which translates to "sample" in Finnish. The samples are numbered (1), (2), and (3). The descriptions talk about "kudoslieriötä" (tissue cylinders), which are typically from a biopsy. RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are procedures, but there's no mention of surgery here. So the original sample type is likely a biopsy.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which means adenocarcinoma was found in samples (1) and (2). Sample (3) had no abnormalities. Since at least one sample is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions specify the format "major+minor=sum". In sample (1), Gleason 4 is 20% and 3 is 30%. The major pattern is the higher one, so Gleason 4 is major (since 4 > 3), and minor is 3. Sum is 4+3=7. Sample (2) has Gleason 4 at 15% and 3 at 35%. Here, the major would still be 4 (as it's the higher grade) even if the percentage is lower than 3. Wait, no—Gleason grading is based on the most common and second most common patterns, regardless of their exact percentages. The primary (major) is the most extensive, and the secondary (minor) is the next. But in sample (1), it's 20% Gleason 4 and 30% Gleason 3. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the primary pattern is the one with the highest grade, not the highest percentage. Wait, no, the primary is the most common (highest percentage), and the secondary is the next most common, but if there's a higher grade present, even if less in amount, it might still be considered. Wait, I need to recall Gleason scoring rules. The Gleason score is determined by the sum of the most prevalent pattern (primary) and the second most prevalent (secondary). However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might be considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next. But in some cases, if a higher grade is present in a minor component, it's still the secondary. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the text again.

In sample (1): "Gleason 4 -kasvutapaa 20% ja 3-osuus n. 30%." So 30% is Gleason 3 and 20% is Gleason 4. The rest (50%) is presumably benign or other. So the primary would be Gleason 3 (30%) and secondary Gleason 4 (20%), making the score 3+4=7. Wait, but the primary is the most extensive. If Gleason 3 is 30% and Gleason 4 is 20%, then primary is 3, secondary is 4. So sum is 3+4=7. But the user instructions say to take the pahimman leesion, which translates to "worst lesion". So perhaps they want the highest Gleason score found. Wait, the problem states: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – only the worst lesion's results should be returned. So among all samples, which one has the highest Gleason sum.

Sample (1): Gleason 3 (30%) and 4 (20%). So primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 7.

Sample (2): "Gleason 4 n. 15% ja 3-luokkaa vajaa 35%." So 35% is Gleason 3, 15% is Gleason 4. So primary is 3 (35%), secondary 4 (15%), sum 3+4=7.

So both samples (1) and (2) have Gleason 3+4=7. But wait, in sample (1), the primary is 3, secondary 4. In sample (2), primary is 3, secondary 4. So the highest sum is 7. But the user wants the worst lesion. If there's a higher grade in any sample, but in this case, both are 3+4=7. So the answer would be "4+3=7"? Wait, no. Wait, the primary is the higher grade if there's a higher grade present. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern. For example, if a tumor has 60% pattern 3 and 40% pattern 4, the score is 3+4=7. If another tumor has 40% pattern 4 and 30% pattern 3, then it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7, but the order matters. However, in the current case, sample (1) has 30% pattern 3 and 20% pattern 4. So primary is 3, secondary 4. Sum 3+4=7. Sample (2) has 35% pattern 3 and 15% pattern 4. So again primary 3, secondary 4. Sum 3+4=7. So the worst lesion in both is 3+4=7. But the user wants the pahimman leesion, which is the highest possible. If there's any sample with a higher sum, but here both are 7. So the answer is 3+4=7. But wait, the way the user wants it formatted is "major+minor=sum", where major is the higher grade. Wait, no. Wait, the major is the primary pattern (most extensive), and minor is the secondary. But if the secondary is a higher grade than the primary, does that affect the sum? No, the sum is primary + secondary. For example, if primary is 3 (most common) and secondary is 4, sum is 3+4=7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, sum is 4+3=7. But in terms of prognosis, 4+3 is worse than 3+4. However, the user's instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" where major and minor are integers. So perhaps the major is the higher of the two, but I need to check the exact instructions. The user says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the format is "major+minor=sum", where major and minor are integers. But how to determine major and minor? In Gleason scoring, the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns are added. So if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, it's 3+4=7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7, but the order matters. However, the user's instruction says "major+minor=sum". So perhaps "major" is the higher grade, and "minor" the lower. Wait, no. For example, if the primary is 4 and secondary is 3, the sum is 4+3=7. If primary is 3 and secondary is 4, sum is 3+4=7. But in the current case, both samples have primary 3 and secondary 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example might expect the higher grade to be listed first. Wait, no, the primary is listed first. So in the samples, the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7". But I need to check the text again. The text for sample (1) says "Gleason 4 -kasvutapaa 20% ja 3-osuus n. 30%." So the 3-osuus (3 portion) is 30%, and Gleason 4 is 20%. So the primary is 3, secondary 4. So sum 3+4=7. Similarly for sample (2): "erilaistuminen Gleason 4 n. 15% ja 3-luokkaa vajaa 35%." So 35% is 3, 15% is 4. Primary 3, secondary 4. Sum 3+4=7. Therefore, the worst lesion in both is 3+4=7. So the answer for Gleason is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: biopsy (since the samples are referred to as "näyte" and described as tissue cylinders, typical of biopsy).
2. Malignant findings: yes (adenocarcinoma found).
3. Gleason grade: "3+4=7".
