Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the report, the samples are referred to as "näyte" which is Finnish for sample. The descriptions mention "kaksi kudoslieriötä" (two tissue cores) and "yksi 10mm" (one 10mm). These terms are typical for biopsy samples, as biopsies often involve multiple cores. RP and TURP are procedures that remove more tissue, so the mention of multiple cores suggests biopsy. So the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which translates to "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is diagnosed in the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions Gleason 4 in samples 1 and 2. The user wants the worst (pahin) lesion's result. In sample 1, Gleason 4 is 20% and 3 is 30%. In sample 2, Gleason 4 is 15% and 3 is under 35%. Gleason grading takes the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. The highest Gleason in each sample is 4, so the major is 4. The minor would be the next most prevalent. For sample 1, the major is 4 (20%) and minor is 3 (30%). For sample 2, major is 4 (15%) and minor is 3 (35%). The worst would be the highest sum. Both are 4+3=7. However, the user wants the worst lesion's sum. Since both samples 1 and 2 have Gleason 4, the sum is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). The primary pattern is the higher grade, so if in a lesion the primary is 4 and secondary is 3, the sum is 7. Both samples 1 and 2 have 4+3=7. So the worst is 7. But the user might expect the highest possible, but in this case, both are 7. So the answer is "4+3=7".

Sample 3 has no malignancy, but since samples 1 and 2 are malignant, the overall answer is "kyllä" for malignancy. The Gleason is based on the worst lesion, which is 4+3=7.
