Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Original sample type**: The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" (1), (2), and (3). The report mentions "prostatan adenokarsinooma" (prostate adenocarcinoma) but doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The samples are described with dimensions (0.5mm, etc.), which might suggest biopsy cores, but it's not explicitly stated. Since there's no clear mention of the procedure type, I should go with "NA".

2. **Malignant findings**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The conclusion states that the presence of adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or ruled out. The initial suspicion of PIN changes was later retracted as unreliable. So, there's no confirmed malignancy. However, the report mentions that in sample (1), they tried to evaluate Gleason patterns but had differing opinions. Since Gleason grading is for malignancies, but the conclusion is uncertain, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed. But wait, the presence of Gleason evaluation might imply some suspicion. However, the final conclusion says it can't be confirmed, so the answer should be "ei" or "NA"? The user instructions say to report only the worst lesion. Since the conclusion is that it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". But the report says "ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota" (can't reliably confirm or deny), so perhaps "NA" is safer. Hmm, but the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. If there's no definitive malignant findings, then "ei". But the uncertainty might lead to NA. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). Since the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or denied, and the initial suspicion was retracted, the answer is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. But maybe the presence of Gleason evaluation suggests some malignancy? However, the Gleason assessment was attempted but inconclusive due to differing opinions. So, the answer is "ei" because the final conclusion is that malignancy isn't confirmed. So, "ei".

3. **Gleason grade**: The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even though they tried to assess it, the result wasn't conclusive, and the case was to be reviewed. So, no valid Gleason score is provided here. Therefore, "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no confirmed malignancy)
3. Gleason grade: NA (since no malignancy confirmed)
