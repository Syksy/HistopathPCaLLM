Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" (1), (2), and (3). The report mentions "prostatan adenokarsinooma -löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota," which translates to the adenocarcinoma couldn't be confirmed or ruled out. However, the sample types aren't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "PIN-muutoksia" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) but that's a finding, not the sample type. Since there's no clear indication of the sample procedure, the answer here should be NA.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The report states that in sample (1), there were "monitahoisia solunäytemuotoja" (complex glandular patterns) evaluated for Gleason patterns, but due to discrepancies, it was to be reviewed. However, the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma couldn't be confirmed or ruled out. Samples (2) and (3) either had material where differentiation couldn't be assessed or were non-representative. The key point is that malignancy isn't definitively confirmed. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but also doesn't rule it out definitively, the safest answer here is "ei" because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. The text says that the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or denied. So the samples might have some suspicious features but not enough for a definitive diagnosis. In such cases, since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer should be "ei". But I need to be careful. The samples (1) and (2) initially thought to have PIN changes, which are pre-malignant, but that was later retracted. So there's no confirmed malignancy. Hence, "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The report mentions that in sample (1), almost all could be assessed for Gleason differentiation patterns, but there were discrepancies leading to a need for further review. However, since the malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason score wouldn't be reported. The allowed value is "major+minor=sum" for confirmed malignancies, otherwise NA. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason grade should be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
