Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as (1), (2), and (3). The report mentions "prostatan adenokarsinooma -löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota," which translates to the adenocarcinoma finding can't be confirmed or ruled out. However, the sample types aren't explicitly stated. The text mentions "näyte (1)" etc., but without terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that the presence of adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or denied. Initially, samples (1) and (2) were thought to have PIN changes, but that was later retracted. Since the conclusion is that malignancy can't be confirmed or ruled out, but there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, the answer here would be "ei" (no), because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. However, I need to be careful here. The key phrase is "ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota" – so it's uncertain. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the initial suspicion (PIN) was retracted, and the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma isn't confirmed, the answer might be "ei". But wait, the samples (1) had Gleason patterns assessed, which is typically for cancer. However, the conclusion is that it can't be confirmed. So maybe the presence of malignancy is uncertain, but according to the allowed values, it's either yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". The text mentions that in sample (1), almost all could be assessed for Gleason differentiation patterns, but due to differing opinions, it's to be evaluated in a uro meeting. However, since the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed, the malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, Gleason grade would be "NA" because the findings aren't confirmed as malignant. Even though they tried to assess Gleason, the final result isn't a confirmed cancer, so Gleason isn't applicable here.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The samples (1) had Gleason assessment, but since the case is going for further review and the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma isn't confirmed, the malignancy is "ei". So the structured data would be as above.
