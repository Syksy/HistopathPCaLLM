Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate." RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant tumors. The report states "Histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text says the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4. The largest tumor focus has these as major and minor components. The format should be major+minor=sum. So 3+4=7.

Need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The largest tumor focus is on the basis side with Gleason 3 and 4, which sums to 7. That's the highest mentioned, so that's the one to report.

No nested structures in the JSON. All values are correctly mapped. Let me double-check allowed values: sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All valid.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
