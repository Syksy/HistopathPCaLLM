Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the material is from the prostate, processed with usual procedures. The samples are marked A-C for apex and D-F for basis. There's no mention of how the sample was obtained, like a biopsy procedure, surgery (RP), or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that the material is difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy. However, clinical notes mention a possible 'Gleason sum 7', which is associated with malignancy. Even though there's uncertainty, the mention of Gleason score suggests there was a malignant finding. So the answer here is yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The clinical notes mention 'Gleason sum 7' but clarify that it's unclear if it's GG 2 or 3 and if the sum was verified. Since there's uncertainty, but the sum 7 is mentioned, we should report it as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". However, the exact major and minor aren't specified. But the user allows "NA" only for benign cases, which this isn't. The instruction says to report the Gleason grade as major+minor=sum if possible. Since the sum is 7 but the components aren't clear, maybe we should put "NA" here. Wait, no. The allowed values for malignant cases should be in the format of numbers. But the problem is that the components (3+4 vs 4+3) aren't specified. The user says "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum, but if it's unclear, maybe we can just put "7" or "NA". However, the example given in the instructions shows "major+minor=sum" as the format. Since the sum is 7 but the exact breakdown isn't confirmed, perhaps the answer should be "NA" because the components aren't verified. But the user says "reported Gleason grade" and the clinical notes mention 'Gleason sum 7', even if it's unclear. So maybe the answer is "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's not specified, perhaps we should put "NA". Alternatively, the sum is 7, so maybe "7" is acceptable, but the preferred format is with major and minor. Since the exact grades aren't clear, the safest answer is "NA" here. Wait, the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign". Since the statement is malignant (as per question 2 being yes), but the Gleason components are unclear, maybe we should put "NA" because the exact grades aren't confirmed. But the sum is mentioned as 7. Hmm. The instruction says "reported Gleason grade" and the clinical notes mention 'Gleason sum 7', even if it's unclear. So perhaps the answer is "7", but the preferred format is major+minor. Since the components aren't specified, maybe the answer is "NA". Alternatively, the user might expect "7" as the sum is reported, even if the breakdown isn't. But the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So maybe "NA" is better here because the exact breakdown isn't verified. The report says it's unclear if it's GG 2 or 3 (which refers to Grade Groups, not Gleason scores directly). Wait, Grade Group 2 is Gleason 3+4=7, and Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. So the sum is 7, but the components are uncertain. The user wants the Gleason grade in the format "major+minor=sum". Since the sum is 7 but the major and minor aren't confirmed, perhaps the answer is "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's unclear, maybe "NA" is appropriate. However, the user's instruction says "reported Gleason grade" and the sum is mentioned, even if uncertain. So perhaps the answer should be "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's not specified, maybe "7" is acceptable. But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Since the exact breakdown isn't clear, the correct answer here is "NA" because the components aren't verified. Alternatively, the user might accept "7" as the sum is reported. But according to the instructions, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". Since that's not possible here, "NA" is the answer. Wait, but the user says "for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign". Since this is a malignant case (question 2 is yes), but the Gleason components are unclear, maybe "NA" is still acceptable. So the answer for Gleason grade is "NA".
