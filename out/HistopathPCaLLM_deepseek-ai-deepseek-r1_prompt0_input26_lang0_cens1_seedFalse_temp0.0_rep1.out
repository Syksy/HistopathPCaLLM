Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions "The studied material originates from the prostate, and is processed according to the usual processing procedures and markings." It also refers to samples marked with indices A-C for apex and D-F for basis. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The terms "samples" are generic, so without specific procedure names, I might have to default to NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions clinical notes about 'Gleason sum 7', which is a grading system for prostate cancer, indicating malignancy. However, the report also states that the material is difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy (RT). The presence of a Gleason score suggests malignancy, but the uncertainty in the report might affect this. The key point is whether there's a confirmed malignant finding. The report doesn't explicitly state the presence of a tumor but refers to a possible Gleason sum. Since the Gleason score is associated with cancer, but the report is uncertain, maybe the answer is yes because the possibility is mentioned, even if uncertain. Alternatively, if the uncertainty is too high, it might be NA. But the instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. Since the clinical notes mention a possible Gleason 7, which is a malignant indicator, even if uncertain, the answer here is likely "yes".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says "possible 'Gleason sum 7'; however, it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3". The sum is 7, but the individual grades (like 3+4 or 4+3) aren't specified. The user allows "NA" for benign, but here it's malignant. However, since the exact major and minor aren't clear, but the sum is mentioned as 7, maybe we can report "3+4=7" or "4+3=7" but the report says it's unclear. The instruction says to use "NA" for benign, but here it's malignant. Since the sum is mentioned but the exact grades aren't verified, perhaps the answer should be "NA" because the individual grades aren't confirmed. Alternatively, if the sum is considered sufficient, maybe "7" but the format requires major+minor=sum. Since the exact breakdown isn't clear, the safest answer is "NA" here.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant is yes, Gleason grade is NA.
