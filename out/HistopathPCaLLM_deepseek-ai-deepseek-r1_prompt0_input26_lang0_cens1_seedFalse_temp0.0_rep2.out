Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the material is from the prostate, processed with usual procedures. The samples are marked A-C for apex and D-F for basis. There's no mention of how the sample was obtained, like a biopsy procedure, surgery (RP), or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that the material is difficult to assess due to recent radiation therapy. However, clinical notes mention a possible 'Gleason sum 7', which is associated with malignancy. Even though there's uncertainty, the mention of Gleason score implies malignancy. So the answer here is yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text states a possible Gleason sum 7 but clarifies it's unclear if it's GG 2 or 3 and if verified. Since there's ambiguity, but the sum 7 is mentioned, we should report it as 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. However, the exact major and minor aren't specified. But the user allows "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. Since the sum is 7, but the components are unclear, maybe the safest way is to put "3+4=7" as a common combination, but the text doesn't confirm. Alternatively, since it's unclear, maybe NA? Wait, the instructions say for malignant statements, report the Gleason grade. The clinical notes mention 'possible' Gleason sum 7, but it's not verified. The report says due to RT, histopathology can't assess treatment trajectory. So maybe the Gleason isn't confirmed. The user's allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the tumor is malignant (yes), but the Gleason is uncertain, should we still report 7? The problem is the exact components aren't clear, but the sum is mentioned. The user might want the sum even if uncertain. But the example in the problem statement says "if the 7 sum was indeed verified" is unclear. So maybe the answer here is "NA" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, the presence of "possible" might mean we should note it as 7 but with components unknown. However, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Since the components are unclear, perhaps the answer is NA. But the user might expect to capture the possible sum. Hmm. The instructions say "reported Gleason grade" so if it's mentioned, even if uncertain, maybe we should put "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". But the text doesn't specify which. Since the user allows "preferably" the major+minor=sum, but if not possible, maybe just the sum. Wait, the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So if the sum is 7 but components unknown, perhaps the answer is "NA" because the exact major and minor aren't given. Alternatively, maybe the user expects the sum even if components are unclear. But the example in the problem statement's note says "possible 'Gleason sum 7'; however, it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3..." Wait, GG 2 or 3 refers to Grade Groups, not the actual Gleason scores. Grade Group 2 is Gleason 3+4=7, and Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. So the sum is 7, but the components are either 3+4 or 4+3, making it Grade Group 2 or 3. But the Gleason grade itself is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The report mentions the sum is 7, but the components are unclear. So the Gleason sum is 7, but the exact breakdown isn't known. The user wants the Gleason grade in "major+minor=sum" format. Since the sum is 7 but the components are uncertain, perhaps the answer is "NA" because the exact major and minor aren't reported. However, the sum is mentioned as possible. The instructions say "reported Gleason grade" so if the sum is reported, even if uncertain, maybe we should put "7" but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Since the components aren't specified, maybe the answer is "NA". Alternatively, the user might accept "7" as the sum, but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, since the components aren't clear, the answer is "NA".
