Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, so the sample type here is likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states there's a "laaja kasvain" (extensive tumor) and mentions "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive margins). Also, Gleason grades are discussed, which are related to cancer. So the malignancy is present. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So the second answer is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the report says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". The primary pattern is 3, and the secondary is 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7". Since there's malignancy, we don't use NA here.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. The sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is correctly calculated. All values fit the allowed options. No issues here.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
