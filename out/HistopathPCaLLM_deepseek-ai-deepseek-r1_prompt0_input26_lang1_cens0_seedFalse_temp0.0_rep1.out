Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". In Finnish, "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. The options given are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Since "prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to the prostatectomy specimen, the correct type here should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "laaja kasvain", which means a widespread tumor. Additionally, it mentions "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive margins) and discusses Gleason grades, which are indicators of malignancy. So, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". The primary pattern is 3, and the secondary is 4, with almost as much of grade 4. The sum would be 3 + 4 = 7. The format required is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion's results are included. The sample type is RP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 3+4=7. No other lesions are mentioned that are worse than this.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
