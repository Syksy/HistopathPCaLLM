Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". In Finnish, "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy. The options allowed are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Since "prostatektomia" is a prostatectomy, which is typically a radical procedure, the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "laaja kasvain" (extensive tumor) and mentions "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive margins), which are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". This translates to predominant Gleason grade 3, and grade 4 differentiation almost as much. The major pattern is 3, minor is 4. Summing them gives 3+4=7. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered. The largest tumor focus is in the base with Gleason 3 and 4, so that's the primary and secondary patterns. No higher grades are mentioned. Also, since there's malignancy, Gleason isn't "NA".

Double-checking each field against the allowed values. Sample type "RP" is valid. Malignancy is "kyllä". Gleason is correctly formatted. No nested structures in the JSON, just flat keys. All seems good.

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
