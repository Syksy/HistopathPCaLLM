Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: the sample's original type, presence of malignancy, and the reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as being from the prostate, processed normally, and labeled with indices A-C (apex) and D-F (near the base). There's no mention of surgery type like RP or TURP, and it's not explicitly a biopsy. However, sometimes in clinical contexts, if they're taking multiple samples from different regions (like apex and base), it might be a biopsy. But the text doesn't specify the procedure type clearly. The term "näytteet" (samples) is used, but without context like TURP or RP. So maybe the original type isn't specified here, hence NA.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed for treatment trajectory. However, the clinical notes mention a possible 'Gleason sum 7', which is a score for cancer. But it's unclear if it's GG2 or 3 and if the sum was confirmed. Even though there's uncertainty, the presence of a Gleason score suggests malignancy. So the answer here would be "kyllä" (yes), despite the uncertainty in grading.

Third, the Gleason grade. The report mentions 'Gleason summa 7', but it's unclear if it's grade group 2 (3+4) or 3 (4+3), and whether the sum was confirmed. However, the user instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. Since the sum is 7, even if the major and minor components aren't specified, we can note it as "7". But the problem is that the exact major and minor aren't given. Wait, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't specified, can we still report the sum? The example given in the allowed values is "major+minor=sum" as integers, but if only the sum is known, maybe we have to put "NA"? But the text does mention "summa 7", which is the total. However, the user might expect the sum even if the individual components aren't clear. But the instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (reported Gleason grade). Since it's reported as sum 7, even if the components are unclear, perhaps we should put "7". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". If the major and minor aren't specified, can we infer? For example, sum 7 could be 3+4 or 4+3, but since it's unclear, maybe we can't specify. But the user's allowed values include "major+minor=sum" as integers. If the report only states the sum, maybe we can't fill in the major and minor, so the answer would be "NA"? Wait, but the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". The presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so we need to provide the Gleason. But if the sum is given as 7, even if the components are unclear, maybe we should report "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? But the text says it's unclear whether it's GG2 or 3, which correspond to 3+4=7 (GG2) and 4+3=7 (GG3). Since it's unclear, but the sum is 7, perhaps the correct approach is to report "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? But the user might want just the sum. Wait, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" as integers. So if the sum is 7 but the components aren't clear, maybe we can't report the major and minor, so the answer would be "NA"? But the user's instruction says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (what was the reported Gleason grade). The report does mention 'Gleason summa 7', so the sum is reported. However, the required format is major+minor=sum. If the components aren't specified, perhaps we can't fill that in. But maybe the user expects the sum even if the components aren't clear. For example, if the sum is 7, but major and minor are unknown, maybe we can write "NA" because the format requires major and minor. Alternatively, maybe the system should still report the sum as "7" in the format. But the allowed values are in "major+minor=sum" format. So if the sum is known but the components aren't, perhaps the answer is "NA". But the example might have cases where only the sum is given. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So for malignant cases, the value should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the sum is reported but not the components, can we still put "NA"? Or is the sum enough? For example, if the report says "Gleason score 7", but doesn't break it into 3+4 or 4+3, then the major and minor aren't known. In that case, according to the user's instructions, the answer would be "NA" because the required format isn't met. But the user might want the sum even if components are missing. However, the allowed values strictly require "major+minor=sum". Therefore, if the components aren't specified, even if the sum is known, the answer should be "NA". But in the given text, the sum is mentioned as 7, but it's unclear if it's 3+4 or 4+3. So the components are not confirmed, hence the answer is "NA". Wait, but the user's instruction says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the sum is reported, even without components, maybe the answer should be "7=7" or something, but that's not the format. The format requires major and minor. Therefore, since the components are unclear, the answer is "NA". 

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says samples from apex and base. So NA.

2. Malignant findings: Yes, because Gleason sum 7 is mentioned, indicating cancer.

3. Gleason grade: NA, because the components (major and minor) are unclear, even though the sum is 7.
