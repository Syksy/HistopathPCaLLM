Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as being from the prostate apex and base areas, with indices A-C and D-F. The terms used are "näytteet" (samples) and mentions of apex and basiksesta (base). There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so this is likely a biopsy. So the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says there's a mention of 'Gleason summa 7', which indicates cancer. However, it's unclear if it's GG2 or 3, but the presence of a Gleason score usually means malignancy. Even though the histopathology is difficult due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the fact that a Gleason sum is mentioned suggests there were malignant findings. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions 'Gleason summa 7', but it's unclear if it's GG2 (3+4) or GG3 (4+3). However, the user instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the sum is 7, but the major and minor aren't specified, should we put "NA"? Wait, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" as integers. But the text says the sum is 7, but the components (3+4 vs 4+3) are unclear. However, the user wants the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. The problem is that the exact components aren't confirmed. But the instruction says to report the sum even if the components are unclear. Wait, the example given in the allowed values is "major+minor=sum", so maybe we need to put "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's unclear, perhaps we should just put "7" as the sum. But the allowed format requires "major+minor=sum". However, the text says it's unclear whether it's GG2 or 3, which correspond to 3+4=7 (GG2) or 4+3=7 (GG3). Since the exact components aren't confirmed, maybe we can't specify the major and minor. But the user instructions say to report the Gleason in that format. Hmm. The problem is that the report mentions the sum as 7 but the components are unclear. The user's instruction says to report the sum as "major+minor=sum". If the components are unknown, perhaps we can't fill that part. But the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers. Wait, maybe the correct approach is to put "NA" here? But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so Gleason should be reported. However, the exact components are unclear. The user might expect "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's not specified, perhaps the sum is 7, but the major and minor aren't known. But the problem is that the allowed format requires the sum to be in "major+minor=sum" form. If the components are unknown, maybe we can't report it, but the sum is given as 7. The user might accept "NA" here, but the text does mention "Gleason summa 7". Wait, the instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa...)". So if the sum is reported as 7, even if the components are unclear, the reported sum is 7. But the format requires major and minor. Since the report mentions the sum as 7 but the components are unclear, perhaps we can't determine the major and minor, so we can't format it as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Therefore, even though the sum is 7, the exact components are not confirmed, so maybe the answer should be "NA". But that contradicts the fact that the sum is mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to report "7" as the sum, but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Since the user's example in the instructions probably expects something like "3+4=7", but here it's unclear, perhaps the answer is "NA". Wait, the user's instructions for the third field say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)". Since the malignancy is "kyllä", the Gleason should be in the "major+minor=sum" format. But if the components are unknown, but the sum is reported, how to handle it? The text says "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'", which is a possible sum of 7, but it's unclear if confirmed. However, the user wants the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So even if it's possible, if it's the worst reported, maybe we take that. But the components are unclear. In this case, since the sum is mentioned but the components are not, perhaps the answer is "NA" for the Gleason. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 7, but since the components are unknown, we can't format it as "X+Y=7", so the answer is "NA". But the user might expect "7" in some way. However, the allowed format is strict: "major+minor=sum". If the components are not specified, we can't create that string. Therefore, even though the sum is 7, since the major and minor aren't known, the answer is "NA". 

Wait, but the example in the instructions says "major+minor=sum" as integers. So if the sum is 7 but the components are unknown, the correct answer would be "NA" because the exact major and minor aren't reported. Therefore, in this case, even though the sum is mentioned as 7, since the components (3+4 vs 4+3) are unclear, the Gleason grade can't be structured into the required format, hence "NA".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy (since it's samples from apex and base, likely biopsy)
2. Malignancy: kyllä (because Gleason sum 7 is mentioned, indicating cancer)
3. Gleason: NA (because the components aren't confirmed, even though the sum is 7)
