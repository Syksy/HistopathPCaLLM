Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight cassettes." The term "shavings" often refers to TURP specimens, which are obtained by shaving off tissue from the prostate. So, the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report states "Carcinoma was histologically detected...", which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So that's straightforward: "3+3=6".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report only mentions one Gleason score (3+3=6) in blocks F & G, there's no need to compare multiple lesions. All the information comes from the same lesion, so that's the one to report.

Now, structuring this into JSON without nested structures. Each field should be a top-level key. The values must be exactly as specified: sample type as "TURP", malignant as "yes", Gleason as "3+3=6". No nested objects or arrays here.

Double-checking the allowed values for each field. Sample type: TURP is valid. Malignant: yes is correct. Gleason: the format matches "major+minor=sum" with numbers. All set. No NA needed here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}
```
