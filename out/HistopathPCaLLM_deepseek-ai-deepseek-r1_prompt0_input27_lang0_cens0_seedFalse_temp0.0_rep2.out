Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight cassettes." The term "shavings" often refers to TURP specimens, which are obtained by shaving off prostate tissue during the procedure. So, the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report states, "Carcinoma was histologically detected..." Since carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum", which in this case is exactly provided as 3+3=6. So, the value should be "3+3=6".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's only one carcinoma mentioned with Gleason 6, that's the one to report. No nested structures in the JSON, just straightforward key-value pairs. All fields are covered, and no "NA" is needed here because all information is present. Let me double-check the sample type again. TURP makes sense with shavings. Biopsy would typically be cores, RP is the whole prostate. Yep, TURP is correct. Malignant is yes, Gleason is 3+3=6. Looks good.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}
