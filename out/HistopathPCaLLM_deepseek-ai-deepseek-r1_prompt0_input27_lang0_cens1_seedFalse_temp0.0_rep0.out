Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." The terms "source prostate tissue" and "run in eight batches" don't clearly indicate the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "the growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation, although debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." The key points here are "did not follow normal differentiation" and "Gleason score 3." Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is a low-grade cancer. However, the wording is a bit uncertain: "debatably" and "maybe." But since Gleason score is mentioned, even if it's tentative, it suggests the presence of malignant findings. So, the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum." The statement mentions "Gleason score 3," but it's unclear if that's the sum or a single grade. In Gleason scoring, the sum is the combination of the two most prevalent grades. If only a single grade is mentioned, sometimes it's considered as both major and minor being the same. However, the statement says "Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen," which typically refers to the sum. But in reality, Gleason scores range from 6 to 10, with 3+3=6, 3+4=7, etc. Wait, that's a point of confusion. The current grading system groups Gleason scores into grade groups, and the actual score is a sum of two numbers (each from 1 to 5). So a Gleason score of 3 would actually be 1+2=3, but that's not used anymore. Modern grading starts at 3+3=6. So maybe the mention of Gleason score 3 here is a mistake or outdated terminology. However, the user wants the reported Gleason grade as per the text. The text says "Gleason score 3," so even though it's not standard, we have to take it as reported. But since the sum is 3, which is not possible in current practice, maybe the user expects "NA" here. Alternatively, perhaps the text meant a pattern of 3, not the sum. If the statement is referring to a Gleason pattern 3 (as part of the score), then the sum would be 3+3=6, but the text says "score 3." This is conflicting. Given the uncertainty in the text ("debatably" and "maybe"), and the fact that the score is mentioned as 3, which is not a valid sum, perhaps the answer should be "NA" because it's unclear or not a valid entry. Alternatively, if we take it as a typo and assume they meant 3+3=6, but the text doesn't specify that. Since the user wants exactly what's reported, and the reported is "Gleason score 3," which isn't a valid sum, maybe the answer is "NA." But the user instructions say to put "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. If the text says "Gleason score 3," but that's not a valid sum, perhaps the answer is "NA." Alternatively, if the user expects to take the number as the sum even if it's incorrect, then "3". But I think the correct approach here is to note that the Gleason score is invalid, so "NA". However, the presence of "Gleason score 3" in the text might mean that the sum is 3, which is not possible, so maybe the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if the user allows for such entries, but the allowed values are "major+minor=sum", then perhaps "3" but that's not in the format. Wait, the allowed values for Gleason grade are preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So if the sum is 3, then it's "3", but that's not a valid Gleason sum. The minimum sum is 6 (3+3). So this is conflicting. The text might have an error, but the user wants the reported value. So perhaps the answer is "3" as the sum, even though it's not valid. But the user might expect "NA" in such cases. Alternatively, maybe the "Gleason score 3" refers to the pattern, not the sum. If the major and minor are both 3, then the sum is 6. But the text says "score 3", which is confusing. Given the ambiguity and the user's instruction to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum", and the text mentioning "Gleason score 3", which is not a valid sum, the safest answer is "NA" because it's unclear or invalid. However, the user might want to take the number as is. Hmm. This is a tricky part. Since the user says "reported Gleason grade", even if it's incorrect, we should report it as per the text. But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". If the text says "Gleason score 3", perhaps the sum is 3, which would be in the format "3", but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the text meant Gleason pattern 3, but the sum would be 3+3=6. But the text says "score", which refers to the sum. So if the score is 3, that's invalid. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the reported score is invalid. Alternatively, the answer is "3" as the sum. But given that the user expects "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers, and the text says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum, even if invalid, perhaps the answer is "3". But I need to check if the user allows that. The allowed values are preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. So "3" is a whole number, but it's not a valid Gleason sum. However, the user might just want whatever is reported. So in this case, the answer would be "3". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the statement is uncertain ("debatably", "maybe") and the score is invalid. The user instructions say to return the results from the most severe lesion. The statement mentions "the rest of the samples did not follow normal differentiation" and "Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities". So the most severe lesion here is the one with Gleason score 3. Even though it's tentative, we have to report it. But the validity of the score is an issue. Since the user's allowed values for Gleason grade are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers, and the text says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum, even if invalid, the answer should be "3". But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the score is invalid. But the user might prefer capturing exactly what's written. So I'll go with "3" as the sum, even though it's not a valid score in real practice. But wait, the current Gleason grading system starts at 3+3=6. So a score of 3 is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer here is "NA" because the reported score is invalid. The system might not recognize it, so it's better to mark it as NA. Alternatively, the user might want to take it as is. This is a bit of a dilemma. Given that the user's instruction is to report the Gleason grade as per the text, and the text says "Gleason score 3", even if it's invalid, the answer should be "3". But in reality, that's incorrect. However, since the task is to structure the data as reported, not to validate it, perhaps "3" is the answer. But I need to check the user's examples. Wait, the user didn't provide examples, but the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So "3" would be a sum, but in reality, the sum is at least 6. But the text says "score 3", so maybe the answer is "3". Alternatively, if the user expects the sum to be in the format like "3+3=6", but the text says "3", then it's unclear. But the user's instruction says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers". Wait, maybe the user wants the sum as a whole number. So if the text says "Gleason score 3", the sum is 3, so the answer is "3". Even though it's invalid, the task is to extract what's reported. Therefore, the answer for Gleason grade is "3". But I'm still conflicted. Alternatively, maybe the text meant Gleason pattern 3, not the score. If that's the case, then the sum would be 3+3=6. But the text says "score", which refers to the sum. So if the score is 3, that's invalid, but the answer is "3". So I think the correct structured data here is:

1. Original sample type: NA (not mentioned)
2. Malignant tumor findings: yes (since Gleason score is mentioned, even if tentative)
3. Gleason grade: 3 (as reported, even if invalid)

But I need to confirm. The user says "the reported Gleason grade" and "allowed values preferably 'major+minor=sum'". If the text says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum, then the answer is "3". Even if it's invalid, the task is to extract it. So I'll proceed with that.
