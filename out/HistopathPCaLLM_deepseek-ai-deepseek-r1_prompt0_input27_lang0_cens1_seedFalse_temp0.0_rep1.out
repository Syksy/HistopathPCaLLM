Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." The terms "source prostate tissue" and "run in eight batches" don't clearly indicate the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "the growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation, although debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." The key points here are "did not follow normal differentiation" and "Gleason score 3." Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is a low-grade cancer. However, the wording is a bit uncertain: "debatably" and "maybe be seen in small quantities." But since Gleason score is mentioned, even if it's uncertain, it suggests the presence of malignant cells. So, the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum." The statement mentions "Gleason score 3," but it's unclear if that's the sum or a single component. Typically, Gleason scores are a sum of the two most prevalent grades. However, the text says "Gleason score 3," which might be the sum. If it's the sum, then the major and minor would both be 3, but that's not possible because the sum is 3, which would require grades like 1+2=3 or 2+1=3. But the statement just says "Gleason score 3," so maybe the major and minor are both 1 and 2 or 2 and 1. However, in practice, Gleason scores below 6 are rarely reported now. But according to the text, it's stated as score 3. Since the user wants the format "major+minor=sum," and the sum here is 3, but the exact grades aren't specified. However, the text is uncertain: "debatably" and "maybe." So, should we report it as 3? But the user wants "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. Since the statement only mentions the sum as 3, but doesn't specify the major and minor components, maybe we can't structure it properly. The allowed value is "NA" for benign, but here it's malignant. Wait, the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'... or 'NA' for benign." Since the malignant finding is "yes," but the Gleason is uncertain, maybe we should put "3" as the sum. But the correct format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 3, then it's likely 1+2=3 or 2+1=3. But the text doesn't specify. However, the user might accept "3" as the sum. But the instruction says preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. So, if the sum is 3, but the individual grades aren't given, should we put "NA"? Or is the sum enough? The example in the problem statement might help. Wait, the user's example in the problem statement (not shown here) might have been "4+3=7" or similar. But given that the text here only mentions "Gleason score 3" without the components, perhaps we can't structure it as "major+minor=sum". Therefore, the answer here would be "NA" because the individual grades aren't specified, only the sum. But the user allows "NA" for benign, but this is a malignant case. Hmm. The instruction says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'... or 'NA' for benign statements." Since this is a malignant statement (we answered "yes" to malignant), but the Gleason components aren't provided, maybe we should still put "3" as the sum. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 3, but the components aren't given, perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, maybe the user expects "3+0=3" but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the components aren't specified. But the user says "preferably" in the format, so if the sum is given, even without components, maybe we can put "3" as the sum. But the format requires "major+minor=sum". For example, if the sum is 6, it's "3+3=6". If the sum is 3, but the components aren't given, perhaps we can't structure it. Therefore, the answer here is "NA" because the individual grades aren't specified, even though the sum is mentioned. But the user might expect to take the sum as given. The statement says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum. So maybe the answer is "3+0=3", but that's not a valid Gleason score. Wait, Gleason scores are typically two numbers added, each from 1 to 5, with the first being the most common and the second the next most common. So a sum of 3 would require, for example, 1+2=3 or 2+1=3. But the text doesn't specify. However, the user's instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. If the sum is given but not the components, perhaps we can't structure it. Therefore, the answer is "NA" for the Gleason grade. But the user might expect to put "3" as the sum. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". Since the components aren't provided, I think the answer should be "NA" even though it's a malignant case. But this is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "3" as the sum, but the format is incorrect. The user might prefer "NA" in this case. So, given the uncertainty in the components, the answer is "NA".
