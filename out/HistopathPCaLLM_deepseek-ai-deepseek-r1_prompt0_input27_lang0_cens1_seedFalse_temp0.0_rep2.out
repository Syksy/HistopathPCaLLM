Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." The terms here don't clearly indicate the sample type. Biopsy, RP, or TURP are specific procedures, but the text mentions "source prostate tissue" in a general way. There's no mention of how the sample was obtained, like a biopsy procedure, surgery (RP), or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation." Wait, "did not follow normal" might suggest something abnormal, but does that mean malignant? Also, it mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." Gleason score 3 is part of the grading system, but Gleason 3 is considered a lower grade. However, the presence of any Gleason score typically indicates malignancy. But the wording here is uncertain: "debatably" and "maybe" in small quantities. The main samples (F and G) have prostatic tissue, but the others have abnormal growth. However, the key point is whether there's a confirmed malignant tumor. Since it's debatable and only a maybe, maybe the answer is no? Or does the presence of any Gleason score, even if uncertain, count as yes? The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. If the Gleason is mentioned, even if uncertain, perhaps it's considered a yes. But the statement says "did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation" which might be benign or malignant. Hmm. Maybe the answer here is yes because Gleason score is mentioned, even if it's uncertain. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, if the main samples (F and G) are verified as prostatic tissue but the others have abnormal growth, but the Gleason 3 is debatable. If the Gleason is part of the tumor grading, then maybe it's a yes. But the uncertainty complicates things. The user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. If the most severe is Gleason 3 (which is part of the grading for cancer), then malignant would be yes. So I think the answer is yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." Wait, Gleason score is the sum of the two most common grades. If it's score 3, that would be 3+0=3 or 1+2=3, but typically Gleason 3 is 3+0. However, the mention here is "Gleason score 3", not the individual grades. The problem is that the structured field requires major and minor grades. But the text doesn't specify the primary and secondary patterns. So maybe we can't extract the major and minor, but the user allows "NA" for benign. However, in this case, if we considered malignant as yes, then the Gleason should be reported. But since the text only mentions the score as 3 without the breakdown, perhaps we can't determine the major and minor. But the allowed values prefer "major+minor=sum". If the score is 3, the most common is 3+0=3. But the user might expect that. However, the text says "debatably" and "maybe", so maybe it's not confirmed. The instructions say to report the Gleason grade for malignant statements. If we answered yes to malignant, then we need to report the Gleason. But if the Gleason is uncertain, should we still report it? The user says to take the most severe lesion. If the Gleason is mentioned, even if debatable, perhaps we should report it. But the problem is the format. The text says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum. So maybe the answer is 3+0=3. But the original data doesn't specify the primary and secondary grades, only the sum. The user instructions say "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". If the sum is given but not the breakdown, can we infer? For example, a Gleason score of 3 would typically be 3+0, but that's an assumption. However, in real practice, Gleason scores start at 6 (3+3) now, but that's a different issue. Wait, no, the current grading system (since 2014) groups Gleason scores into grade groups. However, the original Gleason system did have scores from 2-10. But in modern reporting, scores below 6 are rarely used. However, the text here mentions "Gleason score 3", which is a very low score. But the user's instruction is to report the major and minor as "major+minor=sum". If the text only provides the sum, perhaps we can't split it into major and minor. But the allowed values say "preferably" that format. If the sum is given but not the breakdown, maybe we can put "3" as the sum, but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Alternatively, if the sum is 3, but the breakdown isn't given, maybe the answer is NA. But the user says "preferably" the major+minor=sum, but if that's not possible, perhaps NA. However, the text does mention "Gleason score 3", which is the sum. So maybe the answer is "3+0=3" assuming that the major is 3 and minor is 0. But in reality, Gleason scores are the sum of the two most prevalent grades, each from 1 to 5. So a score of 3 would be, for example, 2+1=3 or 1+2=3. But the lowest grade in current practice is 3+3=6. However, the text here is using an older or different system. The user's instruction is to take the data as presented. So if the text says "Gleason score 3", even if it's debatable, the answer should be 3+0=3? Or maybe the breakdown isn't provided, so we can't know. But the user wants the reported Gleason grade. Since the text mentions the score as 3, but not the breakdown, perhaps the answer is NA. But the user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". So maybe the answer is NA because the individual grades aren't specified. Alternatively, if the sum is given, but the breakdown isn't, maybe we can't structure it properly. The user might expect that if the sum is given, but the breakdown isn't, then it's not in the required format, hence NA. But the problem is that the user allows "NA" for benign, but in this case, if malignant is "yes", then Gleason should be reported. However, the text doesn't provide the breakdown. So perhaps the answer is NA for the Gleason grade because the individual grades aren't specified, even though the sum is mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "3+0=3" assuming that the minor is 0. But that's an assumption. The text says "Gleason score 3", which is the sum. But without the breakdown, we can't know. So in this case, the answer should be NA because the required format is major+minor=sum, and the data doesn't provide that. But the user's instruction says "preferably" that format, so maybe it's allowed to just put the sum if that's all that's available. But the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So if the sum is 3, but the breakdown isn't given, perhaps the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "3=3" but that's not the required format. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The user's example might help, but since there's none, I have to decide. Since the text mentions "Gleason score 3" (sum) but not the individual grades, the structured data can't be filled in the required format. Therefore, the answer for Gleason grade is NA. But wait, the user says "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum. So if the sum is given but not the breakdown, maybe we can't comply, hence NA. So in this case, the answer is NA for the Gleason grade.

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant tumor findings: yes (since Gleason score is mentioned, even if debatable)
3. Gleason grade: NA (because the breakdown isn't provided)
