Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields in a JSON format. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The text clearly states "Karsinoomaa todettiin", meaning carcinoma was found. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the reported Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text says Gleason 3+3=6. Since there are malignant findings, we report this as "3+3=6". If there were no malignancies, it would be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. "Höyläyslastuja" is indeed associated with TURP. The carcinoma is confirmed, so malignancy is present. Gleason score is explicitly given. All seems to fit. No other data points are needed. The answer should be concise and follow the specified syntax.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset löydökset": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+3=6"
}
```
