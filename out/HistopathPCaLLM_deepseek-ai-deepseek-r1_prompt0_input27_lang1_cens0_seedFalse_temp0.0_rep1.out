Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into specific JSON fields. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the three fields to extract are: sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, NA), presence of malignancy (kyllä, ei, NA), and Gleason grade in "major+minor=sum" format or NA if benign.

Looking at the input text: "Yhteensä 13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla. Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti blokeissa F & G, joiden kasvutapa oli Gleason 3+3=6."

Sample type: The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical in a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type should be TURP.

Malignancy: The text mentions "Karsinoomaa todettiin" which means carcinoma was found. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Gleason grade: The report states "Gleason 3+3=6". The format required is "major+minor=sum", so "3+3=6".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Since there's only one Gleason score mentioned, that's the one to use. All other fields fit the allowed values. No NA needed here since all info is present.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+3=6"
}
```
