Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Yhteensä tusinam grammaa prostatasta lähtöisin oelvaa kudosmateriaalia ajettiin kahdeksassa erässä." The term "ajettiin" might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in pieces. So the sample type here is likely "TURP". The options are biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. TURP seems correct.

Next, malignancy. The text says "kasvutavat lopuissa näytteistä ei noudattanut normaaleja prostatasyövän erilaistumista" which translates to the growth patterns didn't follow normal prostate cancer differentiation. However, it also mentions "juuri ja juuri väitetysti Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." So there's a mention of Gleason 3, which is considered a low-grade cancer. Since Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, this indicates malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3". But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". However, the text only mentions a single score of 3. In Gleason scoring, typically there are two numbers (e.g., 3+4=7). If only one pattern is mentioned, sometimes it's considered as both major and minor being the same. But in clinical practice, if only one grade is given, it might be a combined score. However, the user instructions specify "major+minor=sum" as integers. Since the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", maybe it's referring to a combined score of 3, which is unusual. Wait, Gleason scores are usually a sum of two grades, each ranging from 3 to 5. A sum of 3 would mean 1+2, but that's outdated. However, the current system starts at 3. Maybe the report is referring to a primary pattern of 3, but without a secondary, the sum can't be determined. But the user instructions say to use "major+minor=sum". If only one component is mentioned, perhaps it's considered as both major and minor being 3, leading to 3+3=6. But the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which might be the sum. Alternatively, maybe the pathologist is uncertain and mentions a possible 3, but not confirmed. The text says "juuri ja juuri väitetysti" which means "barely allegedly", so it's uncertain. But since the user wants the reported Gleason, even if uncertain, perhaps we should put 3+3=6? But the example in the problem statement might have a different approach. Wait, the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If there's a mention of Gleason 3, but it's uncertain, maybe the sum is 3+3=6. However, the text says "pienin määrin" (in small amounts), so maybe the major and minor are both 3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the report only mentions a single 3, maybe the sum is 3, but that's not standard. However, the user might expect "NA" if it's not clear. Wait, the third field's instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." Since the malignancy is "kyllä", we can't use NA. But the report's Gleason is uncertain. The text says "juuri ja juuri väitetysti Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." So they barely could have detected a Gleason score of 3. But Gleason score is a sum. If it's 3, that would be 1+2, which is outdated. Current practice starts at 3+3=6. So maybe the report is using an old system, or there's a translation error. Alternatively, maybe the "pisteytys 3" refers to the primary pattern, not the sum. If the primary is 3 and secondary is 3, sum is 6. But the text doesn't specify. Since the user wants the reported value, even if it's unclear, perhaps we should put 3+3=6. But the text says "pisteytystä 3", which is the sum. But a sum of 3 is not possible in current grading. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the pathologist is referring to a pattern 3, not the sum, and the user expects the sum. If the sum isn't provided, maybe the answer is "NA". But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so "NA" isn't allowed. Hmm. The user instructions say to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. If the sum isn't explicitly given, but components are, we can calculate. But here, only a single 3 is mentioned. Maybe the pathologist intended the sum as 3, but that's invalid. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they meant 3+3=6. Given the uncertainty, but following the instruction to take the worst lesion and report the Gleason as per the text, perhaps the answer is "3+3=6". But the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which in Finnish could mean "Gleason score of 3", which is not standard. Alternatively, maybe the pathologist is referring to the primary pattern as 3, and the secondary is not mentioned. In that case, the sum can't be determined. But the user wants the reported value. Since the text mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3", even if it's non-standard, perhaps we should report it as "3+0=3", but that's not valid. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the sum isn't properly reported. But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so "NA" is not allowed. This is a bit of a dilemma. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest answer is "3+3=6" assuming that the mention of Gleason 3 refers to both primary and secondary patterns. Alternatively, if the sum is 3, but that's invalid, maybe the answer is "NA". But the user might expect us to extract what's there. Since the text explicitly says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", even if it's incorrect, perhaps we should put "3+3=6" as the closest valid option. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the Gleason score isn't properly formed. But the instructions say to report it for malignant cases. Hmm. I think the correct approach here is to note that the report mentions Gleason score 3, which is not a valid sum, but perhaps the pathologist intended 3+3=6. Alternatively, if the sum is 3, but that's invalid, maybe the answer is "NA". However, since the user expects a structured answer, and the options are "major+minor=sum" or "NA", and the text mentions a Gleason score of 3, which is invalid, but the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", perhaps the answer is "3+3=6" as the most plausible, even if the text is ambiguous. Alternatively, if the sum isn't properly reported, maybe "NA". But the user might prefer capturing the mentioned value. Wait, the user's example in the problem statement might help. Let me check. The user provided an example where the answer was "3+4=7". So if the text mentions "Gleason 3+4=7", then the answer is that. In this case, the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which is the sum. But since a sum of 3 is invalid, perhaps the answer is "NA". But the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so "NA" isn't allowed. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "3+3=6" assuming that the score is 3+3. But the text doesn't specify. This is tricky. Given the uncertainty, but following the instruction to report the worst lesion, and the mention of Gleason 3, even if it's unclear, perhaps the answer is "3+3=6". Alternatively, if the sum is not properly formed, maybe "NA". But the user might expect us to take the mentioned value as is. Since the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which translates to "Gleason score of 3", but that's invalid, perhaps the answer is "NA". However, the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", so "NA" is not allowed. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the pathologist intended a Gleason score of 3+3=6, even if the text is ambiguous. So the answer would be "3+3=6".
