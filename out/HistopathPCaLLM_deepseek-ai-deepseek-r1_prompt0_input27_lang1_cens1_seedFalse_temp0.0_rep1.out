Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample origin, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Yhteensä tusinam grammaa prostatasta lähtöisin oelvaa kudosmateriaalia ajettiin kahdeksassa erässä." The key terms here are "prostatasta" (from prostate) and "ajettiin" which I think refers to transurethral resection, hence TURP. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So I'll go with TURP here.

Next, whether there's malignancy. The text says "kasvutavat lopuissa näytteistä ei noudattanut normaaleja prostatasyövän erilaistumista" which translates to the growth patterns didn't follow normal prostate cancer differentiation. But then it mentions "juuri ja juuri väitetysti Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." So there's a mention of Gleason 3, which is considered cancerous. However, the phrasing is uncertain: "juuri ja juuri väitetysti" (barely allegedly) and "ehkä" (maybe). But since Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, even if it's minimal, it's still malignant. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3". Since Gleason scores are typically given as a sum of the two most common patterns, like 3+3=6. But here, only a single 3 is mentioned. The user instructions specify "major+minor=sum" as integers. However, if only one component is mentioned, maybe it's considered as both major and minor? But in standard practice, Gleason score requires two numbers. The text here is unclear, but since it's stated as "Gleason pisteytystä 3", maybe they are referring to pattern 3, but without a sum. However, the user might expect a sum. But since the text doesn't provide both, perhaps the answer should be NA? Wait, no. The third field says to put "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant cases, else NA. Since we determined malignancy is present, but the Gleason is only mentioned as 3, perhaps the sum is 3+3=6? But the text doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe the report is indicating a Gleason grade group 1, which is 3+3=6. But the text isn't explicit. However, the user instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". If the text only mentions 3, maybe the sum is 3+3=6? Or is it possible that the minor component isn't mentioned? The text says "pienin määrin" (in small amounts), so maybe the major is 3 and minor is 3, leading to 3+3=6. Alternatively, if only one component is 3 and the other isn't mentioned, perhaps it's incomplete. But according to the user's instructions, if it's malignant, we need to report the Gleason. Since the text mentions Gleason 3, even if it's uncertain, perhaps the sum is 3+3=6. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is NA because the sum isn't explicitly given. But the user says to report "major+minor=sum" as integers. If the text only mentions 3, maybe the sum is 3+0=3? But that's not standard. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which could mean the primary pattern is 3, but without a secondary pattern. However, in clinical practice, Gleason score is the sum of the two most common patterns. If only one is mentioned, maybe the secondary is also 3. So 3+3=6. Alternatively, if the secondary is not mentioned, perhaps it's considered incomplete. But given the user's instructions, I think the safest bet is to put 3+3=6. So the answer would be "3+3=6". 

Wait, but the text says "juuri ja juuri väitetysti Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." So they barely could have detected a Gleason score of 3. But Gleason score is the sum. If they mention "Gleason pisteytystä 3", that would mean the score is 3, which isn't possible because the lowest sum is 6 (3+3). So maybe there's a translation error here. In Finnish, "Gleason pisteytys 3" might refer to the pattern, not the sum. So the primary pattern is 3, but the sum isn't given. In that case, since the sum isn't provided, maybe the answer should be NA. But the user instructions say to report the sum for malignant cases. If the sum isn't provided, but malignancy is present, perhaps the answer is NA. But that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if only the pattern is mentioned, we assume the sum. But I'm not sure. This is a possible ambiguity. Given that the text mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3" and the user wants the sum, but the sum isn't provided, perhaps the answer is NA. But the presence of any Gleason score implies malignancy. However, the user's third field is "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If it's reported as 3, even if that's the pattern, but the sum isn't given, then maybe the answer is NA. But I'm confused. In real cases, Gleason is reported as, for example, 3+4=7. If the text only says 3, perhaps it's the pattern, not the sum. Therefore, since the sum isn't explicitly stated, the answer should be NA. But the user might expect that if a Gleason is mentioned, even if it's just a pattern, to infer the sum. But without knowing the secondary pattern, it's impossible. So in this case, since the sum isn't provided, the answer should be NA. But the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" (malignant findings) should have the sum. Since we determined malignancy is present, but the Gleason sum isn't provided, maybe the answer is NA. But the text does mention "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which might be a translation error, and actually refers to the sum. If the sum is 3, that's not possible. So perhaps the original text meant pattern 3, but the user's system expects the sum. Therefore, since the sum isn't given, the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the user considers that "Gleason 3" in the text refers to the sum, which is impossible, so it's a mistake, but we have to go with what's written. But since the sum can't be 3, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if only one pattern is mentioned, we take it as both major and minor. So 3+3=6. That's possible. Given that the text says "Gleason pisteytystä 3", perhaps the intended sum is 6, but written as 3. But that's speculative. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to report "major+minor=sum" as integers, and the text only mentions 3, perhaps the answer is NA. However, in real clinical reports, sometimes the primary and secondary patterns are mentioned separately. If the text had said "Gleason 3 + 3 = 6", then the answer is clear. But here, it's "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which is ambiguous. Given that, and the user's requirement to only report the worst lesion and not nested structures, perhaps the answer is NA. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me recheck the original text: "juuri ja juuri väitetysti Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." So they barely could have detected a Gleason score of 3. Since Gleason scores start at 6, this is likely a translation error or misunderstanding. Maybe the original report meant pattern 3, but the user's system expects the sum. Therefore, since the sum isn't provided, the answer is NA. But the presence of any Gleason components (even if incomplete) in a malignant case would require the sum. However, without both components, we can't calculate the sum. Therefore, the answer for Gleason should be NA. 

Wait, but the user's third field says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if the case is malignant (which we answered "kyllä"), then we need to report the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format. If the report doesn't specify both major and minor, but mentions a single pattern, do we assume the minor is the same? For example, if only major 3 is mentioned, is minor also 3? In some cases, pathologists might report only the primary pattern, but the sum is inferred. However, according to guidelines, the Gleason score should include both primary and secondary patterns. If the text only mentions one, perhaps it's incomplete. But according to the user's instructions, we need to report the sum as "major+minor=sum". If the text doesn't provide both, maybe we can't report it, hence NA. But the user says "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" (for malignant findings) the answer should be the sum. So if the sum isn't provided, but malignancy is present, do we still put NA? The user's instruction says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka" so if it's reported, even partially, but the sum isn't clear, perhaps we put NA. But in this case, the text mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3", which might be the sum, but that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe the pathologist intended to write 3+3=6 but abbreviated it as 3. In that case, the answer would be "3+3=6". But this is an assumption. Given the ambiguity, but following the user's instruction to report the sum as "major+minor=sum", and the text only mentions 3, perhaps the answer is NA. However, since the user's example might expect that if a Gleason is mentioned, even if the sum isn't clear, to infer it. But I'm not sure. This is a tough call. 

In conclusion, the sample type is TURP. Malignancy is present (kyllä). Gleason is reported as 3, but since the sum isn't clear, perhaps NA. But given that the user's instructions require the sum for malignant cases, and the text mentions Gleason 3, maybe the answer is 3+3=6. I'll go with that, assuming that the mention of 3 refers to both primary and secondary patterns.
