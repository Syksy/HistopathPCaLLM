Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Yhteensä tusinam grammaa prostatasta lähtöisin oelvaa kudosmateriaalia ajettiin kahdeksassa erässä." The term "ajettiin" might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a common procedure. So I'll check if "TURP" is one of the allowed values. Yes, it is. So the first answer is "TURP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "kasvutavat lopuissa näytteistä ei noudattanut normaaleja prostatasyövän erilaistumista" which translates to the growth patterns not following normal prostate cancer differentiation. However, it also mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin." Gleason 3 is typically considered a low-grade cancer, which is malignant. So even though it's minimal, it's still malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions "Gleason pisteytystä 3". Since it's a single score, but the required format is "major+minor=sum". However, if only one component is mentioned, maybe it's both major and minor being 3, leading to 3+3=6. But the text says "juuri ja juuri väitetysti" which implies some uncertainty. However, the presence of Gleason 3 suggests that the sum is 3+3=6. So the answer is "3+3=6".

Wait, but the user said to report the worst lesion's results. The text mentions "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". The Gleason mentioned is 3, but in some cases, if only one pattern is found, maybe the major and minor are the same. So 3+3=6 is correct. Also, since there's malignancy, we shouldn't return NA here. So the third field is "3+3=6".
