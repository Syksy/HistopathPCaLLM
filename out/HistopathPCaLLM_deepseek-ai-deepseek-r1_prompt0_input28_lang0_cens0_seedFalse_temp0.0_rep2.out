Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "six biopsy cylinders" taken because of elevated PSA. So the original sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The report talks about adenocarcinoma in multiple foci, which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The highest grade mentioned is in Focus #1 with Gleason 4+4=8. Even though other foci have lower sums like 7, the highest is 8. So the format should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Check allowed values: sample type is "biopsy", malignant is "yes", Gleason is "4+4=8". All correct. No NA needed here since all info is present. Double-check the text to confirm there's no mention of RP or TURP, and that the highest Gleason is indeed 8. Yep, looks good.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
