Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the examination mentions "six different sites of interest" but doesn't specify the procedure type. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't present. The regions of interest are being inspected, but without explicit mention of the sample type, so I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "atypical growth patterns" and "possible pre-malignant changes" in regions 1 and 2. Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, so it's not confirmed as cancerous. Region 3 has findings needing further inspection. The summary says regions warrant further inspection but doesn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy, the answer here should be no. Wait, but the user said "malignant tumor findings" – pre-malignant is not malignant. So "no" is correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were some atypical cells, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So all three answers are NA, no, NA respectively.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any terms. The sample type isn't mentioned, so NA. Malignant is not confirmed, so no. Gleason grade only applies if malignant, so NA. That seems right.
