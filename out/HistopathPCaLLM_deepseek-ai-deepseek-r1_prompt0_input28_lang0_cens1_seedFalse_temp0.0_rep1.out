Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the examination mentions "six different sites of interest" but doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't present. The regions of interest are being inspected, which might suggest a biopsy, but since it's not explicitly mentioned, I should go with NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "atypical growth patterns" and "possible pre-malignant changes" in regions 1 and 2. Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, so that's not a yes. Region 3 has findings needing further inspection but no confirmation. Hyperplastic changes are noted, which are benign. Since there's no mention of confirmed malignancy, the answer here should be no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignant finding is no, the Gleason grade would be NA. Even if there were pre-malignant changes, Gleason grading applies to confirmed malignancies. So definitely NA here.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Check each field again. Sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. That fits the requirements. Only the most severe lesion is considered, but since none are malignant, all entries are based on the overall findings. Alright, that should cover it.
