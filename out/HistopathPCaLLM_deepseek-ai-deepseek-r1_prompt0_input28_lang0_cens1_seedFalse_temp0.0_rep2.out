Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the examination mentions "six different sites of interest" and regions like "front left side", "middle left side", etc. The terms used like "atypical growth patterns" and "sent to pathologist for further evaluation" suggest this might be a biopsy since multiple sites are sampled, which is common in biopsies. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP procedures. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "atypical growth patterns", "possible pre-malignant changes", and "hyperplastic changes". Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, and atypical cells aren't confirmed as cancer. The summary says regions warrant further inspection but doesn't confirm malignancy. So the answer here should be "no" because there's no definitive mention of malignancy, only suspicions that need more tests.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports using NA here.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, all findings are non-malignant or pre-malignant, so the highest severity is still not confirmed as cancer. Therefore, the structured data should reflect that with the determined values.
