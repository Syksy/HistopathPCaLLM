Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and the reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä otettuna..." which translates to "six biopsy cylinders taken..." So the sample type is biopsy.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. There are multiple mentions of carcinoma and Gleason scores, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The highest mentioned is in pesäke 1 (focus 1) with Gleason 4+4=8. Even though other foci have lower scores like 4+3=7 and 3+4=7, the worst is 8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, using the specified keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just flat. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted, especially the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". 

Double-checking the original text confirms all points. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is present, and the highest Gleason is 4+4=8. Everything seems to fit the required structure.
