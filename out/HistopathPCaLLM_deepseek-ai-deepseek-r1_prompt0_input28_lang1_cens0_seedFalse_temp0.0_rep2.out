Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and the reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The report starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä," which translates to six biopsy cores. So the original sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) and "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue), which are malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the worst lesion. There are three lesions mentioned. Pesäke 1 has Gleason 4+4=8. Pesäke 2 has 4+3=7, and Pesäke 3 has 3+4=7. The highest sum is 8 from Pesäke 1. So the Gleason grade should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and uses the exact allowed values. Also, check that for malignancy, since there are malignant findings, Gleason isn't NA. Everything seems to fit. No typos in the keys. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8.
