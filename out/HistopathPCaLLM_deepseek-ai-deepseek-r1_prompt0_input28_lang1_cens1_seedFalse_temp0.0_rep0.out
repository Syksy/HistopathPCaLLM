Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the patient had a "kohonneen PSA-statuksen takia" (due to elevated PSA status), which usually leads to a biopsy. The report mentions "materiaali lähetetään patologille XYZ jatkotutkimuksia varten" (material sent to pathologist XYZ for further examination), which sounds like a biopsy was taken. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "atyyppisia kasvupatterneja" (atypical growth patterns) in RoI #1, "mahdollisesti esi-maligniteettisia muutoksia" (possibly pre-malignant changes) in RoI #2, and "hyperplastisia muutoksia" (hyperplastic changes) overall. However, pre-malignant isn't outright malignant. The summary says the areas are worth further study but doesn't confirm malignancy. So, the answer here might be "ei" (no), but wait. The user specified "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, just atypical and pre-malignant, maybe it's "ei". But sometimes "esi-maligniteetti" could be considered as malignant? Hmm. The key is whether the findings are confirmed as malignant. Since it's "mahdollisesti" (possibly) pre-malignant, not confirmed. So safest answer is "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". But if there's no malignancy, it should be NA. Since we determined malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. But wait, maybe I should double-check. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores, only atypical and pre-malignant changes. No mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason patterns. So definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type biopsy, malignancy no, Gleason NA.
