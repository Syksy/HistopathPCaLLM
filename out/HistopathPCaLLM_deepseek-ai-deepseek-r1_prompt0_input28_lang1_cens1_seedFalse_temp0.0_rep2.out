Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the material is from six regions of interest (RoIs) due to elevated PSA. The report mentions "annotated candidates as regions of interest worthy of further investigation." There's no mention of a specific procedure like TURP or RP. Since it's about taking samples from specific areas, maybe it's a biopsy. But the text doesn't explicitly state "biopsy." However, given that they're looking at multiple RoIs and sending material to a pathologist, it's likely a biopsy. If unsure, maybe default to NA, but I think biopsy is correct here.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "atyyppisia kasvupatterneja" (atypical growth patterns) in RoI #1, "esi-maligniteettisia muutoksia" (pre-malignant changes) in RoI #2 (80% of material), and hyperplastic changes. Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, and atypical could be suspicious but not confirmed. The conclusion says the regions need further investigation, but there's no explicit mention of malignancy. So, the answer here might be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy, only pre-malignant or atypical. But wait, the question is about pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä (malignant findings). Since pre-malignant isn't malignant, and atypical isn't confirmed as cancer, the answer should be "ei". However, sometimes reports can be tricky. Let me check again. The text says "esi-maligniteettisia" which is pre-malignant, so not malignant. So "ei" is correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since we determined malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some findings, unless malignancy is confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. The text doesn't mention Gleason scores, so definitely NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy (since they're taking specific regions, likely biopsy)
2. Malignancy: ei (no malignant findings, only pre-malignant and atypical)
3. Gleason: NA
