Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text starts with "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." The mention of the prostate being obtained as a fresh sample and the weight makes me think this is a radical prostatectomy (RP), since that's when the entire prostate is removed. Biopsy would be taking samples, TURP is for removing tissue from the prostate, but the weight here suggests the whole gland was removed. So I'll go with RP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" which is a malignant tumor. Also, terms like "penetrated the capsule" and "perineural invasion" are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is definitely yes.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The summary states "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." In Gleason scoring, the sum is the addition of the most common (major) and next most common (minor) grade patterns. The text also mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation... smaller portion as grade 4." Wait, that seems conflicting. If both major and minor are grade 4, the sum would be 8. But the summary says sum 7. Let me check again. The main text says "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4." Hmm, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the summary says sum 7. So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 3, adding to 7. Maybe in the detailed description, the "poorly differentiated" and "fused glandular structures" could correspond to grade 4 and 3. Even though the text says "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4," maybe there's a mistake. But the summary explicitly states sum 7, so I should go with that. The correct format would be "4+3=7" or "3+4=7". The summary doesn't specify the order, but in the main text, "mostly grade 4" suggests major is 4, minor 3. So "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: sample type RP, malignant yes, Gleason 4+3=7. Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion. Since the left lobe has the findings and the summary mentions the score sum 7, that's the most severe.
