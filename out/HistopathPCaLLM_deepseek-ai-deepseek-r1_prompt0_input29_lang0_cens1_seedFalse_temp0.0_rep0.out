Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." The samples are labeled A-F with locations like left lower, right lower, etc. This setup sounds like a biopsy procedure where multiple cores are taken from different regions. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, which might be contamination. It also mentions the assessment of potential poor differentiation and possible fusing glandular structures, which are concerning for malignancy. However, the summary says "Score sum determination was not possible" which refers to the Gleason score. Since they couldn't confirm the presence of malignant cells definitively here and need re-examination, the answer might be "no" because the current samples didn't show malignancy, but there's uncertainty. Alternatively, if the suspicion is high but not confirmed, maybe "NA". But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report doesn't explicitly state malignancy was found, just that they need to check for it. So maybe "no" because the current samples didn't show it, but they need to re-examine. Or perhaps "NA" if the information isn't available. Hmm. The key is whether there's a definite mention of malignant findings. Since the samples A and C are non-prostatic, and the others aren't mentioned as having tumor, but the assessment for poor differentiation (which is a feature of malignancy) was requested but not concluded. So the presence of malignant findings isn't confirmed here. So the answer would be "no" because the current samples didn't show malignancy, but there's a need for further testing. Wait, but "no" would mean no malignancy found. However, maybe the report is inconclusive. The summary says "Score sum determination was not possible", which is about Gleason, but doesn't say if malignancy is present. The user instruction says to answer based on the most severe lesion. If there's no mention of malignancy in the samples that were assessed (since A and C are non-prostatic and others aren't mentioned), then maybe "no". Alternatively, if the request to assess poor differentiation implies suspicion but not confirmed, maybe "NA". But according to the allowed values, "NA" is for when it's not applicable or not mentioned. Since the report doesn't state any malignant findings, but mentions the need to check for it, perhaps "no" is safer. Or maybe "NA" if the presence isn't confirmed. I think "no" because the existing samples didn't show malignancy, but the answer might be "NA" if the data isn't available. The report says "non-prostatic tissue" in A and C, but other samples (B, D, E, F) aren't mentioned. However, the key is that the summary says "Score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined." So maybe the other samples (B, D, E, F) weren't mentioned as having tumor either. So the presence of malignant tumor findings isn't confirmed, hence "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as numbers, or "NA" if benign. Since the summary states that the score sum determination wasn't possible and samples need re-examination, there's no Gleason grade reported. So the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason is NA.
