Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the samples are labeled as A-F with locations like left lower, right lower, etc. The way the samples are taken (A-F with different regions) sounds more like a biopsy procedure, where multiple cores are taken from different areas. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP. So I think the original sample type is "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that samples A and C have non-prostatic tissue, which suggests contamination. It also talks about assessing poor differentiation and glandular structure, which are related to cancer. However, the summary states that the score sum determination (Gleason) wasn't possible and samples need re-examination. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy found, but there's a mention of tumor cells' differentiation stages not being assessed, maybe the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. But wait, the user said to consider the most severe lesion. The fact that they were looking for poor differentiation (which is a higher grade) might imply malignancy, but the report doesn't confirm it. Hmm, tricky. The answer might be "NA" because the samples were contaminated and couldn't be assessed properly. So the presence of malignant findings isn't determined here, hence "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The summary clearly states that the score sum determination wasn't possible, and samples need re-examination. So there's no Gleason grade reported here. The answer should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are NA, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure I'm not missing any implicit info. The report mentions tumor cells' differentiation stages couldn't be assessed, but does that mean there were tumor cells? If so, maybe malignant is "yes". Wait, the statement says "differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed". The presence of tumor cells would imply malignancy. But the key here is whether the report confirms malignancy. If they couldn't assess differentiation, maybe they found tumor cells but couldn't grade them. However, the samples A and C were non-prostatic, so maybe the tumor cells are in other samples? The report isn't clear. The user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Since the samples that were of interest (A and C) were non-prostatic, maybe the other samples (B, D, E, F) weren't mentioned as having tumor cells. The summary says the score sum couldn't be determined, so maybe there's no malignancy confirmed. Therefore, malignant findings would be "no" or "NA". Since the samples were contaminated and couldn't be assessed, "NA" is safer. So final answers: biopsy, NA, NA.
