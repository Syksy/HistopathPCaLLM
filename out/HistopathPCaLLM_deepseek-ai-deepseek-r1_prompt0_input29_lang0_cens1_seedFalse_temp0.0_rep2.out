Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." The samples are labeled A-F with locations like left lower, right lower, etc. This setup sounds like a biopsy procedure where multiple cores are taken from different regions. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, possibly contamination. It also mentions the assessment of "potential poor differentiation" and "fusing glandular structure", which are terms related to cancer. However, the summary says "Score sum determination was not possible" which refers to the Gleason score. Since they couldn't confirm the presence of malignant cells due to insufficient or contaminated samples, but there's a suspicion, I'm a bit torn. The key here is whether malignant cells were definitively found. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, just that they need to re-examine. So maybe the answer here is "no" because the current samples didn't show malignancy, but there's a need for further testing. Alternatively, if the suspicion is enough to consider it as yes, but the instructions say to report based on findings. Since the samples A and C (which were of interest) were non-prostatic, and the others aren't mentioned as malignant, maybe "no" is safer. But wait, the colleague was looking for poor differentiation and glandular structures, which are cancer indicators. However, the summary says the score couldn't be determined, so maybe there's no confirmation. So "no" or "NA"? The allowed values are yes, no, NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but suggests further testing, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. Wait, but the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If they didn't find any in the samples, but the samples were contaminated, then the answer might be "no" because the available samples didn't show malignancy. But if the samples were inadequate, maybe it's NA. Hmm. The statement says "non-prostatic tissue is observed" in A and C, which were the samples of interest. The other samples (B, D, E, F) aren't mentioned. Since the main samples (A and C) were contaminated, and the others aren't reported, maybe the presence of malignant findings is not confirmed. So the answer would be "no" because the available assessment didn't find malignancy, but the user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. Wait, but if the most severe lesion wasn't found because the samples were bad, then maybe it's "NA". This is a bit ambiguous. The key is that the samples A and C (which were the focus) didn't have prostatic tissue, so they couldn't assess. The other samples might not have been mentioned, so maybe there's no evidence of malignancy. So "no" for malignant findings? Or "NA" because the assessment couldn't be done? The user instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". If the most severe lesion couldn't be assessed due to contamination, then maybe the answer is "NA". But the presence of malignant findings would be "no" if they didn't find any. I think the answer here is "no" because the samples that were examined (A and C) didn't show prostatic tissue, but other samples (B, D, E, F) might have been benign. However, the report doesn't mention any malignant findings in those. Alternatively, if the samples were inadequate, maybe it's "NA". But the allowed values are yes, no, NA. Since the report doesn't state any malignancy found, the answer is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as numbers or "NA" if benign. Since the summary says "Score sum determination was not possible" and the samples need re-examination, the Gleason grade can't be determined. So the answer is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings is no, Gleason is NA.
