Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The original text starts with "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata," which translates to "Fresh sample received from prostate." The term "Tuorenäytteenä" suggests it's a biopsy or possibly a TURP. But wait, TURP is a procedure where part of the prostate is removed, usually for benign enlargement. The report mentions "näytteet otettu seuraavasti" which means samples taken from different areas (A-F). This sounds more like a biopsy where multiple cores are taken from different regions. So the sample type is likely "biopsy." RP (radical prostatectomy) would be if the entire prostate was removed, which isn't mentioned here. So I'll go with "biopsy."

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa" (invasive adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. There's also mention of capsular penetration and perineural invasion, which are signs of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3." The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, so sum is 4+3=7. The summary also says "Pistesumman 7." The required format is "major+minor=sum," so "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, check allowed values: sample type is "biopsy," malignancy is "kyllä," Gleason is "4+3=7." No issues there. All fields are covered, and the answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
