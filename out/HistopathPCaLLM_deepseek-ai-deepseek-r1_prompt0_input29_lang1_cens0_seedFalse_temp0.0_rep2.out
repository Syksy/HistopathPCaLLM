Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata," which translates to "Fresh sample received from the prostate." The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term "tuorenäytteenä" might refer to a fresh sample, but the exact type isn't clear. However, since the sample is taken from different parts (A-F) with multiple cores, this sounds more like a biopsy procedure rather than RP or TURP. So I'll go with "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa" (invasive adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "luokan 4" and "luokka 3," with the summary stating "pistesumman 7." Gleason scores are typically the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. Here, major is 4 and minor is 3, summing to 7. So the format should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, since the worst lesion is considered, even if there are other findings, the highest Gleason score is taken. The sample type is a bit ambiguous, but biopsy seems the most fitting. The answer should be in the specified syntax without any markdown.
