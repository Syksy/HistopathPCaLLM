Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "tuore prostatakudos materiaali" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material. The samples are labeled A-F, which is typical for biopsy cores. The mention of "näytteenottoproseduurissa" (sampling procedure) and the fact that they took multiple samples from different areas (left, right, upper, lower) suggests it's a biopsy. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the type is likely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, indicating contamination. However, the main points of interest (kotheena) were these samples, and they were to be re-examined for possible poor differentiation and gland fusion. The summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" (determining the Gleason score wasn't possible) because samples A and C need re-examination. Since the problematic samples are being retested and no malignancy is explicitly mentioned in the other samples, but the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed either. The report doesn't state any malignant findings, just that some samples were contaminated. So, the presence of malignancy is unclear. But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since the main samples (A and C) were contaminated and couldn't be assessed, but there's no mention of malignancy in other samples, maybe the answer here is "ei" (no). Wait, but the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the worst lesion is not found because the samples were contaminated, then maybe the answer is "NA". Hmm, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't say it's absent. Since the samples of interest (A and C) were contaminated, and others weren't mentioned, maybe the presence is "NA" because it couldn't be determined. But the user says to take the worst lesion. If the worst possible is not determined, then maybe "NA" is correct. Alternatively, if the other samples (B, D, E, F) were okay but not mentioned, but the report doesn't say they found cancer. So perhaps the answer is "ei" (no malignancy found) or "NA" (couldn't assess). The key is that the summary says determining the Gleason wasn't possible, and the samples A and C need re-examination. Since the main samples were contaminated, and no malignancy is reported in others, maybe the presence is "ei". But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The text says "näytteistä indekseillä A ja C havaittiin kudosta joka ei ollut prostatasta" (samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue). The other samples (B, D, E, F) aren't mentioned as having cancer. The user instructions say to report the worst lesion. If the worst lesion is not found because the samples were contaminated, then maybe the presence is "NA". But the presence of malignancy is asked. If the report doesn't mention any malignancy, but the samples couldn't be assessed properly, then maybe the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if the other samples (B, D, E, F) were examined and no malignancy was found, but the text doesn't say that. The text only mentions A and C as problematic. The other samples might not have been mentioned because they were normal, but that's an assumption. Since the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, but the main samples were contaminated, the safest answer is "NA" for malignancy presence. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state any malignancy, but the assessment couldn't be done, then "NA" is appropriate. So for question 2, the answer is "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" (determining the score wasn't possible), so the Gleason is "NA". Since there's no malignancy confirmed, and the score couldn't be determined, it's "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: NA
3. Gleason: NA
