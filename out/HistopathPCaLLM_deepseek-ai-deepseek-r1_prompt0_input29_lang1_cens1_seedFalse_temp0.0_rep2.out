Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "tuore prostatakudos materiaali" which translates to fresh prostate tissue. The mention of samples taken from different areas (A-F) with letters like A, B, etc., suggests a biopsy procedure, as biopsies often take multiple samples from different regions. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions that samples A and C had tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. The summary states that determining the Gleason score wasn't possible and that samples A and C need re-examination. There's no mention of cancer being found, only that some samples were contaminated. Since the problematic samples are to be rechecked, but no malignancy is reported here, the answer should be "ei" (no). However, I need to be careful. The absence of mention doesn't necessarily mean absence of malignancy. Wait, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the samples that could have shown malignancy (A and C) were contaminated, then maybe the other samples (B, D, E, F) didn't show malignancy. The report doesn't state any cancer found, so "ei" seems correct.

Third, the Gleason grade. The summary explicitly says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" (determining the score wasn't possible). Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is automatically "NA". So that's consistent.

So the structured data would be:
1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA

  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
