Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so the answer here should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically all longitudinal macrosections... present normal benign growth." Also, the summary states "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignancy, so the answer here is no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the tumor findings are benign, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but the report doesn't mention any lesions, so that's covered. The JSON should not have nested structures, just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check each part again to confirm. Original sample: autopsy, which isn't listed, so NA. Malignant: no. Gleason: NA. That all fits.
