Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, it says "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen, but the original sample mentioned is autopsy. Since autopsy isn't listed, maybe the answer here is NA. But wait, the first line says "prostatectomy specimen," which is RP. However, the original sample is specified as autopsy. The instructions say to use the allowed values, so since autopsy isn't an option, NA is correct here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The summary mentions "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... tissue changes... normal aging." The microscopic sections show normal benign growth, no tumor growth in seminal vesicles, clean resection surfaces. So no malignancy found. The answer here should be "no".

Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason grade is NA.

So the structured JSON should have NA for sample type, no for malignancy, and NA for Gleason.
