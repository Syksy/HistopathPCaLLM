Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, it says "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary mentions "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... tissue changes... normal aging." Also, "normal benign growth" and "no tumor growth" in the seminal vesicles. So no malignancy found. The answer here is no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The user wants "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA.

Need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered, but the text doesn't mention any lesions beyond benign changes. So all answers are NA, no, NA respectively. Check for any possible misinterpretations. The sample type is autopsy, which isn't listed, so NA. No mention of malignancy, so no. Hence, the JSON should reflect that.
