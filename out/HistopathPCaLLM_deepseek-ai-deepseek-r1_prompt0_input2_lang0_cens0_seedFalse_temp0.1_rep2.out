Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "normal benign growth," "no abnormal growth," and "contain no tumor growth." The summary also states "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state..." So there's no mention of malignancy. The answer here is no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the tumor findings are no, the Gleason grade is NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings, so that's straightforward. Double-checking each part to confirm. Yep, all looks correct.
