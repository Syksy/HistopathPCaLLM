Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary says the samples can only "marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The word "potential" suggests uncertainty. There's no definitive confirmation of malignancy, so the answer here is no. Wait, but "potential" might mean it's possible but not confirmed. Since the report isn't conclusive, maybe NA is better? Hmm, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If there's no clear evidence, perhaps NA is appropriate. But the user says to take the most severe lesion. The summary mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's not confirmed. So maybe the answer is no, because it's not confirmed as malignant. Or is NA more accurate here? The instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if it's uncertain, maybe NA is correct. But I need to check if "potential" implies that malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. Since the report says they can't reliably infer further findings due to inflammation and age-related changes, it's possible that malignancy can't be confirmed. So the answer here would be NA. Wait, but the summary says "potential adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor. However, the report states that the samples can only be marginally used to characterize it. So maybe the presence is uncertain. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If it's uncertain, perhaps NA is the right choice here. Alternatively, if "potential" is considered as a possible yes, but the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. However, since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is no. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read the summary: "samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue..." So they can't confirm it, but there's a possibility. Since the presence isn't confirmed, the answer should be no? Or is it NA? The user's instruction says "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the findings are inconclusive, then maybe NA. But the options are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't definitively state malignancy, then it's either no or NA. Since the report mentions "potential," which is a possibility but not confirmed, perhaps NA is more appropriate. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The key is whether there's a definite finding. If it's uncertain, NA. If it's ruled out, no. Here, it's uncertain, so NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The answer should be in the format "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the report doesn't mention any Gleason grading (no numbers like 3+4=7), and the malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (autopsy isn't an allowed value)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (uncertain, potential but not confirmed)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no mention of Gleason score)
