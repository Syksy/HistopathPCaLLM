Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary says the samples can only "marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The word "potential" suggests uncertainty. There's no definitive confirmation of malignancy, so the answer here is no. If it were confirmed, it would be yes, but since it's uncertain, it's safer to go with no or maybe NA. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions it as a possibility, maybe NA is more appropriate here. Hmm, but the instructions say "malignant tumor findings." If there's no clear evidence, perhaps it's "no." But the summary says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," which might imply that malignancy is possible but not confirmed. Since the findings can't be reliably inferred due to other changes, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, the user instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if it's uncertain, maybe NA is correct. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states that further inspection is needed, so the presence isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer should be NA. Wait, but the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." The most severe mentioned is "potential adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. However, since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is no. But the summary says "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." So the presence is uncertain. Therefore, the answer is NA. Wait, but the allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions potential, maybe it's NA. Alternatively, if the presence is possible but not confirmed, maybe it's no. But the user might consider "potential" as a possible yes. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The key is whether the report states there are malignant findings. Since it's uncertain and requires further inspection, the answer should be NA. Because the findings can't be reliably inferred, as per the text.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is uncertain (NA in the previous field), the Gleason grade would be NA. Even if there was a potential adenocarcinoma, without a confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but let me check again. Original sample type: autopsy isn't listed, so NA. Malignant findings: the report mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but due to limitations, they can't confirm. So the presence isn't confirmed, hence NA. Gleason grade: since malignancy isn't confirmed, it's NA.
