Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary says the samples can only "marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The word "potential" suggests uncertainty. There's no definitive confirmation of malignancy, so the answer here is no. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If it's uncertain, maybe NA? Hmm. The instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if it's not confirmed, maybe NA is better. But the summary mentions "potential adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. However, since it's not confirmed, perhaps the answer is no. Or maybe NA because it's uncertain. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report states that further inspection is needed and they can't reliably infer further findings due to inflammation and age-related changes, it's not confirmed. So maybe NA is appropriate here. Wait, but the user said "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the findings are uncertain, but there's a mention of potential, does that count as yes? Probably not. The answer should be no if no definitive malignancy is found, but the report says "potential." Hmm. Maybe NA is better here because it's inconclusive. The instructions say "NA" for benign statements. Wait, the third field's NA is for Gleason grade if benign. For the second field, "NA" is allowed. So if the presence of malignancy is uncertain, perhaps NA is correct. But the user's instruction says "malignant tumor findings" – if the report mentions potential, but it's not confirmed, then maybe the answer is no. Because the presence isn't confirmed. Alternatively, if the report can't determine, maybe NA. I think in medical terms, if it's not confirmed, it's considered negative unless stated otherwise. But the summary says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" which are not confirmed. So the answer here would be no, because the presence isn't confirmed. Wait, but the question is "were there malignant tumor findings?" If the findings are uncertain, maybe the answer is NA. Let me check the exact wording. The user says: "allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA'." So if the report is inconclusive, then NA. Since the summary states that further inspection is required and they can't reliably confirm malignancy, the answer should be NA. Because the presence isn't definitively yes or no. So NA for the second field.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the report doesn't mention any Gleason grading, and the malignancy is uncertain, the answer here is NA.

So putting it all together: original sample type is NA (autopsy isn't listed), malignant findings is NA (inconclusive), Gleason grade is NA.
