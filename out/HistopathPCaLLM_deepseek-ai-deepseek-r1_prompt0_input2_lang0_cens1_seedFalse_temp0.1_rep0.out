Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." None of the allowed values include autopsy, so the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary says there's a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's noted that further inspection is needed and findings can't be reliably inferred. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the answer here should be NA instead of yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum as whole numbers, or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain (NA in the previous field), there's no confirmed malignant tumor to assign a Gleason score. Therefore, this should also be NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, so all fields except sample type (which is NA) would default to NA. Checking again, the sample type is definitely autopsy, which isn't an allowed value, so NA is correct. The malignancy is potential but not confirmed, so NA. Gleason grade isn't applicable here. The JSON should reflect all three as NA.

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
