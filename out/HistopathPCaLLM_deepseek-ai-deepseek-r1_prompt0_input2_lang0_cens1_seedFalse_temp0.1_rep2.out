Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The summary states that the samples can only "marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The word "potential" suggests uncertainty. There's no definitive confirmation of malignancy, so the answer here is no. If it were confirmed, it would be yes, but since it's uncertain, it's safer to say no or maybe NA. Wait, the instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if the presence is uncertain, maybe NA is appropriate. But the summary says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," which implies they can't confirm. So maybe NA is better here. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions potential, does that count as NA? Or is NA only when it's not mentioned? The user says NA for benign statements. Hmm. The summary says "cannot be reliably inferred" due to other changes. So the presence of malignant findings isn't confirmed, so maybe the answer is no. But the system might not have enough info. The instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if it's uncertain, perhaps NA is correct. But the example in the user's mind might consider uncertain as NA. Let me check the exact wording: "Further findings cannot be reliably inferred... to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." So they can't confirm, so the answer is NA. Wait, but the allowed values for question 2 are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm, but mentions potential, maybe NA is the right choice here. Because the presence isn't confirmed, so it's not yes, but it's not definitively no either. So NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The answer should be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant findings are uncertain (NA in question 2), then the Gleason grade would be NA. Even if there was a mention of adenocarcinoma, if it's not confirmed as malignant, Gleason isn't applicable. So NA.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (autopsy isn't listed)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (uncertain, not confirmed)
3. Gleason grade: NA (since no confirmed malignancy)
