Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report says there's "normaalia kasvustoa" (normal growth), some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia. The summary mentions mild inflammation and age-related changes. No mention of cancer or malignancy. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I didn't miss any mention of cancer. The keywords like "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) and "hyperplasia" (benign) confirm no malignancy. All right, the answer should be correct.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
