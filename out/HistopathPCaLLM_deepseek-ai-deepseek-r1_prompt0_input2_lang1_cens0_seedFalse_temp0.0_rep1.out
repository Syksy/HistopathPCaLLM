Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte", which translates to "radical prostatectomy sample" in Finnish. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The summary states "YHTEENVETO: Prostatassa korkeintaan lievä-asteista tulehdusta ja tyypillisiä ikäpohjaisia muutoksia." This translates to "SUMMARY: In the prostate, at most mild inflammation and typical age-related changes." The report mentions normal growth, some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no signs of malignancy. Terms like "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) in the seminal vesicles also support this. So the presence of malignancy is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, without nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results are included. All values seem to fit the allowed options. Let me double-check each part again to be sure. The sample type is clearly RP, malignancy is absent, and Gleason isn't applicable here. Everything looks good.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
