Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report states that in all macro sections and samples from the apex and base, there's mostly normal tissue. They mention some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia suggestive of benign changes. The summary also talks about mild inflammation and age-related changes. No mention of cancer or malignancy. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings, the value should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the worst lesion's results are included. The answer seems straightforward here as there's no malignancy detected. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I didn't miss any mention of carcinoma or Gleason scores. The report does mention hyperplasia but that's benign. So yes, all three fields are correctly filled as RP, ei, NA.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
