Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, and "radikaali" would be radical. So the sample type here is RP, which is one of the allowed values.

Next, checking for malignancy. The summary says there's mild inflammation and age-related changes. Terms like "normaalia kasvustoa", "atrofiaa", "tulehdusta", and "hyperplasia" suggest benign findings. No mention of carcinoma or malignancy, so the answer here should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". The allowed format is "major+minor=sum", but that's only if malignancy is present. Here, it's not applicable.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the specified keys. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is RP, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That fits the requirements.

```json
{
  "1": "RP",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
```
