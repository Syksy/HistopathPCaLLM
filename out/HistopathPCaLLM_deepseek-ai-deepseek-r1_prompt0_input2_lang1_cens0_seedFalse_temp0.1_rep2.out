Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte". I know "radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the first field should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The summary says there's mild inflammation and age-related changes. Terms like "normaalia kasvustoa", "atrofiaa", "tulehdusta", and "hyperplasiaan viittaavaa kasvua" suggest benign findings. No mention of cancer or malignant cells. So the presence of malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with benign findings.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the allowed values. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is RP, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. That fits all the criteria.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
