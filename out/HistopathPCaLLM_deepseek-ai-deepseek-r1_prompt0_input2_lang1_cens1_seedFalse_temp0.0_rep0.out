Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näyte: Biopsia." The word "Biopsia" is Finnish for biopsy. So the first field should be "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "adenocarcinoomaa" which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7". I need to present this exactly as given, converting the numbers to integers. So "4+3=7".

I also need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included and avoid nested structures. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward. No other lesions are discussed, so no need to worry about multiple entries.

Double-checking the requirements: the JSON should have the three fields with the specified allowed values. Everything seems to fit. No issues with the sample type, malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason is properly formatted. All set!

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
