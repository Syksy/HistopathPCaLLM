Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." The Finnish word "ruumiinavaus" translates to autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the sample is from an autopsy, none of the allowed types match. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, presence of malignant findings. The summary states "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa" which translates to possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. However, the report says current samples are limited and more tests are needed. It doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspects it. So the presence isn't confirmed. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since it's uncertain, maybe NA is appropriate here. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The report mentions seeing various cell growth types, some atrophy and inflammation, but no definitive conclusions due to inflammation and age-related changes. The summary suggests possible malignancy but isn't certain. Since the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "ei" (no) because the current samples don't show confirmed malignancy, only suspicion. Or does "mahdollisen" (possible) count as a malignant finding? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then it's "ei". But the summary says "nykyiset näytteet ovat vain rajallisesti käytettävissä mahdollisen adenokarsinooman... arviointiin", meaning they can't assess properly. So the presence is not confirmed, hence "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. 

So the structured data would be:
1. NA (sample from autopsy, not biopsy/RP/TURP)
2. ei (no confirmed malignancy)
3. NA (no malignancy, so no Gleason)
