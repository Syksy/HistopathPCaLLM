Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." Ruumiinavaus translates to autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection), or NA. Autopsy isn't listed, so the original type would be NA.

Next, malignancy. The summary says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa." The key word here is "mahdollisen," which means possible. The report isn't confirming malignancy, just that further tests are needed. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so the answer should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the current samples are insufficient to confirm malignancy, and the findings mention inflammation and age-related changes but no definitive malignancy, the answer should be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy in the sample. Or does "mahdollisen" imply suspicion but not confirmed? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to limited samples, maybe the answer is "ei" because the existing sample doesn't have malignant findings. The report says "nykyiset näytteet ovat vain rajallisesti käytettävissä" for assessing possible malignancy, so current samples don't show malignancy, hence "ei."

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason would be NA. Even if there was a suspicion, if it's not confirmed, Gleason remains NA. So the answer is NA for that.

So putting it all together: original type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
