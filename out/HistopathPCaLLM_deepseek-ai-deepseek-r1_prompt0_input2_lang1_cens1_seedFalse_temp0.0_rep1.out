Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The input is a free-text medical report in Finnish, and I need to output three specific fields in JSON format. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the three fields to extract are:
1. Original sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA)
2. Presence of malignant findings (kyllä, ei, NA)
3. Gleason grade reported in "major+minor=sum" format or NA if benign.

Looking at the provided example, the answer was for a TURP sample with malignancy and Gleason 3+3=6. Now, I need to apply the same logic to the new input. Wait, the user hasn't provided the actual lausunto (report) yet. Oh, right, maybe the user will provide it after, but in this case, the assistant's example had a specific report. Since the current query is the setup, perhaps the actual report is missing here. Wait, looking back, the user's message ends with "Sovella yllä olevia kysymyksiä tähän seuraavaan lausuntoon:" but then there's no report. That might be an error. But in the example given, the assistant processed a report. Maybe the user intended to include a report but forgot. Alternatively, perhaps this is a test to see if I can handle missing data. Hmm, but the user's instruction says "Raakadata annetaan näiden ohjeiden lopuksi." So the raw data should be at the end of the instructions. Let me check again.

Wait, the user's original message in Finnish says that the raw data is given after the instructions. But in the current query, after the instructions, the user wrote "Sovella..." and then there's no data. That must be a mistake. However, in the example interaction, the user provided a report like "Lausunto: ..." and the assistant processed it. So perhaps in this case, the actual report is missing. But without the report, I can't process anything. Maybe this is a test case where the report is missing, and I should respond accordingly? Or maybe it's an oversight. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include a report here but forgot. Since the task is to process the given report, but it's missing, I can't proceed. However, looking at the example, maybe the user is expecting me to process a hypothetical report. Wait, no. The example shows that when the user provided a report, the assistant processed it. Here, the user's message ends with the instruction to apply the questions to the following statement, but the statement is missing. 

In this case, perhaps the user made a mistake and the report is missing. But since I can't proceed without the actual text, I should inform the user. However, since this is a structured response, maybe the user expects a response even if the data is missing. But according to the problem statement, the raw data is provided at the end of the instructions. So perhaps in the actual scenario, the data is present. Wait, maybe the user's message was cut off. Let me check again.

The user's message ends with: "Sovella yllä olevia kysymyksiä tähän seuraavaan lausuntoon: " and then nothing. So the lausunto (report) is missing. Therefore, I can't extract any information. But the example provided by the assistant had a specific report. Maybe this is a test case where the report is missing, and the correct answer is to return NA for all fields. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include a report but it's not here. 

Given that, the appropriate response would be to return all fields as "NA" since there's no data to process. However, the problem statement says that the raw data is given after the instructions. So perhaps there's a technical error here. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to provide the report in Finnish but it's missing. 

In the absence of the actual report, I can't accurately fill in the fields. Therefore, the correct JSON response would be:

{
  "alkuperainen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuiset_loydot": "NA",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}

But I need to confirm if this is the case. Since the user didn't provide the report, the answer should be all NAs. However, in the example given, the assistant processed a specific report. So perhaps in this case, the user intended to include a report but it's missing. Therefore, the correct approach is to inform the user of the missing data. But since the task requires a JSON response, maybe the expected answer is to return NAs. 

Alternatively, maybe the user included the report in Finnish but it's not visible here due to formatting. Let me check again. The user's message ends with "seuraavaan lausuntoon: " and then nothing. So the report is missing. Therefore, the only possible answer is to return all NAs. 

But wait, perhaps the user's original input had the report, but in the context provided here, it's missing. For example, in a real scenario, the user would have pasted the report after the instructions. But in this case, it's missing. Therefore, the correct answer is to return NAs. 

So, the final JSON would be as above. But I need to make sure that the structure is correct, with the three fields and allowed values. Since there's no data, all are NA.

{
  "alkuperainen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuiset_loydot": "NA",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}

*Huom: Koska tehtävänannossa ei ollut varsinaista histopatologista lausuntotekstiä käsiteltäväksi, kaikki kentät palautetaan arvolla "NA". Oikeassa käyttötapauksessa raakateksti analysoitaisiin ja arvot päätettäisiin sen sisällön perusteella.*
