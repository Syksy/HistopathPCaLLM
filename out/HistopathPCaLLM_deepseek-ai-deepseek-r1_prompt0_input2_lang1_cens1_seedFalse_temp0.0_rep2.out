Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided report, the first line mentions "Prostatanäyte TURP." TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, so the sample type here is TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The report states "Pahanlaatuisia muutoksia: on." The word "on" means "yes" in Finnish, so the answer here is "kyllä."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The report says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7." So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. However, the user specified that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. If there are multiple lesions, we take the highest Gleason. But in this case, there's only one mentioned: Gleason 4+3=7. So that's the one to report. 

Wait, the report also mentions "lisäksi on paikoin Gleason 3 + 3 = 6." But the instruction says to take the pahimman leesion, which is the worst one. So between 4+3=7 and 3+3=6, the worst is 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be 4+3=7. 

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures. Each field is a top-level key. Also, check that the values are exactly as per allowed options. For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum" as a string. So the final JSON should have those three keys with the correct values.

```json
{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "4+3=7"
}
```
