Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." "Ruumiinavaus" translates to autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Autopsy isn't listed, so the sample type should be NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The summary states "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa" which translates to possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. However, the report says current samples are limited and more tests are needed. Since it's only a possibility and not confirmed, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here is "ei" (no) because there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy.

For the Gleason score, it's required only if malignancy is confirmed. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here, the Gleason grade should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports using NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct without nested structures and using the allowed values.
