Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "Prostatan biopsianäyte." "Biopsianäyte" translates to biopsy sample. So the original type here is biopsy. That should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Löydös: Eturauhasen adenokarsinooma." Adenokarsinooma is adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers or NA if benign. Since malignancy is present, we need to find the Gleason scores. The text says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7." So major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. Therefore, the value is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. The sample type is definitely biopsy. The diagnosis is malignant. Gleason is clearly stated. All seems correct. No other lesions are mentioned, so we take the worst one, which is this case is the only one. So the JSON should be as specified.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "4+3=7"
}
```
