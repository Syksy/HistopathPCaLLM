Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, NA):** The report mentions "TURP-näyte." TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the answer here should be "TURP".

2. **Malignant findings (kyllä, ei, NA):** The text states "ei pahanlaatuisia muutoksia," which translates to "no malignant changes." So the answer is "ei".

3. **Gleason grade (major+minor=sum or NA):** Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So this should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer directly corresponds to the three questions. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "ei pahanlaatuisia" confirms no malignancy. The sample type is clearly TURP. Gleason is NA because there's no cancer. All set.

{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
