Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "Prostatan biopsianäyte." "Biopsianäyte" translates to biopsy sample. So the original type here is biopsy. That should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "adenokarsinooma," which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be major+minor=sum. The text says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7." So that's straightforward. However, the user specified that if there are multiple lesions, only the worst one should be reported. The report mentions "Useita eri alueilta löytyviä pahanlaatuisia rauhasmuutoksia, joista pahin..." which means several malignant changes, with the worst being Gleason 4+3=7. So we take that one. The value should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each key is top-level. Also, check that the sample type is correctly identified as biopsy. The malignancy is definitely present because adenocarcinoma is malignant. Gleason score is clearly given. No issues here. All right, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "4+3=7"
}
