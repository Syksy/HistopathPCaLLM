Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the samples are mentioned as "chippings near the urothelial cells." Chippings are typically associated with TURP procedures, so I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The report mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the key is to find the primary and secondary patterns. The text states "diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." However, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. The main grades here are 4 (primary) and 3 (secondary), summing to 7. Even though there's a tertiary grade 5, the standard Gleason scoring uses the two highest grades. But the report also mentions updating the diagnosis from 3+3 to a higher grade. The final Grade Group 3 corresponds to a Gleason score of 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 4+3=7. That seems right.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
