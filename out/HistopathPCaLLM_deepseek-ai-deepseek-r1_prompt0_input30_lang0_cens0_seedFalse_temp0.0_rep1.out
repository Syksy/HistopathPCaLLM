Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" is commonly associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is chipped away. So I think the original sample type here is TURP.

Next, determining if there are malignant tumor findings. The report mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" which is a malignant tumor. Even though there were some uncertainties and artifacts, the final diagnosis confirms malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the user prefers the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text states "diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." However, the Gleason score is typically the sum of the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. Tertiary grades are noted but not included in the sum. So primary is 4, secondary is 3, sum is 7. The mention of the prior diagnosis being 3+3 and updated to Grade Group 3 (which corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7) supports this. So the reported Gleason grade should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The tertiary grade 5 might indicate a more aggressive component, but according to current guidelines, the primary and secondary are the main components for the score. The tertiary is noted but doesn't change the sum. So the main Gleason remains 4+3=7.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 4+3=7. Let me double-check the terms. "Chippings" does point to TURP. The diagnosis confirms adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. The Gleason is correctly summed from primary and secondary. Tertiary is mentioned but not part of the sum. Yep, that's right.
