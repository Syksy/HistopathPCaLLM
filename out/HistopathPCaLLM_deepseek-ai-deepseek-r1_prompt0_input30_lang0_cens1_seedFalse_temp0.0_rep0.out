Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text medical report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions it's an appendix and additional consultation. There's no mention of how the sample was obtained—like biopsy, surgery, or TURP procedure. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says there were atypical findings suspected but the consultants couldn't confirm or deny. The diagnosis was uncertain and requires further examination. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and the initial suspicion wasn't validated, the answer here should be "no" because the presence of a malignant tumor isn't confirmed. Wait, but the options are yes, no, or NA. If the report is uncertain, maybe "NA" is more appropriate? Let me think. The key is whether there's a definite yes or no. Since they couldn't confirm or deny, it's ambiguous. However, the instructions say to return "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report doesn't state a clear malignancy, but mentions uncertainty, maybe "no" isn't right. Alternatively, "NA" might be used when the information isn't available or applicable. But the question is about whether there were malignant findings. If the suspicion was there but unconfirmed, does that count as "no" or "NA"? The original uncertain diagnosis couldn't be determined, so maybe "NA" is better here because the presence isn't confirmed. So I'll go with "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (we put "NA" for the second field), the Gleason grade should also be "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason scores in the text, which supports this.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA
3. Gleason grade: NA
