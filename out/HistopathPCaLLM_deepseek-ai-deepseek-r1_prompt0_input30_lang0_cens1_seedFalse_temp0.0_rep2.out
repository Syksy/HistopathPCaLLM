Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, there's no mention of any specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about a consultation and uncertain findings, but not the sample type. So the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "atypical findings were suspected" but the consultants couldn't confirm or deny. Since there's uncertainty and no confirmation, it's not a clear yes or no. The instructions say to use NA if it's uncertain or not determined. So here, NA is appropriate.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum as numbers if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the findings are uncertain, there's no Gleason grade reported. So again, NA.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but the text doesn't mention multiple lesions. The key points are the uncertainties and lack of confirmation. All three fields should be NA in this case. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting. Let me double-check the allowed values and the text to confirm. Yep, no sample type mentioned, malignancy uncertain, no Gleason grade. All set.
