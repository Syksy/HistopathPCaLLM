Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the mention is about "lastuista" which translates to "chips" in Finnish. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP. The original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy or RP, so TURP fits.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" which means malignant findings. The report talks about updating the diagnosis to "keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi" (moderate adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the key part is "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and there's a tertiary 5. But according to guidelines, if there's a tertiary higher grade, some systems consider the highest grades. However, the user instructions say to take the worst lesion and present as major+minor=sum. The main components here are 4 and 3, but there's a tertiary 5. Wait, but the problem states to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. Tertiary patterns can complicate things. However, the example given in the text updates the Gleason score from 3+3=6 (GG1) to now Grade Group 3. Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7 or 3+4=7 with tertiary 5. Wait, the text says "luokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So primary 4, secondary 3, tertiary 5. In such cases, the Gleason score is reported as 4 + 5 = 9? But the Grade Group here is mentioned as 3. Grade Group 3 is typically 4+3=7. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, the text says the previous diagnosis was 3+3 (GG1) and now it's updated to Grade Group 3. Grade Group 3 is Gleason 4+3=7. But the mention of tertiary 5 might be complicating. However, the user instructions say to report the major and minor components as sum, and only the worst lesion. So perhaps the tertiary 5 is not included in the sum but the major and minor are 4 and 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. But the presence of tertiary 5 might mean that the actual score is 4+5=9, but the Grade Group here is 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. The text says "nyt siis Grade Group 3", which aligns with 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be 4+3=7. The tertiary 5 might be noted but not included in the sum for the purposes of this structure. So the answer is "4+3=7".
