Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, there's mention of "lastuista" which translates to "chips" in Finnish. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically yields chip-like samples, so I think the sample type here is TURP. The original report doesn't mention biopsy or RP (radical prostatectomy), so TURP makes sense.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "päivitetään keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi" which translates to "upgraded to intermediate adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and there's a tertiary 5. However, according to Gleason grading rules, if there's a tertiary higher grade (like 5 here), it's included in the score. But the user instructions specify to report the major and minor, summing them. The main components are 4 and 3, so 4+3=7. The tertiary 5 might not be part of the main sum but is noted in the report. However, the user wants only the pahimman (worst) lesion's results. The original diagnosis was 3+3, now updated to 4+3 with tertiary 5. But the main sum is 4+3=7. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but sometimes tertiary patterns are considered. For example, if there's a tertiary 5, some systems report it as the highest grade plus the next highest. But the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results) and "major+minor=sum". The example given in the text is "major+minor=sum" as integers. The report mentions "vallitseva" (dominant) 4 and 3, with tertiary 5. But the main components are 4 and 3. However, in some cases, tertiary grades are included if they are higher. For instance, if the patterns are 4, 3, and 5, the Gleason score could be 4+5=9, but that's only if the tertiary is a significant component. But the text says "tertiäärinen 5", which is a tertiary component. According to current guidelines, the primary and secondary patterns are the two most common, and tertiary is the next highest. But the sum is primary + secondary. However, if there's a tertiary higher grade, some systems might adjust. But the user's instruction says to take the worst lesion's results. The original diagnosis was 3+3, now updated to 4+3 with tertiary 5. The main components here are 4 and 3, sum 7. The tertiary 5 might be noted but not added to the sum. So the correct Gleason here would be 4+3=7. But wait, the text says "Grade Group 3", which corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7. Grade Group 3 is indeed Gleason 4+3=7. So the answer should be "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. Let me double-check each part. The sample type: "lastuista" refers to TURP chips. Malignancy: adenocarcinoma is malignant. Gleason: the main components are 4 and 3, sum 7, and the tertiary 5 is mentioned but not part of the sum here. The report also states Grade Group 3, which aligns with 4+3=7. So the JSON should reflect these values.
