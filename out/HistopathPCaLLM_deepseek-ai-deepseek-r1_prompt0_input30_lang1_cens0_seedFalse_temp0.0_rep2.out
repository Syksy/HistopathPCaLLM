Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, there's mention of "lastuista" which translates to "chips" in Finnish, commonly associated with TURP procedures. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "päivitetään keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi" which means upgraded to intermediate adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the key part is "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and tertiary 5. But according to Gleason scoring rules, if there's a tertiary pattern, the score is the primary plus the highest of the secondary/tertiary. However, the user instructions specify "pahimman leesion" (worst lesion) and format as "major+minor=sum". Here, the main components are 4 and 3, sum 7. The tertiary 5 might not be included in the sum but is noted. So the Gleason should be 4+3=7. 

Wait, but sometimes when there's a tertiary grade, especially in biopsies, it's handled differently. However, the user says to take the worst lesion's results. The primary is 4, secondary 3, and tertiary 5. But the sum is primary + highest of the remaining. So 4 + 5 =9? But the text says the previous was 3+3, now updated to Grade Group 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. Grade Group 3 is Gleason 4+3. So the correct sum here is 4+3=7. The tertiary 5 might be mentioned but not added into the sum for the primary reporting. So the answer is 4+3=7.
