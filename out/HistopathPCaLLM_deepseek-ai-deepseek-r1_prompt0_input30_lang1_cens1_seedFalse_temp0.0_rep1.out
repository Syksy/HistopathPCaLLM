Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text, there's mention of "kudosnäytteen" which translates to "tissue sample" in Finnish. However, the specific type like biopsy, RP, or TURP isn't explicitly stated. So the answer here should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions that the original suspicions of abnormal findings couldn't be confirmed or ruled out by the consultants (MM & MM). The patient's previous diagnosis was uncertain, and further tests are needed. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the presence of malignant findings should be "ei" (no), but wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". However, the report states that the initial suspicions were uncertain and not confirmed. So technically, the presence isn't confirmed, but the question is whether there were any malignant findings in the sample. Since they couldn't confirm, it's possible that the sample doesn't have definitive malignant cells. But the answer options might require "ei" if no malignancy is found, or "NA" if it's uncertain. However, the user instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results and that for benign findings, Gleason is "NA". The text says the previous diagnosis was uncertain and couldn't be determined, so maybe the presence here is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, if the sample is inconclusive, maybe "NA". But the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample's findings are uncertain and not confirmed, perhaps "NA" is more appropriate here. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the consultants couldn't confirm or rule out, then it's uncertain. But the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So in this case, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" is not correct. But the original suspicion was there, but not confirmed. The answer might be "ei" if the sample doesn't show malignancy, but the text says they couldn't confirm. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the sample itself has malignant findings. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then the answer would be "ei". But if the report is inconclusive, maybe "NA". However, the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample's analysis is inconclusive, then technically, the presence is not determined, so "NA". But the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if the sample's result is uncertain, "NA" would be appropriate here. 

Third, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to report it as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain (or "ei" if we go with that), the Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is "NA" because it's not specified. Malignant findings are "NA" because the result is inconclusive. Gleason is "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy.
