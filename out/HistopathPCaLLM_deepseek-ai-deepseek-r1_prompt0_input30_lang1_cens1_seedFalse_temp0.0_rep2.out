Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report from prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the instructions again to make sure I understand all the requirements.

First, the three fields are: 
1. Sample's original type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). 
2. Presence of malignant findings (yes, no, NA). 
3. Reported Gleason grade in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else NA.

The input text is a consultation note. Let me read the provided text carefully.

The text mentions "kudosnäytteen tulkinta haastavaa" which translates to "interpretation of the tissue sample is challenging". There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the first field should be NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says there were suspicious findings initially, but the consultants couldn't confirm or reject the suspicions. The previous diagnosis was uncertain, and further tests are needed. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here would be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, or maybe "NA" if uncertainty is considered. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that they couldn't confirm or reject the suspicions, so it's unclear. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since it's uncertain, maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed, but the original suspicion was there. Hmm. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample didn't confirm malignancy, even if there were suspicions, the answer would be "ei". Alternatively, if the sample is inconclusive, maybe "NA". But the allowed values are only yes, no, or NA. The report says they couldn't confirm or reject, so perhaps the presence is not determined, hence "NA". Wait, but the third field's Gleason grade is NA if benign. If the malignancy is uncertain, maybe the second field is NA. But the options for the second field are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Let me check the original text again. The original sample's interpretation was challenging due to age-related changes. The previous uncertain diagnosis couldn't be determined, and status requires further testing. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so the answer here would be "ei" (no) because the sample didn't show confirmed malignancy. Or maybe "NA" because it's inconclusive. The problem is that the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample is inconclusive, then maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the options for the second field are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample didn't confirm malignancy, but there were suspicions, but the consultants couldn't confirm, perhaps the answer is "ei" because the conclusion is that malignancy wasn't found. Alternatively, if the sample is inconclusive, then "NA". The key is whether the report states that there are malignant findings. Since the report says they couldn't confirm or reject, it's unclear. So maybe "NA" is the correct answer here. But I need to be careful. The third field is Gleason grade, which is NA if benign. If the second field is "ei", then Gleason is NA. If the second field is "kyllä", then Gleason is required. But in this case, since the malignancy isn't confirmed, the second field should be "ei" or "NA". The user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). But in this case, there's no clear worst lesion. So perhaps the second field is "ei" because no malignancy was confirmed. But the original suspicion was there. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The presence of malignant findings: the sample didn't confirm any, so the answer is "ei". The third field would then be NA. 

Third field: Gleason grade. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, it's NA.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (not mentioned)
2. Malignant findings: "ei" (since not confirmed)
3. Gleason: NA

Wait, but the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (results of the worst lesion). If there's no confirmed lesion, then the worst is non-malignant. So the second field is "ei", third is NA. 

Yes, that makes sense. The sample type isn't mentioned, so NA. Malignant findings are not confirmed, so "ei". Gleason is NA.
