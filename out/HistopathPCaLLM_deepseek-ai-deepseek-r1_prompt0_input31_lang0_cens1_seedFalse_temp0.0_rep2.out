Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "after imaging necessary samples were taken. A clear technical failure in the first sample. Other samples contain suspicious findings..." The term "samples were taken" suggests a biopsy, as that's a common method for obtaining tissue samples. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "suspicious findings" in the samples. However, it also says interpretation was difficult and additional samples are needed. "Suspicious" might indicate malignancy, but it's not confirmed. The report doesn't definitively state malignancy, so maybe the answer here is "NA" because it's uncertain. But the user said to take the most severe lesion. The suspicious findings are present, but they only make up 5% of the samples. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "NA" is safer than "yes". Alternatively, if suspicious implies malignancy, then "yes". But in medical terms, suspicious might not be a definitive diagnosis. The user might consider "suspicious" as malignant, but I need to be cautious. The answer here is tricky. Let me check again. The statement says "suspicious findings" but also mentions interpretation was difficult. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignant finding is uncertain (NA in the previous field), the Gleason grade would also be "NA". Even if there were suspicious findings, without a confirmed Gleason score, it can't be reported. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant is NA, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of TURP or RP. The samples taken are likely biopsy. The malignant part is unclear but since it's not confirmed, NA. Gleason not mentioned, so NA.
