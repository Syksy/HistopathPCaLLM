Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish medical report related to prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy, so that's a biopsy. Then later, there's "targetoitua biopsiaa" (targeted biopsy), so the samples are biopsies. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So the answer here should be "biopsy".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The report talks about "3+3=6 Gleason" which is cancerous, and later mentions "kasvutapaa 4" and "kasvutapa 5", both of which are higher grades. So definitely malignant. The answer is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the highest reported. The initial was 3+3=6, but the targeted biopsy found mainly pattern 4 and the second most common pattern 5. So the major is 4, minor is 5, sum 9. The answer should be "4+5=9".

Wait, the instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. The text says "pahimman laatuisiin fokuksiin" which implies the worst was not sampled initially. The new biopsy shows major 4 and second most is 5, so the sum is 4+5=9. So the Gleason should be 4+5=9. Need to confirm that the highest is correctly identified here. The text says "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (mainly pattern 4) and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common 5). So major is 4, minor 5, sum 9. Yes, that's correct.
