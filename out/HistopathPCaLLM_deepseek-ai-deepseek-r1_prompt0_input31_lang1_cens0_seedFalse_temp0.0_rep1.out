Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy, so that's a biopsy. Then later, "targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning targeted biopsy. But the instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. The original sample here is biopsy, so the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, whether there's malignancy. The text has "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" which means malignant findings. The first biopsy found 3+3=6, which is malignant. The second biopsy found grade 4 and 5, which are worse. So definitely "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the worst is mentioned as "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (mainly pattern 4) and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common pattern 5). So major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. The format is major+minor=sum, so "4+5=9".

Wait, but the original Gleason 6 was from the first biopsy, but the worst is from the second. The answer should reflect the worst lesion, which is 4+5=9. So the Gleason here is 4+5=9. The user specified to take the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So the answer for the third field is "4+5=9".

Check the allowed values: sample type is biopsy, malignancy yes, Gleason sum as major+minor=sum. No nested structures. All set.
