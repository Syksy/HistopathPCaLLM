Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the patient had a "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies. So the sample type is biopsy.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The report mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). The first biopsy had a minimal focus of 3+3=6, which is cancer. The second biopsy found a larger focus with growth patterns 4 and 5. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report the worst lesion as major+minor=sum. The first biopsy was 3+3=6, but the second one mentions "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (mainly growth pattern 4) and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common pattern 5). So the major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. The latest finding is the worst, so Gleason 4+5=9. The answer should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the user said to take the worst lesion's result. The first was 3+3=6, but the second is 4+5=9. So the worst is 4+5=9. So the Gleason is 4+5=9. Got it.
