Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the patient had imaging done and then "otettiin tarvittavat näytteet" (took necessary samples). The first sample had a technical failure, and others were taken. The term "näytteestä" (from the sample) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of RP or TURP. Since it's about taking samples, likely a biopsy. But the text isn't explicit. However, in medical contexts, when they take samples after imaging without specifying surgery, it's usually a biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, presence of malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" (suspicious findings) in other samples, covering 5% of the sample. But it's noted that the interpretation is difficult, requiring more samples. The term "pahanlaatuisia" (malignant) isn't explicitly used. The suspicious findings might not be confirmed as malignant yet. The report says it's unclear if other treatments caused the abnormalities. So, since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or NA. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If they only have suspicious findings but not confirmed malignancy, then the answer would be "ei" because it's not confirmed. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because the presence isn't confirmed. Alternatively, if "epäilyttäviä" is considered as possible malignancy, but the report says they need more samples. The key is whether the report states malignancy. Since it's not explicitly stated, perhaps the answer is "ei". But I need to be careful. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the suspicious findings are the worst, but not confirmed, maybe it's still "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. Even if there were suspicious findings, if they aren't confirmed as malignant, Gleason isn't reported. So the answer here is "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA
