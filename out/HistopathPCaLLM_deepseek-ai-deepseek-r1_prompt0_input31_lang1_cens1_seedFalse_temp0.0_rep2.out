Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions that after imaging, "otettiin tarvittavat näytteet" (the necessary samples were taken). The first sample had a technical failure, and others had suspicious findings. The term "näytteet" (samples) here is plural, but the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. Common prostate samples are biopsies, TURP (transurethral resection), or RP (radical prostatectomy). Since the patient is undergoing initial checks and there's mention of needing more samples, it's likely a biopsy. But the text doesn't specify, so maybe "NA" is safer. Wait, but the first sample had a technical failure, and others had 5% coverage. Biopsy is more probable here. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the type, so maybe "NA" is correct. Hmm, but sometimes in medical contexts, if they mention taking samples after imaging, it's usually a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly stated, perhaps "NA" is the answer here. I'll note that.

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" (suspicious findings) in the samples, covering 5%. However, it's mentioned that the tissue interpretation is difficult and requires more samples. The term "epäilyttäviä" could be suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspicious. So the answer here would be "ei" because malignancy isn't confirmed, or "NA"? Wait, the question is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they are only suspicious and not confirmed, then it's not malignant yet. So the answer would be "ei". But the user might consider "epäilyttäviä" as possible malignancy. But according to the instructions, only confirmed malignancies should be considered. Since it's not confirmed and requires more samples, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the findings are suspicious but not confirmed malignant, and the malignancy answer is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type isn't explicitly stated, so "NA"; malignancy is "ei"; Gleason "NA".
