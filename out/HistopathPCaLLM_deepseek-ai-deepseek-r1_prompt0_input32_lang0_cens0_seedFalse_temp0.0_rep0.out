Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "the patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." So RP is the answer here. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states there's an "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which is a malignant tumor. Even though the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear (benign), the primary site (prostate) has malignancy. So the answer should be yes.

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the most severe lesion's grade in major+minor=sum format. The text lists several patterns: 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The highest Gleason score here is 4+4=8. Since we need the most severe, it's 4+4=8. Even though other patterns are present, the highest is the one to report.

Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Check each field again. Original sample type is RP. Malignant is yes. Gleason is "4+4=8". All correct. No issues here.
