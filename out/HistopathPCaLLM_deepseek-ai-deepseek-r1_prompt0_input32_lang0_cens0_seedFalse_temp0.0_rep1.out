Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "the patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." So RP should be the answer here. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states that in the original multifocal adenocarcinoma, various Gleason patterns were observed (4+4, 3+3, etc.), which indicates malignancy. However, later it says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, and the findings there are benign. But the key point is that the most severe lesion should be considered. The adenocarcinoma with Gleason 4+4 is the primary tumor, so malignant findings are present. So the answer here is yes.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The highest grade mentioned is 4+4=8. Even though there are other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, etc., the most severe is 4+4. So the answer is "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and there's no nesting. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. Original sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. That should cover it.
