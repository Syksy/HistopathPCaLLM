Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "the patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." So RP is the answer here. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states there's an "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which is a malignant tumor. Even though the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear (benign), the primary site still has cancer. So the answer should be yes.

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the most severe lesion's grade in major+minor=sum format. The text lists several patterns: 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The highest Gleason score here is 4+4=8. Since the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, 4+4=8 is the correct entry. Even though other patterns are present, the highest one is what's needed.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me check each part again. Original sample type is RP. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 4+4=8. All values fit the allowed options. The answer should be a JSON object with these three key-value pairs.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
