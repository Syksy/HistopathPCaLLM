Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as being from different locations, but the primary tissue is prostate. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The statement says "samples are from different batches" and "original primary prostate tissue," but without a specific procedure noted. So maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. If those are clear, does that mean no malignancy found? But wait, the primary prostate tissue findings "remain," but the summary doesn't state any tumor. Since there's no mention of malignancy in the samples, maybe the answer is "no" for malignant findings. But I need to be careful. If the primary tissue wasn't mentioned as having tumors, and the other areas are clear, then likely "no."

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no," the Gleason grade would be NA. If there's no tumor, there's no Gleason score to report.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignant is "no" because no tumors are mentioned. Gleason is NA accordingly. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Let me double-check the text again. The samples are from different locations, but the primary prostate tissue findings "remain" – unclear if that implies malignancy. However, the summary states lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, which might suggest no spread, but the primary could still have cancer. Wait, but the user said to take the most severe lesion. If the primary isn't mentioned as having cancer, and other areas are clear, then maybe the answer is "no" for malignancy. Hmm, tricky. But since the user specified to take the most severe lesion, and there's no mention of malignancy in any sample, including the primary, then "no" is correct. So the final JSON should have NA, no, NA.
