Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as being from different locations, but the primary tissue is prostate. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The statement says "samples are from different batches" and "original primary prostate tissue," but without a specific procedure noted. So maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. If those are clear, does that mean no malignancy found? But wait, the primary prostate tissue findings "remain," but the summary doesn't state any tumor. Since there's no mention of malignancy in the samples, maybe the answer is "no" for malignant findings. But I need to be careful. Sometimes "clear" lymph nodes might mean no spread, but the primary could still have cancer. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention any tumor in the primary either. So perhaps "no" or NA? The user instructions say to use NA if not available. Since there's no direct mention of malignancy, maybe "NA" is safer. Wait, but the user says "malignant tumor findings" – if the report doesn't mention any, maybe it's "no"? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, but the primary prostate findings "remain." If the original sections (from primary) were malignant, but the update doesn't mention it, maybe the answer is "yes"? Wait, the original problem is that the user provided an update. The original primary prostate tissue findings remain, but the update doesn't specify what those findings were. So if the original had malignancy, but the update doesn't change that, but the current text is the update. Wait, the user's input is the entire statement, which includes the update. The statement says "the findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain." So maybe the original findings are still present, but the text doesn't say what they were. So we can't determine malignancy from this. Therefore, the answer here would be "NA" because there's no explicit mention of malignancy in the current statement. The user might have intended that if there's no mention, default to NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The answer should be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else NA. Since we determined malignant findings as NA, the Gleason grade would be NA. But if the malignant finding was "no," then Gleason would be NA. Either way, in this case, since there's no mention of Gleason score, it's NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. But wait, the user said to take the most severe lesion. However, the text doesn't mention any lesions. The samples are from different locations with different results, but the summary only states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear. The primary prostate findings remain, but no details. So perhaps there's no lesion reported here. Therefore, all answers would be NA.
