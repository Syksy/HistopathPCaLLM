Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana..." which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined..." So the original sample type here is RP.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report mentions "Alkuperäisestä multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta..." which means "original multifocal adenocarcinoma..." indicating malignancy. However, the additional lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined (samples 1,2,3,4) are clean. But the question is about the presence of malignant findings in the sample. The original prostate sample had cancer, but the new samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign. Wait, the instructions say to consider the worst lesion's results. The original primary tumor had Gleason 4+4, which is malignant. So even though the new samples are clean, the overall report still has malignant findings. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the Gleason grade. The text lists "gleason 4+4 tason kasvua, myös 3+3, 3+4 ja 4+3." The worst here is 4+4=8. So the major and minor are both 4, sum 8. So the format should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the instructions say to report the worst lesion's Gleason. The original sample had 4+4, which is the highest mentioned. The other samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, but the primary tumor's Gleason is the key here. So the answer is 4+4=8.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type is RP.
2. Malignant findings: yes.
3. Gleason: 4+4=8.
