Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana..." which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined..." So the original sample type here is RP. Even though later they took lymph nodes and other samples, the primary sample was RP.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The report mentions that the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) and seminal vesicles (samples 3 and 4) are clean, with no malignancy. However, the original prostate sample had multifocal adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores. The key here is that the current samples (1-4) are benign, but the original tumor is still present. The question is about the current sample's malignancy. Since the samples processed now (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are clean, the answer should be "ei" (no). But wait, the original tumor is still noted. The instructions say to consider the worst lesion's results. However, the samples being processed now (the ones in the report) are the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are benign. The original prostate findings are mentioned but those samples aren't the current ones. So the current samples don't have malignancy. So the answer here is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum. The original tumor had Gleason 4+4, 3+3, etc. But since the current samples (the ones being reported now) are benign, the Gleason would be NA. The instructions specify that Gleason is only for malignant findings. Since the current samples are benign, it's NA. However, the user mentioned to take the worst lesion's results. Wait, the original sample had Gleason 4+4, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are clean. The task says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which I think refers to the worst lesion in the current samples. Since the current samples are benign, there's no Gleason to report. So the answer is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type is RP.
2. Malignant findings in the current samples: ei.
3. Gleason: NA.
