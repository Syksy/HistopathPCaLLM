Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" which translates to "original prostate tissue". However, the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" (samples taken from different locations), which might suggest biopsies, but it's not certain. Since there's no clear indication of the procedure type, the safest answer here is "NA".

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista... jäävät voimaan" which means findings from macroscopic sections remain valid. However, the summary mentions "imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat" (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean). There's no explicit mention of cancer or malignancy. The absence of positive findings in the summary might suggest no malignancy, but the original findings are still valid. Wait, the original question is about whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main prostate samples might have findings. However, the text doesn't clearly state malignancy. The initial part mentions "Tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen" (results vary between samples), but without specifics. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer, carcinoma, or Gleason scores, it's possible that there are no malignant findings. Hence, the answer here might be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since we determined malignancy might be "ei", the Gleason would be "NA". But wait, if there's uncertainty in the malignancy assessment, this could affect the Gleason. However, the report doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. So regardless of the malignancy determination, if Gleason isn't reported, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is ei, Gleason NA. But let me double-check. The original text mentions "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan" which could imply that previous findings (from macroscopic sections of the original prostate tissue) are still valid. If those previous findings included malignancy, but the current samples (like lymph nodes) are clean, then maybe the original sample (prostate) had malignancy. But the current samples (which are from different locations, possibly lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are clean. However, the user is asking about the sample in question. The report is an update, mentioning samples from different locations, and the results vary. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the original prostate findings remain. If the original sample type was, say, a biopsy of the prostate, but the current samples are from other locations, but the user's question is about the sample described in this report. Since the current samples (different locations) have varying results, but the summary says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, which are typically examined in RP specimens. So maybe the sample type here is RP. But the text says "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" (samples taken from different locations), which could be from an RP where multiple sections are taken. If that's the case, the sample type would be RP. But the original text doesn't explicitly state RP. Hmm. The user might expect "RP" if it's a prostatectomy specimen, but without explicit mention, it's safer to stick with NA. 

Regarding malignancy: if the original prostate findings (from previous reports) are still valid, but the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are clean, then the current samples might not have malignancy, hence "ei". But the question is about the sample in this report, not previous ones. The current report's samples (different locations) have varying results, but the summary says they are clean. So "ei" for malignancy. 

Gleason: not mentioned, so NA.
