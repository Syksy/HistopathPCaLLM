Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the mention is "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" which translates to original prostate tissue. The report doesn't specify if it's from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection (TURP). So I should go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat" meaning lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. But earlier it mentions that the findings from the macroscopic sections of the original prostate tissue remain valid. However, there's no explicit mention of cancer. The samples vary, but the summary doesn't indicate malignancy. So maybe "ei" (no) or is there any hint of cancer? Wait, the initial part says "PÄIVITYS: Potilaan näytteet eri erissä" which is an update, and the results differ between samples. But the conclusion is that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. Without explicit mention of carcinoma or malignancy, it's safer to say "ei" unless stated otherwise. But I need to be careful. The original prostate tissue findings are mentioned, but if they were malignant, it would probably say. Since the summary doesn't report cancer, maybe "ei". But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the original samples had cancer but the update says they are clean? Hmm. The text is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether there are malignant findings. If the original prostate tissue had findings that remain valid, but the current samples (like lymph nodes) are clean. But the question is about the sample in the report. The report's conclusion is that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the original prostate tissue findings are still valid. If the original was malignant, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are not, then the presence of malignancy in the sample would depend on which sample is being referred to. However, the user wants the worst lesion's results. Wait, the instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – so only the worst lesion's results. If the original prostate tissue had cancer (assuming that's the worst), but the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are clean, then the presence of malignancy would be "kyllä". But the text isn't clear. The original report's findings (from prostate tissue) remain valid, but the current samples (different locations) have varying results. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. If the original prostate tissue had cancer, then the answer would be "kyllä", but if the original was benign, then "ei". The problem is the original text doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The term "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" requires evidence of malignancy. Since the report doesn't mention carcinoma, Gleason score, or other malignant terms, maybe the answer is "ei". But I'm uncertain. Let me check again. The original prostate tissue's macroscopic sections' findings remain valid. If those findings were malignant, then yes. But without knowing what those findings were, can we assume? The user might expect that if malignancy isn't mentioned, it's "ei". But the presence of "löydökset" (findings) in the original prostate tissue could be benign or malignant. Since the summary says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the original prostate findings are still valid, but without explicit mention of cancer, perhaps the answer is "ei". Alternatively, maybe "NA" if it's unclear. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. If there's no malignancy, it's NA. If we answered "ei" for the second question, then Gleason is NA. If we answered "kyllä", then we need to find the Gleason score. The text doesn't mention Gleason, so regardless, it's NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no explicit mention)
3. Gleason: NA
