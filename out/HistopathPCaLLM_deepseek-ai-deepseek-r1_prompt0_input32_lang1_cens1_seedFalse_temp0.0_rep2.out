Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta". The term "prostatakudoksesta" translates to prostate tissue. The report doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't clearly stated.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions that the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) and seminal vesicles (seminaalivesikkelit) are clean (puhtaat). However, the main focus is on the prostate tissue. The text doesn't explicitly state the presence of cancer. It says the results vary between samples but doesn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of cancer, maybe the answer here is "ei" (no) or possibly NA. Wait, but the user said to consider the worst lesion. If some samples had findings but others didn't, but the worst is benign, then "ei". But the text says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." The term "jäävät voimaan" means remain valid. If the original findings were malignant, but the update says lymph nodes are clean, maybe the prostate itself had cancer. Wait, but the original report's findings are maintained. However, the user's instruction is to take the worst lesion. If the original prostate tissue had cancer, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet etc.) are clean, then the malignancy would still be present. But the text isn't clear. The original report's findings are valid, but the current samples (from different locations) have varying results. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but what about the prostate samples? The text is a bit ambiguous. Since the user wants the worst lesion, but if the current samples don't show malignancy, maybe the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if the original prostate had cancer, but the new samples are varying, perhaps the malignancy is present. Hmm. This is tricky. The report is an update, and the original findings from the prostate remain valid. If the original findings were malignant, then "kyllä". But the text doesn't explicitly state that. The user might expect "kyllä" if the original had cancer, but since the current samples are from different locations and vary, but the original prostate findings are still valid. Wait, the original sample's findings (from prostate tissue) remain valid. If the original was malignant, then malignancy is present. But the text doesn't say if the original was malignant. The user's example might have the answer as "kyllä" if the original had cancer, but without explicit mention, maybe NA. But the question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the sample. If the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, but the prostate's original findings are valid, but we don't know if those original findings were malignant. The text doesn't state cancer, so maybe "ei" or NA. But the user might expect "kyllä" if the original was cancer. This is unclear. Since the original report's findings are maintained, but the text doesn't specify malignancy, perhaps the answer is NA. Alternatively, if the original was a cancer case, but the current samples are clean, but the original is still valid, then malignancy is present. But without explicit info, maybe NA. Hmm. The user's instructions say to consider the worst lesion. If the original prostate had cancer (as per the original report), then malignancy is present. But the current text doesn't mention cancer, only that the original findings are valid. So maybe the answer is "kyllä". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the original findings were benign, then "ei". But the text doesn't specify. This is a problem. Since the user's example might require "NA" if not enough info, but the presence is required. Wait, the question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the sample. The samples mentioned here are from different locations, and the results vary. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the original prostate findings remain. If the original prostate had cancer, then the answer is "kyllä". But if the original was benign, then "ei". Since the text doesn't specify, maybe NA. But the user might expect "kyllä" if the original was cancer. But how do we know? The text doesn't state the original findings. It just says the original findings remain valid. So perhaps the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the original sample type was a biopsy, but that's not stated. 

Third, Gleason grade. If there's malignancy, it should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If no malignancy, then NA. If the presence is "ei" or NA, then Gleason is NA. 

Putting it all together: 

1. Alkuperäinen tyyppi: NA (since the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Pahanlaatuisia: NA (since it's unclear if the original findings were malignant)
3. Gleason: NA

But maybe the presence is "ei" because the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, implying no malignancy. But the original prostate findings are still valid. If the original had cancer, then presence is "kyllä". But without knowing, perhaps the answer is NA. 

Alternatively, since the samples vary and the worst lesion is considered, but the summary says clean lymph nodes and vesicles, maybe the worst is benign. So presence "ei", Gleason NA. 

But the original prostate findings are maintained. If the original was a cancer case, then presence is "kyllä". But the text doesn't say. 

This is a bit ambiguous, but given the information, the safest answers might be:

1. NA (sample type not specified)
2. NA (malignancy status unclear)
3. NA (no Gleason reported as malignancy not confirmed)

But the user might expect that if the original findings are maintained, and if the original was a cancer case, then presence is "kyllä". But without explicit mention, perhaps the answer is NA. 

Alternatively, since the samples vary and the worst is considered, but the summary doesn't mention cancer, maybe "ei". 

Hmm. I think the answer here is:

1. NA
2. ei
3. NA

Because the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, and the original prostate findings are maintained but not specified as malignant. So assuming no malignancy in the current samples, hence "ei".
