Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate..." So RP is the sample type here. That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions "One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes." Both of these indicate malignancy. So the answer here is definitely "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants it in the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3." Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. It could mean either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. In Gleason scoring, 4+3=7 is considered more aggressive than 3+4=7. So the higher grade pattern (4) as the major component would be more severe. However, the way it's written here is "3+4/4+3," which might indicate uncertainty between the two. But since we need to pick the most severe, we should go with 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7."

Wait, but sometimes pathologists list the primary pattern first. If it's written as 3+4/4+3, maybe they are presenting both possibilities. But the user says to take the most severe. Since 4+3 is worse than 3+4, we should report that. So the answer here is "4+3=7."

Other points: The tumor penetrating the capsule (T3b) and lymph node involvement (N1) confirm malignancy. The seminal vesicles have no malignancy, which doesn't affect the malignant findings field since there's malignancy elsewhere.

So the structured JSON should be:

1. Original sample type: "RP"
2. Malignant tumor: "yes"
3. Gleason grade: "4+3=7"

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe Gleason is considered. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
