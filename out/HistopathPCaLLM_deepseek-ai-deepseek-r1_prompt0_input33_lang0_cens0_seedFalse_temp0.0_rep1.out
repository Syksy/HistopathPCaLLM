Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate," so the sample type is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The report states "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions lymph node involvement (N1). So, malignant findings are present. The answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3." The user wants the most severe lesion's result. Both 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are possible, but since they're presented as alternatives, I need to pick the higher grade. However, the exact wording is "3+4/4+3," which might indicate uncertainty between the two. But the instruction says to report the most severe. Between 3+4 and 4+3, 4+3 is considered more severe. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7."

Wait, but the user allows "major+minor=sum" as the format. So major is the higher grade. In 3+4, major is 4, sum is 7. In 4+3, major is 4, sum is 7. But the way it's written here is "3+4/4+3" which could mean either. However, since the user wants the most severe lesion, and 4+3 is worse than 3+4, we should report 4+3=7. But the text doesn't specify which one was actually found; it's written as a variation. Hmm. Maybe the correct approach is to list both? But the user says to take the most severe. So if both are possible, but the highest possible is 4+3, then that's the one to report. Alternatively, maybe the presence of both indicates that the sum is 7, but the major and minor components are uncertain. However, the user expects a single value. Since the options are presented as 3+4/4+3, perhaps the correct way is to take the higher of the two, which is 4+3=7. So the answer would be "4+3=7".

Other parts: T3b is the staging, but that's not needed here. Lymph node involvement (N1) confirms malignancy. No malignancy in seminal vesicles, but that's not the most severe part. So the key points are RP sample, yes for malignancy, and Gleason 4+3=7.
