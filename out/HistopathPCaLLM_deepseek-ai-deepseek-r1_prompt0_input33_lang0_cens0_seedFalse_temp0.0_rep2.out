Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want:

1. **Original sample type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA". Looking at the statement, the first line mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate". That clearly indicates the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions lymph nodes with "N1" which is a sign of metastasis. Also, the Gleason grades are given, which are associated with malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason grade**: The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". This is a bit tricky because it lists two possible patterns. However, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the latter (4+3) is considered more severe because the primary grade is higher. So the correct Gleason grade should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. The sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. The other parts like T3b and lymph nodes are additional details but not required for the structured fields. The seminal vesicles have no malignancy, which supports the "yes" for malignancy since the main tumor is present.
