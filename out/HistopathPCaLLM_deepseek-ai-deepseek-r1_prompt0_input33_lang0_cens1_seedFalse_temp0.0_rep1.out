Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol." There's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states: "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." Wait, "seminal vehicles" might be a typo. It's likely supposed to be "seminal vesicles." Even if there's a typo, the key part is "No malignant findings." However, the text also mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes." But the user specified to consider only the most severe lesion. Malignant findings would be more severe than abnormal, but here it's "no malignant" in seminal vesicles. However, the lymph nodes part is "possibly abnormal," which isn't explicitly malignant. So the answer here would be "no" because there's a direct statement of no malignant findings. But wait, maybe the lymph nodes part is a malignant finding? The text says "possibly abnormal," which is uncertain. Since the user wants the most severe lesion, and the only definite statement is "No malignant findings," then the answer is "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignant findings are "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures. JSON should be valid. Let me double-check the original text for any missed details. The text mentions "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but that's not explicitly malignant. The user's instruction says to take the most severe lesion, but if there's no malignancy, then Gleason is NA. So the final JSON should have all three fields as NA, no, NA respectively.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
