Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided text: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol." There's no mention of the specific sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text states: "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." Wait, "seminal vehicles" might be a typo for "seminal vesicles". Assuming that's the case, the report explicitly says there are no malignant findings there. However, the text also mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed samples." But "abnormal" doesn't necessarily mean malignant. The key part here is "No malignant findings", so the answer should be "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers or "NA" if benign. Since the malignant findings are "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason score in the text either, which supports using "NA".

Also, the instructions say to consider only the most severe lesion. But in this case, there's no malignancy reported, so the most severe is benign. Therefore, all three fields are determined as "NA", "no", and "NA" respectively.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each part. The sample type isn't specified, so "NA". Malignant findings are "no" because of the explicit statement. Gleason grade is "NA" because there's no malignancy. That all fits. No typos in the JSON keys. Alright, that should be it.
