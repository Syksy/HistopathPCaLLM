Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The text starts with "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti..." which translates to radical prostatectomy. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" which means malignant findings. There's a tumor that has penetrated the capsule (T3b) and a lymph node metastasis (1/4, N1). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". The user wants the worst lesion's result. The highest possible here is 4+3=7. So the format should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. Also, check that all values fit the allowed options. Everything seems to fit. No NA needed here since there are malignant findings and a valid Gleason score.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
