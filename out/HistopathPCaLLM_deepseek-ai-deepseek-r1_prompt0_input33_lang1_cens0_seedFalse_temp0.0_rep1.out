Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti." "Radikaalipostatetoktomia" translates to radical prostatectomy in English. So the sample type should be "RP."

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia" (the tumor has penetrated the capsule) and "imusolmukkeissa yksi löydös (1/4, N1)" which indicates lymph node involvement. Both of these are malignant findings. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3." The user wants the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The two options given are 3+4=7 and 4+3=7. Since 4+3 is considered a higher grade than 3+4 even though the sum is the same, the worst would be 4+3=7. However, the problem says to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) result. The text lists both 3+4 and 4+3, so which one is the worst? In Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (major) is the most prevalent, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, when two patterns are present, the higher grade is considered the major. If the text mentions both 3+4 and 4+3, it might be indicating variability, but the worst would be 4+3=7. But the correct approach here is to take the highest sum, but both sum to 7. However, in clinical practice, 4+3 is worse than 3+4. So the answer should be "4+3=7". But the user might expect the highest possible sum, but since both are 7, but the major component is higher in 4+3. So the correct Gleason grade here is "4+3=7".

Wait, but the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). The text says "kasvutapa vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3" which means the growth pattern varies between 3+4 and 4+3. So the worst among these is 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: RP
2. Malignant findings: kyllä
3. Gleason: 4+3=7

{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
