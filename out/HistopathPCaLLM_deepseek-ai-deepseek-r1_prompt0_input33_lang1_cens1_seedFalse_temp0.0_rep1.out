Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant findings, and the reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The term "näytteet" (samples) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text also mentions "imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä" which refers to lymph nodes processed in macro sections, but that doesn't specify the original sample type. Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, in the seminal vesicles, there are no malignant findings. However, earlier it mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista..." which are abnormal findings in lymph nodes. But the key here is whether there are any malignant findings. The explicit statement says "Ei maligneja" (no malignant) in seminal vesicles. The other parts mention abnormal findings but not necessarily malignant. So, the presence of malignant findings would be "ei" (no).

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So, the third field is "NA".

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but since there are no malignancies, all Gleason-related info is NA. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested, so each field is a top-level key in the JSON.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
