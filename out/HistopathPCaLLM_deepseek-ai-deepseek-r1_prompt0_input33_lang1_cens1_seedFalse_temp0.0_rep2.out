Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The term "näytteet" (samples) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the type isn't specified, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles. The report doesn't mention any other malignant findings elsewhere. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct without nested elements. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Maligneja löydöksiä" definitely means malignant findings, so "ei" is correct. The sample type isn't specified, so "NA" is right. Gleason isn't mentioned, so "NA" again. All seems in order.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
