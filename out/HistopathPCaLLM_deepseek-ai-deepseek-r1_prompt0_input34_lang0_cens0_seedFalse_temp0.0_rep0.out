Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the statement, it starts with "The presented sample is a resection..." The term "resection" here is key. TURP is a type of resection procedure, so the sample type should be "TURP". I don't see any mention of biopsy or RP, so TURP is the right choice here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states, "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities." So clearly, the answer here is "no".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report says there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy mentioned, so all answers should reflect that. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Everything seems to fit.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
