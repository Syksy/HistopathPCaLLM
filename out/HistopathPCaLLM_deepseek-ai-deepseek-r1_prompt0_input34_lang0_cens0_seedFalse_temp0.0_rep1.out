Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input mentions "resection" and "six tissue casettes." Resection often refers to TURP when it's prostate-related, so I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities." So the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were grades mentioned, since it's benign, we stick with NA. 

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, without nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy. So the final JSON should have TURP, no, and NA.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
