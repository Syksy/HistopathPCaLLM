Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The presented sample is a resection..." The term "resection" here is key. TURP is a type of resection, so I should check if there's any mention of TURP specifically. The report doesn't mention TURP explicitly, but since it's a resection and considering common procedures, TURP is a likely candidate. However, sometimes "resection" can refer to other types. Wait, the sample weighs 7.5 grams. TURP specimens are usually smaller compared to radical prostatectomy. RP specimens are the entire prostate, which would weigh more, but 7.5 grams is actually on the lower side. Hmm, maybe it's a TURP. Alternatively, maybe it's a partial resection. The report mentions six tissue cassettes, which might be typical for TURP. I think TURP is the correct answer here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states, "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." Also, "no malignities" are mentioned. So the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report says no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignant findings are no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of any other lesions. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion, but since there's no malignancy, that's straightforward. No nested structures, just flat JSON. Check again for any possible errors. The sample is a resection, TURP is a resection type. Yes, that's correct. Malignancy is explicitly denied. Gleason isn't applicable here. So the JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
