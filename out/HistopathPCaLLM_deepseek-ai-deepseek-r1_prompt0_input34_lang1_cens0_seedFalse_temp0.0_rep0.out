Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "7.5gr resekaattia" which translates to resection material. TURP is a type of resection, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "ei mitään malignia" which means no malignancy found. Also, it mentions that there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy here, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only the worst lesion is considered. In this case, since there's no malignancy, all fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I didn't miss anything. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is negative, and Gleason is NA. That seems correct.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
