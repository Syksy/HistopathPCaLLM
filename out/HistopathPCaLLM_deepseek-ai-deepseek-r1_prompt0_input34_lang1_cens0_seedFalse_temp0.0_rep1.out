Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "7.5gr resekaattia" which translates to "7.5g of resection material." The term "resekaatti" in Finnish typically refers to a resection specimen. TURP is a type of resection, so the sample type here is likely TURP. Biopsy would be a smaller sample, and RP is the entire prostate, which isn't mentioned here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan" which means "No findings suggest prostate adenocarcinoma." Also, it mentions "ei mitään malignia" translating to "no malignancy." So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or malignant findings. Since Gleason grading is only applicable to malignant cases, the value here should be "NA."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. Let me double-check each field. Sample type: TURP. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. That fits the requirements.

```json
{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
