Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "7.5gr resekaattia" which translates to "7.5g of resection material." The term "resekaatti" suggests a resection, which is typically a TURP procedure. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan" (No findings suggest adenocarcinoma) and "ei mitään malignia" (no malignancy). So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with the absence of cancer. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to confirm. Yes, TURP is correct for resection, malignancy is negative, and Gleason is NA. All fields fit the allowed values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
