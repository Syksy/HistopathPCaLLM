Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as weighing 7.5 grams and prepared into six cassettes totaling 7 grams. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, while RP and TURP are larger. TURP specimens are typically from resections, often for benign conditions. However, the weight here is 7.5 grams, which is a bit ambiguous. RP specimens can be larger, but sometimes TURP can also be in this range. The text mentions "hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta" which translates to hyperplastic prostate tissue, commonly seen in TURP specimens for benign prostatic hyperplasia. So I'm leaning towards TURP here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." which means the findings do not indicate prostate (cancer). Also, there's mention of hyperplastic tissue with chronic inflammation, which is benign. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scoring, which further supports this.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the sample type. The term "TURP" is used when tissue is resected, often for BPH, which aligns with hyperplastic tissue mentioned. Biopsy would be if they took a sample to check for cancer, but here the findings are benign, and the sample size is larger. So TURP seems correct.

Malignancy is clearly negative here. Gleason is not applicable. So the final JSON should have TURP, ei, NA.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
