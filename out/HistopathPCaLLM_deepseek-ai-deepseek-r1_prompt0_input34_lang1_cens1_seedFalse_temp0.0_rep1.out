Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as weighing 7.5 grams and prepared into six cassettes totaling 7 grams. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, while RP and TURP are larger. TURP specimens are typically from resections, often for benign conditions. However, the weight here is 7.5 grams, which is a bit ambiguous. RP specimens can be larger, but sometimes TURP can also be in this range. The text mentions "hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta" which translates to hyperplastic prostate tissue, commonly seen in TURP specimens for benign prostatic hyperplasia. So I'm leaning towards TURP here.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report states "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen" which means findings do not indicate prostate (maybe carcinoma?). Also, there's mention of cribriform growth, which can be a feature of cancer. Wait, the original text says "osittain cribriform kasvua" (partly cribriform growth). Cribriform pattern is often associated with higher grade prostate cancer. But the next sentence says the findings do not indicate prostate... maybe a typo? Or perhaps "eivät viittaa eturauhasen syöpään" (do not indicate prostate cancer). The exact translation is crucial. The text says "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." Maybe it's missing a word, but assuming it means no malignancy. Also, hyperplastic tissue with chronic inflammation is benign. So the presence of cribriform growth might be a red flag, but if the conclusion is that it's not indicative of cancer, then malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. Since if there's no malignancy, this should be NA. But wait, the presence of cribriform growth could be part of a Gleason pattern. However, if the overall assessment is that there's no cancer, then Gleason wouldn't be reported. The key is whether the cribriform growth here is considered malignant. If the report says the findings don't indicate prostate (cancer), then even if there's cribriform, it's not malignant. So Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA. Need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances in the Finnish terms. "Cribriform kasvua" could be part of a benign condition, but more commonly it's a cancer feature. However, the explicit statement that findings don't indicate prostate (cancer) overrides that. So final answer would be TURP, ei, NA.
