Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want:

1. **Original sample type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". I need to check the text for terms indicating the sample type. The given statement starts with "Samples 1-6 are representative prostate biopsies..." so "biopsy" is clearly mentioned here. That should be the answer for the first field.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states "No signs of carcinoma." Carcinoma refers to cancer, so if there's no carcinoma, that means no malignant findings. However, there's a mention of "high-grade PIN-changes". High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't classified as malignant itself. So the answer here should be "no" because there's no actual carcinoma detected.

3. **Reported Gleason grade**: The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report says there's no carcinoma, the Gleason score wouldn't be applicable here. So the answer here is "NA".

Now, I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion. The text mentions high-grade PIN and hyperplasia. PIN is more severe than hyperplasia, but since it's not malignant, the most severe finding is still benign. Therefore, the answers remain as above.

Putting it all together in JSON without any nested structures. Let me double-check the original text for any possible oversights. The samples are biopsies, no carcinoma, and no Gleason provided. Yep, that's all correct.

{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
