Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the Gleason grade. The allowed values for each are specified, so I have to make sure I stick to those.

Looking at the sample text: "Samples 1-6 are representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe." The original sample type here is clearly "biopsy" since it mentions biopsies. So the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant tumors. The text states, "No signs of carcinoma." Carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so if there's no carcinoma, the answer here should be "no". The mention of high-grade PIN changes is a pre-malignant condition, but not malignant itself. So "no" is correct.

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no carcinoma reported, the Gleason grade isn't applicable here. So the third field should be "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON is valid, with the correct keys and values. Also, the user specified that only the most severe lesion's results should be returned, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so the most severe is the high-grade PIN, which isn't malignant. Therefore, the answers are straightforward.

Double-checking the allowed values: "biopsy" is allowed for sample type, "no" for malignancy, and "NA" for Gleason. Everything seems to fit. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Alright, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
