Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are from left and right lobe." The term "samples" is a bit generic. The report doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I think the answer here is "NA" because there's no explicit mention of the procedure type.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement mentions "small high-grade PIN-changes." High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't classified as malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. Since there's no mention of invasive carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, the malignancy here would be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the tumor findings are benign (no malignancy), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The most severe here is high-grade PIN, which isn't cancer. So, all answers should reflect that there's no malignancy. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures and must be valid. Let me double-check the terms to make sure I didn't miss anything. The sample type isn't specified, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. That seems right.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
