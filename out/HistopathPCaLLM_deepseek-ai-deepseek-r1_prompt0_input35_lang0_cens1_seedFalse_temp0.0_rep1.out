Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are from left and right lobe." The term "samples" here is a bit generic. It doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since there's no mention of the procedure type, I should go with NA for this field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "small high-grade PIN-changes." High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't classified as malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, the malignant finding here would be "no."

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report doesn't indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of Gleason scores here, which aligns with the benign findings.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check the input statement again to confirm there's no overlooked detail. Yep, looks right. No typos in the key terms. Alright, ready to structure the JSON response.
