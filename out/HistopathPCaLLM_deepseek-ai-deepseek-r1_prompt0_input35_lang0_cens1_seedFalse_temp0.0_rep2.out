Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions samples from left and right lobes. Typically, biopsies are taken from different lobes, so I think the sample type here is "biopsy". There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so "biopsy" makes sense.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report notes high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes. High-grade PIN is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. Since there's no mention of invasive carcinoma, the malignant finding should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is "NA".

So, compiling the answers: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Here, the most severe is high-grade PIN, which isn't malignant. All checks done.
