Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "biopsiat", which is Finnish for biopsies. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since the sample is clearly biopsies, the answer here should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta", which translates to "No signs of carcinoma". The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". So the answer here is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no carcinoma detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So this should be "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The given example doesn't mention any Gleason components, so that's straightforward. All three fields are covered correctly based on the provided text.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
