Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä 1-6 on edustavat biopsiat oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta." The key word here is "biopsiat", which translates to biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "pieniä korkean asteen PIN-muutoksia" (small high-grade PIN changes) and "hyperplasiaa" (hyperplasia). High-grade PIN is considered a pre-malignant condition, but not cancer. The crucial part is "Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta" (No signs of carcinoma). Since carcinoma indicates malignancy and it's explicitly stated there's none, the malignancy presence should be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no carcinoma detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable here. So the value should be "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields correctly filled based on the analysis.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
