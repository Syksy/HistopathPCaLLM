Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta." The word "näytteet" means samples, but there's no mention of the procedure type. It doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia" which is high-grade PIN. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is considered a pre-malignant condition, not outright cancer. The other findings are hyperplasia and some proliferations, which are benign. Since there's no mention of carcinoma, the answer should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is major+minor=sum. But since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score wouldn't be applicable. So the value here is NA.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any terms indicating cancer. Words like "carcinoma" or "adenocarcinoma" would be red flags, but they aren't present. The key here is distinguishing between PIN and actual cancer. High-grade PIN is a precursor but not malignant itself. Hyperplasia is benign. So the structured data should reflect no malignancy, hence Gleason is NA. Sample type remains NA because the procedure isn't specified.
