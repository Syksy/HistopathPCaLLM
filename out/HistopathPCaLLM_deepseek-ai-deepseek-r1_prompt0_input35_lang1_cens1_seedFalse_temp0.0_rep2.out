Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta." The term "näytteet" translates to samples, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia" which is high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). HGPIN is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia and some tissue formations, which are benign. There's no mention of carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, which would indicate malignancy. So, the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings reported, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions state to use "NA" for benign cases. So, the third field is "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled as determined.
