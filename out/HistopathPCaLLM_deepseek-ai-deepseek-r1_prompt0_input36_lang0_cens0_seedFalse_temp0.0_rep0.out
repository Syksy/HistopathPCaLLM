Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "preparate weighs 80gr" and the size. The preparation of macro cassettes and regular cassettes. TURP specimens are usually resected in chips and might be weighed, but RP is the entire prostate. However, the weight here is 80 grams, which is quite heavy. A normal prostate is about 20-30 grams, so 80gr might indicate an enlarged prostate, common in TURP procedures. Also, TURP often uses cassettes. So I think the sample type is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "No signs of malignity or inflammation." So the answer here is "no".

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were grades mentioned, since it's benign, it's NA.

So putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me double-check each part. The sample type reasoning seems solid. Malignancy is clearly stated as no. Gleason is NA. Yep, that's correct.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
