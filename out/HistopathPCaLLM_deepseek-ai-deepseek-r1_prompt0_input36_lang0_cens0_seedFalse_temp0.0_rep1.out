Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided statement, the preparate weighs 80 grams and the size is 7x6x5 cm. The mention of macro cassettes and regular cassettes might indicate the type of sample. TURP specimens are usually multiple chips, while RP is the entire prostate. However, the weight here is 80 grams, which is quite heavy. A normal prostate is about 20-30 grams, so an 80gr specimen might be an RP, as benign hyperplasia can make the prostate larger. Also, TURP usually results in many small chips, but the preparate here is a single large piece. So sample type is likely RP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity or inflammation." So the answer here is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The Gleason score is only reported for malignant cases.

So putting it all together: sample type RP, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm. Yes, no mention of biopsy or TURP specifics, and the weight and size point towards RP. Malignancy is explicitly ruled out. All set.
