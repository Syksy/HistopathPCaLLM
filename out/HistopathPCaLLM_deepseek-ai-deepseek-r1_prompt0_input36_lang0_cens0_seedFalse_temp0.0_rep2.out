Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the preparate weighs 80 grams and the size is 7x6x5 cm. The mention of "macro cassettes" and "regular cassettes" makes me think this is a surgical specimen. TURP specimens are usually smaller, while RP is the entire prostate. The weight here is 80 grams, which is quite large. A normal prostate is about 20-30 grams, so an 80gr specimen might be from a radical prostatectomy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, TURP can sometimes yield larger specimens in cases of significant hyperplasia, but typically TURP is for removing part of the prostate. The size here is 7x6x5 cm, which is substantial. RP specimens are usually the whole prostate, so maybe that's the case here. So I'll go with RP for the sample type.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity or inflammation." So the answer here should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: sample type RP, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me double-check the original text for any clues I might have missed. The macroscopic description mentions nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia microscopically, which are benign conditions. No mention of tumor or cancer, so definitely no malignancy. The sample type is a bit tricky, but given the weight and size, RP seems more likely than TURP. Biopsy would be smaller. So I think RP is correct here.
