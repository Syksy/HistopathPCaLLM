Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes." There's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The preparation of cassettes might be part of processing a sample, but without specific terms, I can't determine the sample type. So, the answer here would be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states "Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably." Nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia are typically benign conditions. However, the note says it wasn't reliably assessed. But since there's no mention of malignancy (like cancer, carcinoma, or tumor), and hyperplasias are benign, the answer here should be "no". Even though the assessment wasn't reliable, the presence of malignancy isn't indicated, so "no" seems appropriate.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scoring in the report, which aligns with the benign findings.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the most severe finding here is hyperplasia, which is benign. So all three fields are covered correctly. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting, and values as specified.
