Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes." The terms "macro cassettes" and "regular cassettes" are part of processing tissue samples. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I might have to infer based on the context. But since there's no direct mention, the safest answer here is "NA".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably." Nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia are typically benign conditions. However, the key point here is that the assessment wasn't reliable. But the presence of hyperplasia, even if not reliably assessed, doesn't indicate malignancy. Since there's no mention of malignancy (like carcinoma, tumor, etc.), the answer should be "no". Wait, but the user says "were there malignant tumor findings". If the assessment wasn't reliable, does that affect the answer? The statement doesn't report any malignant findings, just benign ones. So "no" is correct here.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA". Since the report doesn't mention any malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. So "NA" is the right answer here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check each part. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. No malignancy detected, so no. Gleason not applicable. Yep, that seems right.
