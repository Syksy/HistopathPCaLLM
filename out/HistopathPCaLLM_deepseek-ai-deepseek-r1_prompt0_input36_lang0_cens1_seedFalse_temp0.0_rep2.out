Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes." There's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of cassettes might relate to how the sample was processed, but without specific terms, I can't determine the sample type. So, the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia." Both hyperplasia types are generally benign. There's no indication of malignancy like carcinoma, tumor, or cancer mentioned. The phrase "was not assessed reliably" might introduce some uncertainty, but the presence of hyperplasia without malignant terms suggests the answer is no. However, since it's not assessed reliably, maybe NA? Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the assessment is unreliable, but the findings mentioned are benign, then the answer is no. Because even if the assessment isn't reliable, the observed findings are non-malignant. So, "no" for malignant tumor findings.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the tumor findings are no (benign), the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of Gleason scores here either, which aligns with a benign diagnosis.

So, compiling this into JSON without nested structures and only the most severe lesion (which in this case is hyperplasia, a benign condition), the structured data should be:

1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: no
3. Gleason grade: NA

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
