Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Preparaatti painaa 80 grammaa ja on kooltaan noin 7 x 6 x 5 cm." Then it says "Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 tavallista kasettia." Hmm, the weight and size might indicate a radical prostatectomy (RP), since biopsies or TURP specimens are usually smaller. RP samples are typically larger, like 80 grams here. The mention of macro cassettes also supports RP, as they process larger specimens. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The text clearly states "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." So no malignancy found. That means the answer is "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So the third field is "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and the allowed values are respected. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: RP is allowed. Malignity: ei is correct. Gleason: NA as expected. All fields are covered, and the syntax should be valid JSON.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
