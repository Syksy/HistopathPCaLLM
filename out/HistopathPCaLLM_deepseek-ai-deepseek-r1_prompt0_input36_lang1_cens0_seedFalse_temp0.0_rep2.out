Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Preparaatti painaa 80 grammaa ja on kooltaan noin 7 x 6 x 5 cm." The weight and size here are quite large. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, so this might be from a prostatectomy. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the weight is 80 grams, which is typical for a radical prostatectomy (RP), I'll go with "RP".

Next, malignancy. The text clearly states "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." That translates to "No malignancy or inflammation found." So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: RP. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. Yep, that fits the requirements.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
