Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The terms "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" refer to the processing of the sample, but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here, so I should put "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "näytteistä löydettiin nodulaarista hyperplasiaa, mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan." Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number but is typically benign. The key here is that there's no mention of carcinoma or malignancy. However, the last part says "ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan" which translates to "could not reliably assess". But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since hyperplasia is benign and there's no mention of cancer, the answer should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the sample is benign (no malignancy), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. Sample type: NA
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA

  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
