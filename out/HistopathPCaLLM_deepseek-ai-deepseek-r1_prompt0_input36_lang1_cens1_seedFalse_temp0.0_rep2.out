Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The terms "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" refer to cassettes used in processing the sample. But there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, presence of malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "nodulaarista hyperplasiaa" and "epiteelin hyperplasiaa", which are hyperplastic changes. Hyperplasia is generally benign. The report states "ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan" regarding the assessment. However, hyperplasia is not malignant. Since there's no mention of cancer (carcinoma) or malignancy, and the findings are benign, the answer here should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there are no malignant lesions. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested. So the JSON should have the three keys with the determined values.

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
