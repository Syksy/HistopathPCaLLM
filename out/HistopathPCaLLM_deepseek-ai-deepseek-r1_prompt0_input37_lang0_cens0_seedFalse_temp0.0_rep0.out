Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." Electrosection chippings are typically from a TURP procedure, where tissue is removed using an electric loop. So sample type should be TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The report mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "findings indicate hyperplasia." Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's no mention of cancer, so the answer here is "no."

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the tumor is benign (hyperplasia), Gleason grade isn't applicable. So that's NA.

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
