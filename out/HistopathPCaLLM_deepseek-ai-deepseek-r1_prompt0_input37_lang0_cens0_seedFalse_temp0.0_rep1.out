Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." Electrosection chippings are typically from TURP procedures, where tissue is removed using an electric loop. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "findings indicate hyperplasia." Hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells, which is benign. There's no mention of malignancy like cancer or tumor. So the answer here should be "no."

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum as whole numbers if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the findings are benign (hyperplasia), there's no Gleason score reported. So this field should be "NA."

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, with no nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy. So the final JSON should have TURP, no, and NA.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
