Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "total sample material preparated" but doesn't specify the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states that the examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components and minor inflammation. There's no mention of malignancy, cancer, or tumor. Since it's not explicitly stated, and the samples are to be examined further, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here should be no. Wait, but the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. However, the report doesn't indicate any malignant findings. So "no" is appropriate.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "no" here, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason scores in the text either.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Let me check the example again. The user wants valid JSON with those three keys. Yes, that's straightforward. No errors in the structure. Alright, that should be it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
