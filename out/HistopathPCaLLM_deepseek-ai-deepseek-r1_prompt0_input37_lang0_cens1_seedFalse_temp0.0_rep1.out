Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, there's no mention of the sample type. It just says "total sample material preparated" but doesn't specify the procedure. So I'll put "NA" here.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions prostate tissue with nodular gland components and minor inflammation, but no mention of malignancy. Since it's not stated, but the user says to consider the most severe lesion, and there's no indication of cancer, I think "no" is appropriate. But wait, sometimes reports might imply malignancy through other terms. Here, they mention samples are to be examined further, which suggests uncertainty. However, based on the given info, there's no explicit malignant finding, so "no" seems right. But maybe "NA" if it's not determined yet. Hmm. The note says "samples are going to be examined further next week," which implies the current exam didn't find malignancy but needs more tests. So the answer here is "no" because as of now, no malignancy is found. But if the initial exam is inconclusive, maybe "NA"? The instructions say to use "NA" if the information isn't available. Since the current exam didn't find it but more tests are pending, maybe "no" is correct because the existing findings don't indicate malignancy. So I'll go with "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since there's no malignancy reported, this should be "NA".

So the structured JSON would be:
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and the values are correct. The sample type isn't specified, so "NA". No malignancy found yet, so "no". Gleason grade isn't applicable here, so "NA". That should cover it.

  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
