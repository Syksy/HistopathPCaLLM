Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "total sample material preparated" but doesn't specify the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, I should put NA for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions prostate tissue with nodular gland components and minor inflammation. There's no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or tumor. Since it's not stated, and the samples are to be examined further, I can't assume malignancy. So, the answer here would be no. Wait, but the user says "malignant tumor findings" – if there's no evidence, should it be no or NA? The report doesn't indicate any malignancy found, so maybe 'no' is appropriate. But sometimes, if the examination is inconclusive, it might be NA. However, the user's instruction says to return NA only if it's not applicable. Since the report doesn't mention any malignancy, but the examination was limited, maybe 'no' is safer. Hmm, but the samples are going to be examined further, which suggests that the current findings are incomplete. In that case, maybe NA is better. Wait, the instruction says "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the current examination didn't find any, but it's incomplete, should we mark it as no or NA? The report says "further examination was not possible at this time," so maybe the current findings don't show malignancy, hence 'no'. But if the exam is incomplete, perhaps NA is more accurate. The user's instruction says to answer based on the provided statement. Since the statement doesn't mention any malignancy, even if it's incomplete, the answer should be 'no' because as per the current findings, there's no malignancy. So, 'no' for the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases or NA otherwise. Since the second field is 'no' (no malignancy), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were some grades mentioned, if there's no malignancy, it's NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so definitely NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no mention of multiple lesions, this should be straightforward.
