Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "elektrosektiolastuja". I need to map that to the allowed values. "Elektrosektio" probably refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), since TURP is often done using electrocautery. So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "hyperplasia", which is benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy terms like adenocarcinoma, neoplasia, etc. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The Gleason score is only required if there are malignant findings.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the specified keys. Let me double-check the allowed values for each field. Sample type: TURP is allowed. Malignancy: "ei" is correct. Gleason: "NA" because it's benign. All fields accounted for, no errors here.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
