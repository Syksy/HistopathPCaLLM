Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "elektrosektiolastuja". I know that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate through the urethra. "Elektrosektio" likely refers to electroresection, which is part of a TURP procedure. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydös siis hyperplasia." Hyperplasia is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is non-cancerous. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy here. So the presence of malignant findings should be "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". Gleason scoring is only applicable if there's cancer present. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which makes sense because it's hyperplasia, a benign condition.

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion findings. In this case, since there's no cancer, all fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I'm mapping them correctly. Yes, TURP is correct for the sample type, hyperplasia is benign, so malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".

No conflicting information in the text. All required fields are addressed. The answer should be in the specified JSON format without any markdown. Alright, that's all.
