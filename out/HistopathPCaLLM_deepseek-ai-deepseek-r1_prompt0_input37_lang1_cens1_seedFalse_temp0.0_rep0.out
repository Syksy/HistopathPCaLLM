Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text talks about "näytemateriaalista" (sample material) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "eturauhaskudosta" (prostate tissue) with some nodular gland components and slight inflammation. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignant cells. The text also states that further examination isn't possible now and samples will be checked next week. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer is "ei" (no).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't present here, the answer is "NA".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm there's no hidden mention of cancer. Words like "pahanlaatuisia" (malignant) aren't present. The report is inconclusive, pending further tests. So, all three fields correctly map to "NA", "ei", and "NA".
