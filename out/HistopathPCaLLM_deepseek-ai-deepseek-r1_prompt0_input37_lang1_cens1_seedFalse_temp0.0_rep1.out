Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Alle puolet mahdollisesta näytemateriaalista valmisteltuna." It mentions "näytemateriaalista" which translates to sample material, but there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "Histologisessa tarkastelussa nähdään eturauhaskudosta, jossa osittain nodulaarisia rauhaskomponentteja. Paikoittain vähäistä inflammaatiota." It mentions prostate tissue with partially nodular gland components and some inflammation. There's no mention of cancer, malignancy, or any terms like carcinoma or neoplasia. The report also states that a more detailed examination wasn't possible now and samples will be examined more next week. Since there's no indication of malignancy in the current findings, the answer here should be "ei" (no).

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be NA. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are correctly mapped. Let me double-check each field. Sample type: NA. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. That seems right. The report doesn't provide enough info on the sample type, no malignancy detected yet, so Gleason isn't applicable.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
