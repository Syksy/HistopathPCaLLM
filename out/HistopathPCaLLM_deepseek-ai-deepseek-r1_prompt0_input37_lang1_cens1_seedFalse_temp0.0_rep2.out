Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text talks about "näytemateriaalista" (sample material) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "eturauhaskudosta" (prostate tissue) with some nodular gland components and slight inflammation. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or malignant cells. The text also states that further examination isn't possible now and samples will be checked next week. Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report is pending more tests, the answer here is "ei" (no) because there's no evidence of malignancy in the current findings. Wait, but the user might consider that if it's not mentioned, maybe it's "NA". However, the report does mention that the samples are to be examined more thoroughly next week, implying that current results are inconclusive. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the current analysis doesn't report any, the answer should be "ei".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there were some suspicion, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable.

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA
