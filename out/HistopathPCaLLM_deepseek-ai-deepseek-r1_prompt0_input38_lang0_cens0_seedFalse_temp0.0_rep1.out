Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The input text is: "Representative needle biopsies as samples. Total length approx 111 mm. In histological examination, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found. No suspected malignity."

First, the three fields to fill are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

For the first field, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "needle biopsies," so that's clearly a biopsy. So the answer here is "biopsy."

Second, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "No suspected malignity," which means no malignancy was found. So the answer is "no."

Third, Gleason grade. The instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason score here either, so definitely NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys should be straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. That all fits. No errors here. The most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, the only lesion mentioned is benign. So the answers are correct.
