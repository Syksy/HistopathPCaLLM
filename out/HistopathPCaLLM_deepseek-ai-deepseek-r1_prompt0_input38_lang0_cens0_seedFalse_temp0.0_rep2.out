Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to identify the original sample type. The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." Needle biopsies are typically associated with a biopsy procedure, so the first field should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states, "No suspected malignity." That clearly indicates there's no malignancy found, so the second field is "no."

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The user specified that Gleason is only for malignant cases. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structure in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, the most severe is benign. All fields check out. Let me format the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
