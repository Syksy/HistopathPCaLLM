Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Representative samples are collected. Total measurements provided in millimeters." The terms here don't specify the sample type. Biopsy, RP, and TURP are specific procedures, but the report just mentions "representative samples" without indicating which procedure was used. So, the sample type should be "NA" since it's not explicitly stated.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states: "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found." Hyperplasia refers to an increase in cell number, which is benign. Chronic inflammation is also a non-malignant finding. There's no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or tumor. So, the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the findings are benign (hyperplasia and inflammation), there's no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, this field is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have "NA" for sample type, "no" for malignancy, and "NA" for Gleason grade. I need to ensure the JSON is valid, without nested structures, and only includes the most severe lesion's results. Since there's no malignancy, the most severe is the benign findings. All fields correctly map to the allowed values.

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
