Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line says "Tutkittavana edustavia neulabiopsioita." The word "neulabiopsioita" translates to "needle biopsies." So the sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text states "Ei epäiltyä maligniteettia," which means "No suspicion of malignancy." So the answer here should be "ei" (no). Since there are no malignancies, the Gleason score would automatically be NA. But I need to confirm if there's any mention of Gleason in the report. The given text doesn't mention Gleason at all, which makes sense because there's no malignancy. So the third field is NA.

Now, structuring the JSON response. The user specified that the output shouldn't have nested structures and should only include the worst lesion's results. Since there's no malignancy, all fields should be filled accordingly. Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is NA. Everything seems to align with the provided text. No conflicting information here. I think that's all.

{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
