Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down the requirements step by step.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "neulabiopsioita", which is Finnish for "needle biopsies". So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Ei epäiltyä maligniteettia", translating to "No suspicion of malignancy". So the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, this should be "NA".

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested objects and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided in the problem seems to have the correct syntax. Let me double-check each field against the input text to confirm accuracy. All the required information is present, so the final JSON should reflect these values correctly.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
