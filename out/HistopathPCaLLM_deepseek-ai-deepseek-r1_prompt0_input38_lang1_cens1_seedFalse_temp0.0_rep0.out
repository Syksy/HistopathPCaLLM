Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä..." which translates to "Representative tissue samples under examination..." but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota" which translates to hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is benign, and chronic inflammation is also not malignant. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or any malignant terms. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade would automatically be "NA" as per the instructions. The Gleason score is only reported for malignant cases. 

I need to make sure there's no mention of any grades or scores. The text doesn't have terms like Gleason, grade, or any numbers that would indicate a score. So all three fields are determined: NA, ei, NA. 

Just to double-check, the original sample type isn't specified, so NA is correct. The findings are benign, so malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. No nested structures, just flat JSON with those three keys. That should be it.

{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
