Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The sample report mentions "kudosnäytteitä" which translates to tissue samples. But there's no specific mention of biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So I should go with NA here.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report states "hyperplastista prostatakudosta" which is hyperplastic prostate tissue, a benign condition. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings, it should be NA. The user specified that Gleason is only for malignant cases.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the exact keys and allowed values. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Hyperplasia is benign, chronic inflammation also non-malignant. Yep, no cancer here. So all three fields are correctly NA, ei, NA.

```json
{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
