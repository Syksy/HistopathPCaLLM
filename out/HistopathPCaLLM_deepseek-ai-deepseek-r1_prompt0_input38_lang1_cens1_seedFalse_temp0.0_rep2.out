Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä..." which translates to "Representative tissue samples under examination..." but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota" which translates to hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is usually benign, and there's no mention of cancer or malignancy. So the presence of malignancy would be "ei" (no).

Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were some mention, the text doesn't provide any Gleason scores. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys should be 1, 2, 3 with their respective values. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Hyperplastista is hyperplasia, which is benign. Chronic inflammation also doesn't indicate cancer. So all three fields are correctly NA, ei, NA.

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
