Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate." I know that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so the original sample type should be "RP." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The report says "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor..." and mentions Gleason grades. Since a tumor is present and Gleason scores are given, which are used for cancer grading, the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." The format requested is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. The correct entry would be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions 3 foci, but the highest Gleason is 3+4=7, which is what's reported. No other higher grades are mentioned. Checks for other possible sample types or conflicting info, but everything seems clear here. No mention of TURP or biopsy, so RP is correct. Malignant is yes because of the tumor and Gleason. Gleason is correctly formatted. Alright, that should cover it.

{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
