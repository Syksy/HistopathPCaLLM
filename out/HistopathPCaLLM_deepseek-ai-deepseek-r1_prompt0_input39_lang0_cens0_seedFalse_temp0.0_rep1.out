Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate." RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type should be "RP." That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says "reveal a tumor" and mentions Gleason grades, which are used for cancer grading. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the statement specifies "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." The format should be major+minor=sum. So 3+4=7. Need to present it as "3+4=7" in the JSON.

Check if there's a more severe lesion. The text mentions three foci, but the highest Gleason is 7 (3+4). No mention of higher grades elsewhere, so this is the most severe. Also, no nested structures allowed, so just the three fields in a flat JSON.

Make sure the values are exactly as allowed: RP, yes, and 3+4=7. No typos. JSON should be valid, so double-check quotes and commas. Alright, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
