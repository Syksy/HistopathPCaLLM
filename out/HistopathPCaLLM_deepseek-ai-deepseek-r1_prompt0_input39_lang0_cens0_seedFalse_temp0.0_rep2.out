Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement starts with "A prostatectomy preparate..." So prostatectomy indicates that the sample type is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "a tumor with 3 foci" and discusses Gleason grades, which are used for cancer grading. So the presence of a malignant tumor is confirmed. The answer here should be "yes".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 3+4=7. The correct format would be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there are three foci, but all are reported with Gleason 3 and 4, the highest grade here is 3+4=7. No higher grades are mentioned. Also, the structured data shouldn't have nested structures, so just a single entry for each field.

Double-checking for any possible errors. The sample type is definitely RP. Malignant is yes. Gleason is correctly formatted. No other findings contradict these. All set.
