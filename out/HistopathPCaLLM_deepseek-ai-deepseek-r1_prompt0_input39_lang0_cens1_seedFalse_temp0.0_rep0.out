Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine." There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it's uncertain, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here would be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The text says, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." Therefore, the Gleason grade is NA. The user specified to use "major+minor=sum" format only if it's a malignant case, which this isn't. So NA is appropriate here.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no clear lesion mentioned. All fields should be NA except maybe sample type if inferred, but the sample type isn't specified either. So all three fields are NA.
