Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each field and the requirements.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided statement: "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations." There's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample size is 20, but that doesn't indicate the type. So I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it's uncertain, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the report states it's unclear, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. But wait, the instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. If it's unclear, perhaps the answer should be "no"? Wait, no. If it's unclear, maybe the system can't determine, so "NA" is correct. But I need to check if "NA" is allowed here. The allowed values include "NA", so if the report is uncertain, "NA" makes sense.

Third, the reported Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers, or "NA" for benign. The statement says, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." So clearly, the Gleason score isn't available. Therefore, the value here is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (since the type isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: NA (since it's unclear)
3. Gleason grade: NA (as stated)

I need to make sure that the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. The keys should be as specified. Let me double-check the input statement again to confirm there's no mention of sample type. The sample size is 20, but that's just the size, not the type. The procedure mentions slices and microscopic inspection at 3 locations, which might suggest biopsy, but unless explicitly stated, I shouldn't assume. So "NA" is safe.

Yes, the answer should be all "NA" for the three fields.
