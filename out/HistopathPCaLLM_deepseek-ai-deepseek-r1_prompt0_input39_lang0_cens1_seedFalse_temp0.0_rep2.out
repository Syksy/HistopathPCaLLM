Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted..." but there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the sample type here is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it's uncertain, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The report doesn't state a clear yes or no, so the answer here should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. The report explicitly states, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." So even though there's uncertainty about malignancy, since the Gleason isn't assessed, it's definitely NA here.

Also, the user mentioned to consider only the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions, just uncertainty. So all fields would be NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check each part again to be sure. Yep, looks like all three should be NA.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
