Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy is typically RP, I'll go with "RP" for the first field.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions finding a tumor ("kasvain") with Gleason 3 and 4. That's definitely malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason 3 (major) ja 4... Gleason grade 7." The required format is major+minor=sum. So 3+4=7. The sum is 7, so the value should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions three foci, but the highest Gleason is 3+4=7, which is already accounted for. No other higher grades are present. Also, no signs of penetration into the capsule or seminal vesicles, but that doesn't affect the Gleason score here.

Double-checking the allowed values for each field. Original type is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All looks good. No NA needed here since all information is present.
