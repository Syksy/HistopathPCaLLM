Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report starts with "prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here is RP.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "löydetään kasvain," which means a tumor was found. Since a tumor is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states both Gleason 3 (major) and 4, summing to 7. The required format is "major+minor=sum," so it should be "3+4=7". The instructions specify this format as a string with integers for malignant cases, which applies here.

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to match the allowed values. Sample type RP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is properly formatted. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
