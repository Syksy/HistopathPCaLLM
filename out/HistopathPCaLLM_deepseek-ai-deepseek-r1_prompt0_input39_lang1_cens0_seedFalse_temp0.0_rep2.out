Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, so the sample type here is likely "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So RP fits here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "löydetään kasvain", which means a tumor was found. Also, they mention Gleason grades, which are used for cancerous tissue. So the presence of malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text specifies "Gleason 3 (major) että 4" leading to "Gleason grade 7". The required format is major+minor=sum. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. The correct entry would be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. No other lesions are mentioned as worse than this, so this is the primary one. The answer should be in the specified syntax without any additional nesting.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
