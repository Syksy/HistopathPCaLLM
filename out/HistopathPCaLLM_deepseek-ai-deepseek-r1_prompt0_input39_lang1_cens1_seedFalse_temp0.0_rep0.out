Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana näyte, jonka koko 20. Kudoksesta otetaan muutamia leikkeitä, jäljelle jäävä kudos tutkitaan normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The key terms here are "näyte" (sample) and "leikkeitä" (slices/cuttings). The mention of taking slices from the tissue might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, there's no explicit mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's not clear, maybe the safest choice here is "NA".

Next, the presence of malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states: "ei selvyyttä onko näkyvillä hyvänlaatuista hyperplasiaa tai jotain malignia." So, they couldn't determine if there's benign hyperplasia or something malignant. Since it's uncertain, the answer here should be "NA" because the report doesn't confirm the presence or absence definitively.

Third, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". The text says: "Gleason scorea ei pystytty määrittämään." They couldn't determine the Gleason score. Since malignancy wasn't confirmed (previous answer is "NA"), the Gleason score should also be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is unclear, so "NA"; malignancy is uncertain, so "NA"; Gleason score not determined, so "NA". Let me double-check if I missed any clues. The sample mentions taking slices from the tissue, but without specific terms like TURP or RP, "NA" seems correct. The malignancy part is explicitly uncertain, so "NA" is right. Gleason score couldn't be determined, so "NA" again. Yeah, that seems accurate.
