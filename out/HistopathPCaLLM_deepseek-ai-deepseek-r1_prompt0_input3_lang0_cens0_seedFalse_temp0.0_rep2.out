Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions based on the provided text and return the results in JSON format.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want:

1. **Original sample type**: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" if not available. I need to look at the sample description in the text to determine which one it is.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". I have to check if the report mentions any malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason grade**: This should be in the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the Gleason score is only relevant if there's malignancy, if the answer to the second question is "no" or "NA", this should be "NA".

Now, looking at the provided sample text:

"Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings. The material is started on one cassette. In histological inspection, spotted chronic inflammation is apparently, and the material gives an overall impression of stromal hyperplasia. Nothing indicating malignancy is found."

Breaking this down:

- **Sample type**: The term "prostate chippings" is mentioned. "Chippings" often refer to tissue fragments obtained during TURP procedures. Biopsy samples are usually cores or needle samples, and RP is the entire prostate. So here, TURP seems likely.

- **Malignancy**: The last sentence clearly states "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So the answer here is "no".

- **Gleason grade**: Since there's no malignancy, this should be "NA".

Now, I need to structure this into JSON without any nested structures. The user specified that only the most severe lesion's results should be returned, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so that's straightforward.

Double-checking the allowed values and the logic. Sample type is TURP, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. That all fits. No typos in the JSON keys. The format should be valid JSON with the three fields.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
