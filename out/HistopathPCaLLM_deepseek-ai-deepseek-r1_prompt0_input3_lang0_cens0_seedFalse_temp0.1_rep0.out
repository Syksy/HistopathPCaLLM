Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA". Looking at the sample text: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "chippings" often refers to TURP samples because TURP involves removing prostate tissue in small pieces. So I'll go with "TURP" here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." That clearly points to "no".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the answer here should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, the instructions specify to take the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all fields should reflect that. Let me double-check each part again to confirm. Yes, TURP for sample type, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason. That seems right.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
