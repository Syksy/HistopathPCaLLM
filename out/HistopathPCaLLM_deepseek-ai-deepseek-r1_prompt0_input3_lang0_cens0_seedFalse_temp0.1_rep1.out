Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." TURP typically yields chippings, as it's a procedure where prostate tissue is cut away in small pieces. Biopsy samples are usually cores or fragments, but "chippings" is more indicative of TURP. So the answer here should be "TURP".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So the answer here is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were benign findings, Gleason isn't applicable. So that's straightforward.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion's results. Since there's no malignancy, the most severe is benign. All fields check out. Let me double-check the sample type again. Yes, TURP fits because of the chippings. Biopsy samples are usually more structured. RP would be the entire prostate, which isn't the case here. So TURP is correct.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
