Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." Hmm, the mention of "single run" and the amount (dozen grams) makes me think. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, while RP and TURP are surgical procedures. TURP typically removes prostate tissue in cases of BPH, but the amount here might be more than usual. However, the exact procedure isn't explicitly stated. The term "primary sample" is vague. Since there's no clear indication of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should go with NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination... nothing conclusive may be derived." Since the examination was hindered and no conclusive evidence of malignancy is found, but there's no explicit mention of malignancy, the answer here should be "no" because if they couldn't confirm, maybe it's considered negative. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report says nothing conclusive, does that mean it's uncertain? But the user says to report the most severe lesion. Since there's no mention of malignancy, maybe "no" is appropriate. Alternatively, if the artifacts prevent determination, maybe NA. But the user instructions say to return NA only if the information isn't present. Since the report states that nothing conclusive can be derived, maybe the answer is "no" because there's no positive finding. Or perhaps NA because it's inconclusive. Hmm. The key is whether malignant findings were present. If the report doesn't mention any tumor, and the exam was inconclusive, but the user says to take the most severe lesion. Since inflammation is present but no tumor mentioned, maybe "no" for malignant findings. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again. The statement says "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." So they can't confirm either way. But the allowed values don't have an "inconclusive" option. The options are yes, no, or NA. Since the examination couldn't determine due to burn artefacts, maybe the answer is NA because the presence of malignancy couldn't be assessed. But the user says "malignant tumor findings" – if there's no mention, perhaps it's "no". But if the exam was inconclusive, maybe NA. I think in medical reports, if the sample is inadequate or artifacts prevent assessment, the result is often considered non-diagnostic, which would be NA here. So I'll go with NA for malignant tumor findings.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since there's no mention of any tumor, and the exam was inconclusive, the Gleason grade would be NA.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. But wait, the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." If there's no lesion reported, then maybe the answers are all NA. But the sample mentions inflammation, which is not a malignant finding. So malignant would be "no"? Wait, inflammation isn't a tumor. So if there's no tumor found, even if the exam is inconclusive, but the only finding is inflammation, then malignant would be "no". But the report says "nothing conclusive may be derived" because of burn artefacts. So maybe they couldn't assess properly. In that case, the presence of malignancy is unknown, hence NA. So the answer for malignant is NA. Therefore, all three fields would be NA. But let me check again. The original sample type: the user might expect TURP if it's a large sample. But the term "single run" might refer to TURP. TURP is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chunks, often leading to multiple chips. If the sample is over a dozen grams, that's a lot, which could be TURP. But I'm not certain. The user might expect TURP here. Alternatively, if the sample is from a prostatectomy (RP), but the term "primary sample" and "single run" is unclear. Without explicit terms like TURP or RP in the text, it's safer to put NA. So sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA.
