Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips or fragments, which is typical for a TURP procedure. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not described as chips. RP would involve the entire prostate, which isn't mentioned here. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," which means no direct signs of malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it explicitly says no malignancy, the answer here is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All three fields are top-level. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text to confirm. Yes, no mention of any Gleason scoring because there's no malignancy. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
