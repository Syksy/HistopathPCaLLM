Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips or fragments, which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not described as chips. RP would involve the entire prostate, which doesn't fit here. So the sample type is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," meaning no direct signs of malignancy. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. The answer here is straightforward as there's no malignancy, so all fields should be correctly filled as TURP, ei, and NA respectively.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
