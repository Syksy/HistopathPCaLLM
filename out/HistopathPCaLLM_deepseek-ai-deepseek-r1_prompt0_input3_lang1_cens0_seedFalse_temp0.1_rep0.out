Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips or fragments, which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. Biopsies are usually smaller and not described as chips. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be an entire prostate removal, which isn't mentioned here. So the sample type is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The text states: "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." This translates to "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions specify to use "NA" for benign findings. So the third field is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to confirm. The sample type is definitely TURP. Malignancy is absent, so "ei". Gleason is "NA". All conditions are met.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
