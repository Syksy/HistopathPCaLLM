Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips or fragments, which is commonly associated with TURP specimens. Biopsy samples are usually smaller cores, and RP refers to the entire prostate. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," which means "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the presence of malignant findings is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason score, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason grade should be NA. The instructions specify that if the findings are benign, Gleason is NA. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field should be a top-level key. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so Gleason isn't applicable. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because of the mention of chips. Biopsy would be core samples, RP is the whole prostate. The answer should be TURP. Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. That fits all the criteria.

  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
