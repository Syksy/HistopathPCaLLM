Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips, which is typical for TURP specimens. Biopsy samples are usually small cores, and RP is the entire prostate. So the original type here is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." That means no direct signs of malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is major+minor=sum. However, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So it should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. Yes, TURP is correct for chips. No malignancy, so Gleason is NA. Looks good.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
