Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The key term here is "ajetaan yhdellä kerral," which translates to something like "flushed once." That doesn't immediately point to biopsy, RP, or TURP. Biopsy is usually a small sample taken with a needle, RP is the entire prostate removed, and TURP is a procedure to remove part of the prostate. The description here mentions "prostatamateriaalia" (prostate material) but doesn't specify the procedure. Since it's unclear, maybe the sample type is NA here.

Next, presence of malignancy. The report says there's some inflammation but also cautery artifacts ("polttoartefaktat") that prevent reliable examination. The conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis can be made. So, there's no mention of malignancy, but the artifacts might obscure it. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since they can't confirm due to artifacts, but there's no positive mention, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report says they can't make a conclusive judgment because of artifacts, then it's possible that malignancy isn't confirmed. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the artifacts prevent reliable assessment, maybe the answer is NA. Because the presence can't be determined. The original text says "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" – no conclusive findings. So, since they can't confirm, maybe the answer is NA for the malignancy presence.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed (or there's no mention of it), the Gleason would be NA. 

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the sample type – the term "primäärinäyte" (primary sample) and "prostatamateriaalia" – maybe it's a TURP? Or biopsy? The text doesn't specify the procedure. The user might expect NA here if the procedure isn't clear. Alternatively, "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might refer to a biopsy, but I'm not sure. In Finnish medical terms, "ajetaan" could mean something like a flush, but I'm not certain. If unsure, NA is safer.

So the final answer would be all NAs. But let me double-check. The sample is prostate material, but the procedure isn't specified. So sample type NA. Malignancy: since they can't assess reliably, so presence is NA. Gleason: NA because no malignancy confirmed.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Raportissa ei mainita näytteenottotapaa (biopsia, RP, TURP), vaan ainoastaan epämääräinen "prostatamateriaali ajetaan yhdellä kerral".  
2. Tulehduslöydös on hyvänlaatuinen, mutta polttoartefaktat estävät luotettavan arvion pahanlaatuisuudesta. Lausunto korostaa, ettei konklusiivista johtopäätöstä voida tehdä.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei voida määrittää, koska pahanlaatuisuutta ei pystytty varmistamaan tai poissulkemaan.
