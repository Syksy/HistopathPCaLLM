Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" translates to something like "taken in one go," which might refer to a biopsy. However, I'm not entirely sure. The other options are RP and TURP, which are specific procedures. Since the text doesn't mention surgery (RP) or TURP, but mentions "prostatamateriaalia" (prostate material) taken in one go, maybe it's a biopsy. Alternatively, if "ajetaan" refers to TURP, which involves cutting, but I'm not certain. Wait, TURP is a procedure where tissue is removed, but the term here is "ajetaan," which could mean "flushed" or "pushed." Maybe it's a biopsy. Let's go with "biopsy" for now, but I need to confirm.

2. **Malignancy**: The text says "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" (no conclusive conclusion can be drawn) due to cautery artifacts ("polttoartefaktat") hindering reliable examination. So, they can't confirm if there's malignancy. But the options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe the answer is "NA". But wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the artifacts prevent reliable assessment, then the answer isn't clear. The report mentions "jonkin verran tulehdusta" (some inflammation) but no mention of cancer. Since they can't make a conclusive statement, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because there's no evidence of malignancy, but the correct approach here is to mark it as "NA" because the assessment was inconclusive. So "NA" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA". Since the malignancy is inconclusive (NA), then Gleason should also be "NA". Even if there were some findings, if the conclusion is inconclusive, Gleason isn't reported. So "NA" here.

Wait, but the instructions say "vain pahimman leesion tulokset" (only the worst lesion results) and "ei sisäkkäisiä rakenteita" (no nested structures). But in this case, the report says they can't make a conclusion due to artifacts. So malignancy is NA, hence Gleason is NA. Sample type: the term "prostatamateriaalia" taken in one go. If it's a biopsy, then "biopsy". But sometimes TURP samples are also referred to as chips. The phrase "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might refer to TURP, where tissue is resected in pieces. Wait, TURP is a procedure where the prostate is cut into pieces and removed. If the sample is "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" (pushed once?), maybe it's a TURP. Alternatively, biopsy samples are usually cores. The weight here is "vähän yli tusinasta grammasta" (a bit over a dozen grams). That's quite a lot for a biopsy, which is usually a few grams. TURP specimens can be more substantial. So maybe the sample type is TURP. For example, TURP specimens can weigh around 10-20 grams. So "TURP" would be the sample type here. So changing my initial thought from biopsy to TURP.

So final answers:

1. Sample type: TURP
2. Malignancy: NA (inconclusive)
3. Gleason: NA
