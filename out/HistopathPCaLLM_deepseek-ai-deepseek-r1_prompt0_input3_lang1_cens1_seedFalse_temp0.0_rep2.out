Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to fill are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" translates to something like "run at once" or "processed in one go." But I'm not sure if that refers to the sample type. The primary sample is prostate material. However, the specific terms biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't mentioned. TURP is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed, often for benign enlargement. But since the sample is just prostate material without specifying the procedure, maybe it's a biopsy? Wait, but the user allows NA if not specified. Since the report doesn't clearly state the procedure type, I should go with NA here.

2. **Malignancy Presence**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "polttoartefaktat estävät näytemateriaalin luotettavan tarkastelun. Siispä mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää tästä ajosta." So, burning artifacts prevent reliable examination, and no conclusive findings can be made. Since they can't determine conclusively, but there's mention of some inflammation but no clear malignancy, maybe the answer is "ei" (no)? Wait, but the presence of malignancy is unclear. The user's instruction says if there are no malignant findings, then "ei". But here, the examination is unreliable, so maybe it's NA? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't say it's absent. However, the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. Since the artifacts prevent reliable assessment, maybe the presence of malignancy can't be determined, so NA? But the options for malignancy are only yes, no, or NA. Since the report states that no conclusive results can be drawn, the correct answer here would be NA.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the presence of malignancy is NA (as per previous answer), the Gleason grade should also be NA. Even if there were some suspicion, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy NA, Gleason NA. But wait, let me double-check the sample type. The primary sample is prostate material, but the exact type isn't specified. The user allows NA if not determined. So yes, all three fields are NA.

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "NA",
  "3": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Näytteen alkuperäistä tyyppiä (biopsy/RP/TURP) ei mainita suoraan raportissa.  
2. Raportissa todetaan polttoartefaktien haittaavan luotettavaa arviointia, eikä konklusiivisia löydöksiä voida tehdä → ei voida vahvistaa pahanlaatuisuutta.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei raportoida, koska pahanlaatuisuutta ei voitu arvioida (ei löydöksiä/ei luotettavaa tulkintaa).
