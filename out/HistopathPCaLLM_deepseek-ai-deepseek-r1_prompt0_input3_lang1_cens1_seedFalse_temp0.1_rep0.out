Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" translates to something like "run in one go," which might refer to a procedure. However, the key here is "prostatamateriaalia" (prostate material) without specifying the procedure type. The report doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. So, the sample type isn't clear from the text. Therefore, I should put "NA" for the first field.

Next, presence of malignant findings. The text mentions "jonkin verran tulehdusta" (some inflammation) but states that cautery artifacts ("polttoartefaktat") prevent reliable examination. The conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis can be made. Since there's no mention of cancer cells or malignancy, and the artifacts hinder assessment, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is inadequate, maybe it's NA? Hmm. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample couldn't be assessed reliably, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The report says "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" (no conclusive conclusion can be drawn). So, they couldn't determine malignancy due to artifacts. In such cases, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the sample is insufficient, maybe "NA". But the options don't have an "inconclusive" choice. The user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since the report doesn't find any, even due to artifacts, the answer should be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA" if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. NA (sample type not specified)
2. ei (no malignancy found)
3. NA (no malignancy, so no Gleason)
