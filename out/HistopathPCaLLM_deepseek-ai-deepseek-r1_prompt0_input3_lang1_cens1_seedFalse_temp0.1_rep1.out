Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" translates to something like "run in one go," which might refer to a procedure. However, the key here is "prostatamateriaalia" (prostate material) without specifying the exact procedure. The report doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. So, the original type isn't clear, hence NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The text mentions "jonkin verran tulehdusta" (some inflammation) but states that cautery artifacts prevent reliable examination. The conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis can be made. Since there's no mention of cancer cells or malignancy, and the artifacts hinder assessment, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no evidence of malignancy found, but wait—actually, the report says they can't draw a conclusive result. Hmm. The question is whether there were malignant findings. If the sample is inadequate due to artifacts, maybe the answer is NA? But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but also can't exclude it due to artifacts, maybe NA is appropriate here. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they couldn't assess reliably, then technically, the presence is unknown. But the options don't have "ei tietoa", only "kyllä", "ei", or NA. So perhaps NA is correct here. But the user might expect "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the text says they can't conclude. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again: "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" – no conclusive findings. So, the presence of malignancy isn't determined. Therefore, the answer should be NA. But the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. So if the sample is inadequate, and no malignancy is found, but they can't confirm, maybe NA is correct. Alternatively, if no malignancy is detected in the sample, even if inconclusive, maybe "ei". But the report doesn't state any malignant cells found. So perhaps "ei" is the answer. Wait, but the presence of malignancy is unclear due to artifacts. So the correct answer here is NA because the assessment couldn't be reliably made. So for question 2, NA.

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported (or inconclusive), the Gleason should be NA. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. So here, NA.

So the final structured data would be:
1. NA (sample type not specified)
2. NA (inconclusive due to artifacts)
3. NA (no malignancy found or inconclusive)
