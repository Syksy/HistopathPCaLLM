Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The key term here is "ajetaan yhdellä kerral", which translates to "driven in one go" or possibly refers to a procedure. However, the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's not clear, maybe the answer here is "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Siispä mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää tästä ajosta." which means no conclusive findings can be drawn due to artifacts. So, there's no mention of malignancy, but it's unclear. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample couldn't be reliably examined, the answer might be "NA" instead of "ei" because they couldn't confirm either way.

Lastly, Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported and the examination was inconclusive, the Gleason score would be "NA".

So, compiling the answers:
1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: NA (inconclusive)
3. Gleason: NA
