Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to understand the three fields they want: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade. The allowed values for each are specified, so I have to make sure the answers fit those exactly.

Looking at the sample type, the options are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "shaving material" and mentions setting it on eight cassettes. Shaving material might be from a TURP procedure, which is a common way to remove prostate tissue, especially in cases of BPH. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, the malignant tumor findings. The report states "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and the summary is "Benign prostate hyperplasia." Since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, the allowed values are in the format major+minor=sum, but since the report is benign, there's no Gleason score provided. Therefore, this should be "NA."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so the benign finding is the only one. The JSON should not have nested structures, so each answer is a top-level key.

Double-checking the original text: "shaving material" aligns with TURP, "no atypical" means no malignancy, and Gleason isn't applicable. All answers fit the allowed values. No typos in the JSON keys, and the values are correctly capitalized as per the allowed options.
