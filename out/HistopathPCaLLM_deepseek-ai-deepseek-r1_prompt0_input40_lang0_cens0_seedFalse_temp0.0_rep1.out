Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I know stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The shaving material weighs approx 8.9g, approx 5g set on eight cassettes." The term "shaving material" makes me think of TURP, as that procedure often involves removing tissue in pieces or shavings. So I'll go with TURP here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states, "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and the summary is "Benign prostate hyperplasia." Since there's no mention of malignancy and it explicitly says benign, the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the tumor is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. So this field should be "NA."

Putting it all together, the JSON should have TURP for sample type, no for malignancy, and NA for Gleason. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without any nested structures. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of biopsy or RP. Yep, "shaving material" aligns with TURP. All right, that's it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
