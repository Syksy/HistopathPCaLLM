Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to identify the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "Höyläysmateriaali", which translates to "shaving material". But I need to map this to the allowed terms. "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which is a procedure where tissue is shaved off. So "Höyläysmateriaali" likely corresponds to TURP. So the first answer should be "TURP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia", which means benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of malignancy, atypia, or invasive growth. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason score, since the findings are benign, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grading because there's no cancer detected.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion considered. Since there's no malignancy, all fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the terms and the logic. Yes, everything seems to align. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA.
