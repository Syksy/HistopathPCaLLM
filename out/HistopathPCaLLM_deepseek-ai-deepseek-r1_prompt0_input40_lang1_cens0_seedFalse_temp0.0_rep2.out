Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields. Let me first understand the requirements clearly.

First, the three fields are:
1. Original sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA)
2. Presence of malignant findings (kyllä, ei, NA)
3. Reported Gleason grade in "major+minor=sum" format or NA if benign.

The input text is in Finnish, so I need to parse that. Let's look at the provided example answer to see how it's structured. The sample answer had "NA" for Gleason because it was benign. 

Now, the given lausunto (report) is: "Höyläysmateriaali painaa noin 8.9g ja noin 5 g laitettu kahdeksalle kasetille. Histologisesti nähdään hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota. Atypiaa tai invasiivista kasvavaa epiteelia ei näy. YHTEENVETO: Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia."

Translating key parts: "Höyläysmateriaali" probably refers to TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) material. The weight is given, and it's put into cassettes. Histologically, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. No atypia or invasive growing epithelium. Summary: Benign prostatic hyperplasia.

So for the first field, sample type. The term "höyläysmateriaali" is key. TURP is a common procedure where tissue is shaved off, so "höyläys" (shaving) likely corresponds to TURP. So the answer here is "TURP".

Second field: Malignant findings? The report states no atypia or invasive growth, and the summary is benign. So "ei" (no).

Third field: Gleason grade. Since it's benign, Gleason isn't reported, so "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON without nested structures. The keys are in Finnish as per the example. Let me check the example again to ensure correct syntax. The example used "kyllä", "ei", "NA" correctly. So the JSON should be:

{
  "näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there are no typos in the keys. Also, confirm that "TURP" is the correct term for "höyläysmateriaali". Yes, TURP is the procedure where tissue is removed via a resectoscope, which fits "höyläys" (shaving). So that's correct. No malignancy, so Gleason is NA. All fields accounted for. Looks good.

```json
{
  "näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
