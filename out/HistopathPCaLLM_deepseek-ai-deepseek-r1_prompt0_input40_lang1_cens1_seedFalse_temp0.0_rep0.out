Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, terms like TURP usually refer to larger specimens, and RP is a surgical removal. Since the text doesn't specify TURP or RP, maybe it's a biopsy. But if there's uncertainty, maybe NA is safer. Wait, but the sample mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, which are often found in TURP specimens. Hmm, but the original text doesn't explicitly state TURP. The weight is 8.9g, which could be a TURP sample, but I'm not certain. The user might expect NA here if it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the mention of "kasetillista" (cassettes) is a clue. Biopsies are usually in cassettes, but so are other specimens. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the safest answer is NA since the text doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type.

Next, presence of malignancy. The allowed values are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, and says "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin. Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia." So there's a suspicion of something else, but no definitive malignancy is stated. The key here is whether there are any malignant findings. Hyperplasia and inflammation are benign. The phrase "ainakin" (at least) suggests these are the findings, but the possibility of something else requires further tests. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer should be "ei" (no), because the report doesn't state any malignant findings. Even though there's a mention of possible other things, until confirmed, it's not malignant. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some suspicion, unless malignancy is confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So here, definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA (since not clearly biopsy, RP, or TURP), malignancy "ei", Gleason NA. Wait, but maybe the sample type is TURP? Because 8.9g is a lot for a biopsy. Biopsies are usually smaller. TURP specimens can be several grams. So maybe the sample type is TURP. Let me check: TURP is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed, and the weight here is 8.9g. That's plausible. So changing sample type to TURP. Then the answer would be TURP, ei, NA. But the original text doesn't explicitly say TURP. However, in some cases, the weight can indicate the procedure. For example, a TURP specimen is typically between 5-20 grams. A biopsy would be much less. So 8.9g is more in line with TURP. So maybe the sample type is TURP. That makes sense. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.
