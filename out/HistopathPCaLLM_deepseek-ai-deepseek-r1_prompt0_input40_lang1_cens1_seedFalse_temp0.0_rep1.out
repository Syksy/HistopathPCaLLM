Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, terms like TURP usually refer to larger specimens, and RP is a surgical removal. Since the text doesn't specify TURP or RP, maybe it's a biopsy. But if there's uncertainty, maybe NA is safer. Wait, but the sample mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, which are often found in TURP specimens. Hmm, but TURP is usually for BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), and the text does mention hyperplasia. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The user might have to default to NA here because the text doesn't clearly state the procedure type. So, answer for 1 would be NA.

Second, presence of malignancy. The text says "Ainakin hyperplasiaa eturauhasessa ja ...... Ainakin inflammaatiota, mutta mahdollisesti jotain muutakin. Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia." There's mention of hyperplasia and inflammation, but no clear indication of malignancy like carcinoma. The phrase "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else) suggests uncertainty, but it's not confirmed. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer (e.g., adenocarcinoma), the answer here should be "ei" (no). However, the need for further tests ("Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia") might imply suspicion, but according to the rules, unless malignancy is confirmed, it's "ei". So, answer 2 is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some suspicion, unless cancer is confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So, answer 3 is "NA".

Wait, but let me double-check. The original text doesn't mention any carcinoma or Gleason scoring. So yes, Gleason is NA. The sample type is unclear; the weight is 8.9g, which could be a TURP specimen (as TURP specimens are usually larger than biopsies). Biopsies are typically smaller. A TURP specimen can weigh around 6-10 grams sometimes. So maybe the sample type is TURP. But the text doesn't explicitly state "TURP". The user instructions say to derive from the text. If the text doesn't mention the procedure, should we infer based on the weight? The problem is that the user might expect us to use only explicit mentions. Since it's not stated, maybe NA is safer. But in real practice, 8.9g would be a TURP. However, the user's allowed values are strict. If the text doesn't say TURP, RP, or biopsy, then NA. So, sample type is NA.

So final answers:

1. NA

2. ei

3. NA
