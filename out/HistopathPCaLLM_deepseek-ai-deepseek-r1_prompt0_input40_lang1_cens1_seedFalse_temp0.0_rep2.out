Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, terms like TURP usually refer to larger specimens, and RP is a surgical removal. Since the text doesn't specify TURP or RP, maybe it's a biopsy. But if there's uncertainty, maybe NA is safer. Wait, but the sample mentions hyperplasia and inflammation, which are often found in TURP specimens. Hmm, but the original text doesn't explicitly state TURP. The weight is 8.9g, which could be a TURP sample, but I'm not certain. The user might expect NA here if it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the mention of "kasetillista" (cassettes) is a clue. Biopsies are usually in cassettes, but so are other specimens. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me check again. The original text doesn't mention any specific procedure like TURP or RP, so maybe the answer is NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "ainakin hyperplasiaa" (at least hyperplasia) and "inflammaatiota" (inflammation), but also mentions "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else) and "vaatii jatkotutkimuksia" (requires further investigation). So, there's no clear mention of cancer. Hyperplasia and inflammation are benign. The "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" is vague and not a definitive malignancy. Therefore, the answer here should be "ei" (no), since no malignancy is confirmed. But wait, the user wants the presence of malignant findings. If there's uncertainty, but no definitive diagnosis, then "ei" is correct. The report doesn't state cancer, so "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there's a suspicion, until confirmed, it's not reported. So, NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA (since procedure isn't specified), malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
