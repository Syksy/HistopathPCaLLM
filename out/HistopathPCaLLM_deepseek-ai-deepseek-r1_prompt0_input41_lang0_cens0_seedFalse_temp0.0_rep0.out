Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." The key term here is "biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." That clearly indicates no malignancy, so the answer here is "no."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no cancer detected, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. So, "NA" is the correct value here.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no cancer found, so there's no need to prioritize any lesions. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting. Let me double-check the input text again to confirm there's no mention of any other procedures like RP or TURP. The samples are definitely biopsies. All right, everything seems to line up. The final JSON should have the three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
