Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." The term "samples collected" typically refers to a biopsy procedure, where multiple samples are taken from different areas. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the sample type here is likely "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report states, "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This indicates uncertainty. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, the answer here should be "no". Even though they can't rule it out completely, the absence of confirmed cancer means "no" is appropriate. If it were suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "NA", but the instruction says "NA" is for benign. Wait, the allowed values for malignant findings are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report is uncertain, perhaps "NA" is better? But the user says "NA" is for benign. Wait, the third question's note says "NA" for benign. But the second question's allowed values include "NA". The user's instruction says: for the second question, "NA" is allowed. The statement says it's hard to determine cancer changes. So maybe the presence of malignancy is uncertain. But the user wants only the most severe lesion's results. If there's no confirmed malignancy, then "no" might be correct. Alternatively, if the pathologist can't determine, maybe "NA" is better. Hmm. The original instruction says: "Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." The samples mention chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, which are benign. The uncertainty is about cancer, but no cancer is found. So the most severe finding is benign, hence malignant tumor findings would be "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since there's no confirmed malignancy, this should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid with no nested structures. So the final answer should be a JSON object with those three keys and values.

  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
