Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet 1-6 ovat edustavia systemaattisia biopsioita..." The key word here is "biopsioita," which is Finnish for biopsies. So the original type is biopsy.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista." Translating that, it means "Prostate cancer does not appear in the material." So there are no malignant findings. The answer here should be "ei."

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no cancer detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So the third field is NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "biopsioita" is plural for biopsies, so the type is biopsy. The absence of cancer is clearly stated. Gleason isn't mentioned because there's no malignancy. All fields fit the allowed values. No issues here.
