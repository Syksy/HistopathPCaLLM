Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet kerätty vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta eturauhasesta." This translates to samples taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate. The method of collection isn't explicitly mentioned. Biopsy is a common way to take samples from specific lobes, but RP and TURP are surgical procedures. Since the text doesn't mention surgery, but just that samples were collected, it's likely a biopsy. However, the term used is "näytteet kerätty" which is "samples collected," which is a bit vague. But without mention of surgery, I'll go with biopsy.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia." Translating to "It's difficult to say if there are cancer-related changes in the sample." So the pathologist is uncertain. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's uncertain, maybe the answer should be NA? But the options are only yes, no, or NA. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't clearly state it's absent. The other findings mentioned are chronic inflammation and atrophy, which are benign. The uncertainty suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe the answer is "ei" (no)? Wait, but the presence of malignancy is about whether malignant findings were found. If it's uncertain, perhaps the answer is NA. Because the pathologist can't confirm either way. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they can't say, then maybe NA is appropriate here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers, or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is uncertain or not confirmed, and if the answer to the second question is NA or "ei", then Gleason would be NA. If there's no malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So in this case, since the presence is uncertain (NA) or negative (ei), Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: biopsy, because samples were taken from prostate lobes without mention of surgery.
2. Malignant findings: NA, because the report states uncertainty.
3. Gleason: NA, as no malignancy is confirmed.

Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. The text mentions "kahdessa näytteessä atrofioituneita rauhasia ja kroonista inflammaatiota" (in two samples, atrophic glands and chronic inflammation) and in one sample a bit of chronic inflammation. No mention of cancer, just uncertainty. So the worst finding here is benign changes with uncertainty. Therefore, malignant findings would be "ei" (no), but the report says it's hard to tell. Hmm, this is a bit conflicting. If the pathologist can't confirm, maybe the presence is NA. But the options are strict. Let me check the original text again. The key phrase is "Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia." So they can't say if there are cancer-related changes. That means the presence isn't confirmed, so maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because no definitive malignant findings are reported. But the uncertainty complicates things. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – if there's uncertainty, perhaps it's better to mark as NA. Because the presence isn't definitively yes or no. So in this case, since it's unclear, NA is the safest choice.

So final answers:

1. "biopsy" (since samples were taken, likely biopsy)
2. "NA" (uncertain presence)
3. "NA" (no malignancy confirmed)
