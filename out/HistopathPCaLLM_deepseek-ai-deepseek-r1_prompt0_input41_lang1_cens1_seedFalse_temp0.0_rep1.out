Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet kerätty vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta eturauhasesta." This translates to samples taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate. The method of collection isn't explicitly mentioned. Biopsy is a common way to collect samples from specific lobes, but RP and TURP are surgical procedures. Since the text doesn't mention surgery, but just that samples were taken, it's more likely a biopsy. However, the report doesn't explicitly state "biopsy," so maybe I should be cautious. But in medical contexts, when samples are taken from different lobes without specifying surgery, biopsy is the usual method. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The text says: "Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia." Translating to: "It's difficult to say if there are cancer-related changes in the sample." So the pathologist is uncertain. The other findings mention chronic inflammation and atrophy, which are benign. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, but also uncertainty, the answer here might be "ei" (no) because there's no clear indication. However, the uncertainty could lead to NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report says it's hard to tell, maybe they can't confirm malignancy, so the answer is "ei" because there's no positive identification. Alternatively, if the uncertainty means it's not determined, maybe NA. But the options are only yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, and mentions only benign changes, the answer should be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers, or NA if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there was uncertainty, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: biopsy (since samples were taken from lobes, likely biopsy)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no malignancy confirmed)
3. Gleason: NA
