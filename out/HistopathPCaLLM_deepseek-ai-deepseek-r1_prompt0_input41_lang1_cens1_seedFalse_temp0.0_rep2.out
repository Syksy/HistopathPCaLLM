Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet kerätty vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta eturauhasesta." The key word here is "kerätty" which means collected. Since it mentions samples taken from the left and right lobes, but doesn't specify the procedure. Biopsy is when samples are taken, whereas RP and TURP are specific procedures. Since it's not clear, maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia." Translating that: "It's difficult to say if there are cancer-related changes in the sample." So the report is uncertain. The question is, does uncertainty count as "ei" (no) or NA? Since the presence isn't confirmed, maybe the answer here is "ei" because they can't confirm malignancy, but the user might expect "NA" for uncertain. Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. If the report says it's hard to tell, maybe the answer is NA because it's not definitively yes or no. But the user's instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. However, in this case, there's no clear malignancy mentioned. The other findings are chronic inflammation and atrophy, which are benign. So maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy found, even though there's uncertainty. Hmm, tricky. I need to check if "ei" is for confirmed absence, but here it's uncertain. Maybe NA is more appropriate here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence of cancer is uncertain and there's no mention of Gleason scoring, the answer here should be NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignancy: NA (because it's uncertain)
3. Gleason: NA (no malignancy confirmed)

Wait, but the user said to take into account the worst lesion's results. The text mentions "vaikea sanoa" (hard to say) about cancer-related changes, but other findings are benign. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because there's no confirmed cancer. But the uncertainty complicates things. The user's instructions might prefer "ei" if no malignancy is found, even if uncertain. Alternatively, if the report is inconclusive, maybe NA is better. I need to decide based on typical medical reporting. If the pathologist can't confirm malignancy, it's usually reported as negative unless there's a suspicion. But the answer options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report says it's hard to tell, maybe NA is correct here. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The text says "kahdessa näytteessä atrofioituneita rauhasia ja kroonista inflammaatiota" which are benign changes, and "vaikea sanoa" about cancer. So no definitive cancer found, hence malignancy is "ei". But the uncertainty might mean it's NA. Hmm. Maybe the answer is "ei" because the report doesn't confirm cancer, even with uncertainty. Or maybe NA because the presence is uncertain. The user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If the worst lesion is benign, then malignancy is "ei". But if there's a lesion that's uncertain, maybe it's NA. This is a bit ambiguous. I'll go with "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy, and the other findings are benign. So:

1. NA
2. ei
3. NA
