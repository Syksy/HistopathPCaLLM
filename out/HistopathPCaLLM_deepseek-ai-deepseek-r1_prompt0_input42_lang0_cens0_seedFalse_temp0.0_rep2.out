Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g investigated." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so "RP" is the correct value here. 

Next, check for malignant tumor findings. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "Gleason 3". Gleason grades are used to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, with higher grades indicating more aggressive tumors. Since both grades 3 and 4 are mentioned, this confirms malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The summary states "score 7 (4+3)". The major grade is 4, minor is 3, summing to 7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions mostly grade 4 with a small amount of grade 3, which aligns with the summary of 4+3=7. There's no mention of a higher grade, so this is the most severe.

Finally, structure the JSON without nested elements. All values are correctly identified and formatted as per the allowed options. No "NA" needed here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```
