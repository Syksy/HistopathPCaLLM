Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "prostate sample" is a bit vague. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. Since the sample type isn't clearly stated, I should go with NA here.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." Since they can't determine if it's cancer (malignant) or inflammation (benign), there's no confirmation of malignancy. So the answer here should be no, because if it's uncertain, we can't say yes. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report is inconclusive, maybe NA is more appropriate. Hmm, the user's instructions say "NA" for the Gleason grade if benign, but for the malignant findings, if it's uncertain, maybe NA is better. Let me check the exact wording. The third field's NA is for benign, but the second field's NA is allowed. The statement says they can't determine cancer or inflammation. So it's not confirmed as malignant. So maybe the answer is no? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user might consider "no" only when it's confirmed benign. Since the report is inconclusive, perhaps NA is better. But I need to be careful here. The user's instruction says "malignant tumor findings" – if the report is uncertain, then there's no clear finding of malignancy, so maybe "no". But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. If the pathologist can't determine if it's cancer or inflammation, then the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed. So "no" would mean no malignancy found, but in reality, it's uncertain. However, the allowed values don't have an "uncertain" option. The options are yes, no, or NA. So perhaps NA is the correct choice here because the information isn't available or conclusive. But the user might expect "no" if malignancy isn't confirmed. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check similar examples. If the report says "cannot determine cancer," does that count as "no" or NA? Since the user wants the most severe lesion's result, and if the findings are mixed but inconclusive, maybe "no" is safer. Wait, the sample says "mixed findings can be observed in small parts" but they can't determine cancer. So the conclusion is that malignancy isn't identified, hence "no". So I'll go with "no" for the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the second field is "no" (benign), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there were some lesions, since they can't confirm malignancy, there's no Gleason grade reported. So NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings no, Gleason grade NA. Let me double-check. The sample type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA. Malignant findings are inconclusive, but since they can't confirm cancer, answer is no. Gleason grade is NA because no malignancy. That seems right.
