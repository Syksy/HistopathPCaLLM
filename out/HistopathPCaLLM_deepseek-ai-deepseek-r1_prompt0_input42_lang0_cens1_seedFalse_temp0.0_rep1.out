Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "prostate sample" is a bit vague. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. Since the sample type isn't clearly stated, I should go with NA here.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." Since they can't determine if it's cancer (malignant) or inflammation (benign), there's no confirmation of malignancy. So the answer here should be no, because if it's uncertain, we can't say yes. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report is inconclusive, maybe NA is more appropriate. Hmm, the user's instructions say "NA" for the Gleason grade if benign, but for the malignant findings, if it's uncertain, maybe NA is better. Let me check the exact wording. The third field's NA is for benign, but the second field's NA is allowed. The statement says they can't determine cancer or inflammation. So it's not confirmed as malignant. So maybe the answer is no? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user might consider "no" only when it's confirmed benign. Since the report is uncertain, perhaps NA is better here. But I need to be careful. Let me think again. The question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If the report can't determine it, then the answer isn't yes, but it's not a clear no either. So NA would be the safest choice here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers, or NA if benign. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (as per the second point), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, but in this case, there's no mention of any Gleason score. The statement doesn't talk about grades, so definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the second point: if the report can't determine if it's cancer or inflammation, does that mean malignant findings are not present? Or is it inconclusive? The user's instruction says "NA" is allowed for the second field. If the report is inconclusive, then NA makes sense. If the report says no malignancy found, then it's "no". But here, they can't determine, so it's not a definitive no. Therefore, NA is correct for the second field.

So the final JSON should be:
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
