Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "prostate sample" is a bit vague. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. Since the sample type isn't clearly stated, I should go with NA here.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." Since they can't determine if it's cancer (malignant) or inflammation (benign), there's no confirmation of malignancy. So the answer here should be no, because if it's uncertain, we can't say yes. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report is inconclusive, maybe NA is more appropriate. Hmm, the user's instructions say "NA" for the Gleason grade if benign, but for the malignant findings, if it's uncertain, maybe NA is better. Let me check again. The statement says they can't determine if it's cancer or inflammation. So the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed, so the answer should be no? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user might consider "no" only when it's confirmed benign, and NA when it's uncertain. Since the text says it's undetermined, maybe NA is correct here. But I need to be careful. Let me think. If the report can't determine malignancy, then the answer isn't a clear yes or no. So NA would be appropriate for the malignant findings field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (as per the previous field), the Gleason grade should be NA. Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, but in this case, there's no mention of any Gleason score because the diagnosis is uncertain. So definitely NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Wait, but the user said "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." However, in this case, there's no mention of any lesions, just mixed findings where they can't determine cancer or inflammation. So there's no severe lesion identified. Therefore, all fields would be NA. Let me confirm again. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. Malignant findings are undetermined, so NA. Gleason grade isn't applicable, so NA. That seems right.
