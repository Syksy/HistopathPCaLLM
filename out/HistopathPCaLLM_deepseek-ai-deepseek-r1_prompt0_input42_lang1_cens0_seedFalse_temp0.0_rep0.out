Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan..." The term "prostatektomia" refers to a prostatectomy, which is RP. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Gleason 4" and "Gleason 3", which are both cancer grades. The presence of Gleason scores indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. The summary says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)", so major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The correct format is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. Here, the primary pattern is 4, secondary 3, which is the worst in this case. So the Gleason is correctly 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
