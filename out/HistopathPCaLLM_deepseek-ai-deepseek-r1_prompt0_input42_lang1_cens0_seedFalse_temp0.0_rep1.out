Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan..." The term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "Gleason 4" and "Gleason 3", which are both cancer grades. The presence of any Gleason pattern (except maybe benign ones) indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the summary says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". The format required is "major+minor=sum". The major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Also, only the worst lesion is considered. Here, the primary pattern is 4 and secondary is 3, which is the worst in this case. So the structured data should be correct.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
