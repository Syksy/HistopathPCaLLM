Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to process a histopathological report from prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields. Let me break down the requirements first.

First, the original sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaattia", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so that's probably "RP". So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report talks about Gleason grades 4 and 3, which are indicators of cancer. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The summary says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)", so major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. So the value here is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions mostly Gleason 4 with a small amount of Gleason 3, which aligns with 4+3=7. The sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy, so RP. Malignant findings are present. All criteria seem met. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes. Yep, looks right. Now, structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
