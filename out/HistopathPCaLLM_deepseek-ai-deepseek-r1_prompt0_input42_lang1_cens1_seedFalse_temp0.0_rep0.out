Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me break down each field and the given text to see what's relevant.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text starts with "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?." The word "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. Now, I need to determine which type it is. Biopsy is usually a small sample taken for testing. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the entire prostate. TURP is transurethral resection of the prostate, a procedure to remove part of the prostate. The text mentions the weight is about 8 grams. A normal prostate is around 20-30 grams, but after TURP, the removed tissue is usually less. However, a radical prostatectomy would remove the whole prostate, which would weigh more than 8 grams. Wait, but 8 grams seems low for a whole prostate. Maybe it's a TURP sample? Or perhaps the weight is a typo or unclear (there's a question mark after 8). The sample is called "prostatanäyte" without specifying the procedure. Since the options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA, and the text doesn't clearly state which procedure was done, maybe it's safer to put "NA" here. But wait, "prostatanäyte" could be a biopsy. However, the weight of 8 grams seems high for a biopsy, which is usually just a few grams. TURP samples can vary but might be around that. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. The user might expect "biopsy" if it's a needle biopsy, but the weight is confusing. Since the text isn't explicit, maybe "NA" is the right choice here.

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says "Sekalaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta. Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota." So, there are miscellaneous findings in small areas, but it's unclear if it's cancer (syöpää) or inflammation. Since they can't determine malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" because there's no confirmation of malignancy. Wait, but "ei" means "no", but the report says they can't determine. So maybe "NA"? Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If they can't determine, then the answer isn't yes, but it's not a clear no either. However, the allowed options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states that malignancy can't be confirmed, it's not a definite "ei" (no), but the presence isn't confirmed either. In medical terms, if the report is uncertain, it's not classified as malignant. So maybe "ei" is correct here. Alternatively, "NA" if the information isn't available. But the report does mention that they can't determine, so perhaps "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. I think "ei" is the right choice here.

Third, the reported Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA". Since the second field is "ei" (no malignancy), the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there were some findings, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. So this would be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified clearly)
2. Malignant findings: ei
3. Gleason: NA

Wait, but let me double-check the sample type. The text says "prostatanäyte" (prostate sample) with a weight of about 8 grams. A biopsy is usually multiple small cores, total weight maybe a few grams. TURP samples can be around 6-10 grams sometimes. RP would be the whole prostate, which is heavier. So 8 grams is more likely a TURP. But the user's allowed values include TURP. So maybe the sample type is TURP. But the original text doesn't mention the procedure, just the sample. However, in some contexts, the weight might indicate TURP. But since the user instructions say to extract from the text, and the text doesn't specify the procedure, maybe it's safer to put "NA". Alternatively, if the weight is a clue, perhaps TURP. But I'm not sure. The question mark after 8 might indicate uncertainty in the weight. So maybe the original sample type is unclear, hence "NA".

So final answers:
1. "NA"
2. "ei"
3. "NA"
