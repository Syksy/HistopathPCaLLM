Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report from prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatanäyte" which translates to prostate sample. But the specific type isn't clear. It says "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?" – preparing a prostate sample weighing about 8? Maybe grams? Since there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I can't be sure. So the answer here would be NA.

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The report states "Sekalaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta. Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota." So they found some findings in small areas but can't determine if it's cancer (syöpää) or inflammation. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed as malignant. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. If the report is uncertain, does that count as "ei" or NA? The question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – malignant findings. If they can't determine, then technically there's no confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers, or NA if benign. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. 

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion is considered. The input doesn't mention any lesions with confirmed cancer, so all fields should be NA or "ei" as appropriate.

  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
