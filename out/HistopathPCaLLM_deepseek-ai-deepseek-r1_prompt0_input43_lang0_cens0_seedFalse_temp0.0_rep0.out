Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples." Chippings usually come from a TURP procedure, which is a transurethral resection of the prostate. So the sample type here should be TURP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. TURP fits here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." Since adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here is "no." The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. So "no" is correct.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no malignancy detected. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward here. Also, the user specified to take the most severe lesion, but since there's no malignancy, all answers are based on that. Let me double-check each part again to confirm. Yep, looks right. The JSON should be valid with the three keys and the corresponding values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
