Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "samples." TURP often results in chippings, so I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma," so the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. I need to make sure not to include any nested structures and only take the most severe lesion into account, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so that's straightforward. Putting it all together into a valid JSON without any extra nesting.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
