Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." The mention of cassettes and jar might indicate a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, terms like TURP usually involve resection chips, and RP is a whole prostate. Since the sample is 30g, which is less than a typical prostate (which is about 20-30g normally, but RP would be the whole gland). Wait, maybe 30g is the sample received, but the description says "mostly ordinary prostate tissue" and "isolated atrophied glands." This could be a TURP sample, which is often fragmented. Alternatively, if it's a biopsy, they usually have multiple cores. The report doesn't specify TURP chips or biopsy cores. The term "approx 30g" might suggest a TURP, as biopsies are usually smaller. But I'm not 100% certain. If unsure, maybe NA is safer. But let me think again. TURP samples are usually multiple chips, and the weight can vary. A 30g sample could be a TURP. Alternatively, if it's a biopsy, 30g seems too heavy. So maybe TURP? But the user might expect "biopsy" if it's a small sample. Wait, no, TURP is a procedure where they remove parts of the prostate, so the sample would be more than a biopsy. Since the weight is 30g, which is significant, it's more likely TURP. So original sample type would be TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." The key part here is "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So the report is inconclusive. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since they can't confirm malignancy, it's not "yes." But is it "no" or "NA"? If they didn't find any malignancy but the report is uncertain, maybe "no" if they explicitly state no malignancy, but here it's "no decision," which is inconclusive. The user's instruction says "NA" is allowed. So in this case, since the report doesn't confirm or deny, maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the question is "Were there malignant tumor findings?" If they can't reach a decision, then the answer isn't yes or no, so "NA" makes sense.

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason score or grades. Since there's no mention of cancer, the Gleason grade would be "NA" as per the instructions.

So putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Let me double-check. Original sample type: TURP because of the 30g weight, which aligns with TURP samples. Malignant findings: NA because the report is inconclusive. Gleason: NA because no cancer found or mentioned.
