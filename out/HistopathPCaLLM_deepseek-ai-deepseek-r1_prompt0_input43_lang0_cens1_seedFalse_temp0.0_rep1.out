Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." The mention of cassettes and jar might indicate a surgical specimen. TURP usually refers to chips from the procedure, but the weight here is 30g. A radical prostatectomy (RP) typically removes the entire prostate, which is about 30-40 grams, so this might be an RP. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, it could be a TURP if the weight is lower, but 30g is on the higher side. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention TURP or biopsy. Since the sample is 30g, which is closer to an RP, but I'm not certain. Maybe the safest answer here is "NA" if it's not explicitly stated. Wait, but the user expects one of the allowed values. Let me check again. The sample is "prostate samples" and the weight is 30g. RP usually removes the whole prostate, which is around that weight. So I think the original sample type here is RP. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects NA if it's not explicitly stated. Hmm. The instructions say to use the allowed values. The statement doesn't explicitly say biopsy, RP, or TURP, so maybe the answer should be NA. But sometimes in pathology reports, the sample type is inferred. For example, if it's a TURP, the weight might be less, but 30g is possible. Alternatively, maybe the sample is from a prostatectomy. But without explicit mention, perhaps NA is better. I'll go with NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states: "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So they didn't find definitive cancer, but also couldn't rule it out. The key phrase is "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So does that mean the presence is uncertain? The question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they can't make a decision, it's not confirmed. So the answer here would be "no" because there's no positive identification of malignancy. Alternatively, if it's indeterminate, maybe NA. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if it's not found, then "no". But if the report says they can't determine, maybe NA. Wait, the example given in the problem: if the report says "no decision... can be reached", does that count as "no" or "NA"? Since the pathologist couldn't confirm, maybe "no" because there's no positive finding. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me think. If the report explicitly states no malignancy, then "no". If it's uncertain, maybe "NA". But the allowed values don't have an uncertain option. The options are yes, no, or NA. So in this case, since they can't reach a decision, perhaps "NA" is appropriate. But the user might expect "no" if no malignancy is found. Wait, the report says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So it's not confirmed as malignant, but also not ruled out. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor is not determined, so "NA" would be the answer here. But I need to be careful. The question is "were there malignant tumor findings?" If the findings are inconclusive, then the answer isn't yes or no, so "NA". So I'll put "NA" for the second field.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as numbers or "NA" for benign. Since the report doesn't mention any cancer, and the malignant finding is NA, the Gleason grade should be "NA". So the third field is "NA".

Putting it all together: original sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. But wait, the sample type: the user might expect that "approx 30g prostate samples" is an RP. Let me check again. A typical prostate weighs about 20-30 grams. RP removes the entire prostate, so 30g would align with that. TURP usually removes smaller amounts, like 5-20 grams. So maybe the original sample type is RP. If that's the case, then the first field is "RP". But the report doesn't explicitly state RP. However, in some cases, the weight is a clue. If the user's allowed values include RP, and the weight is 30g, which is typical for RP, then maybe the answer is RP. But the problem is that the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned, so maybe the answer should be NA. But perhaps in practice, pathologists infer the sample type based on the weight. For example, a biopsy would be much smaller. So 30g is more likely RP. Therefore, original sample type is RP. Then, malignant findings: since they can't reach a decision, but no malignancy is found in the samples examined, maybe "no". Wait, the report says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So it's possible that there's a suspicion but not confirmed. In that case, the presence of malignant tumor is not confirmed, so "no" or "NA"? The allowed values are yes, no, NA. If the pathologist couldn't confirm, but didn't find any definite malignancy, then "no" might be appropriate. But if it's uncertain, maybe "NA". This is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the report states that malignancy was found. Since it says "no decision", it's not confirmed, so "no" might be the answer. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. If the report says "no decision", does that mean they can't say yes or no? Then "NA" would be correct. But if the default is "no" unless stated otherwise, then "no". The instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings". If the findings are inconclusive, then "NA" is better. So I'll go with "NA" for malignant findings. Then Gleason grade is "NA" as well.

So final structured data:

1. Original sample type: RP (based on weight)
2. Malignant tumor findings: NA (inconclusive)
3. Gleason grade: NA

But I need to confirm the sample type. If the sample is 30g, that's more consistent with RP. TURP is usually less. So I think sample type is RP. So the answer would be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}

But wait, the user might expect that if the sample type isn't explicitly stated, it's NA. But in practice, pathologists often infer based on the sample. For example, a biopsy is small, TURP is chips, RP is the whole gland. So 30g is likely RP. So I'll go with RP for sample type.
