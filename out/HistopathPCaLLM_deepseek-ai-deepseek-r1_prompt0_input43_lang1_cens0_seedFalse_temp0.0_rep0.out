Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja. Materiaali ajettiin kaseteissa A-H, purkissa jäljellä noin 15g." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically from a TURP procedure. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin," which means there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. The user specified that Gleason is only for malignant cases. 

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested objects. The allowed values are all accounted for. Let me double-check the terms to confirm. Yes, TURP is correct for the sample type. Malignancy is "ei" as no cancer was found. Gleason is NA. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
