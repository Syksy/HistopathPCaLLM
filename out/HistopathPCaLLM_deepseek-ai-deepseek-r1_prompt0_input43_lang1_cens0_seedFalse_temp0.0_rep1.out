Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja. Materiaali ajettiin kaseteissa A-H, purkissa jäljellä noin 15g." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically obtained from a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin," which means there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the allowed values. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: TURP. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. All look good. No typos in the keys. Should be ready to format into JSON.

```json
{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
```
