Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips or fragments, which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin," which means there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the presence of malignant findings is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions specify to use "NA" for benign cases. So the third field is "NA".

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. The allowed values are all accounted for. No typos in the keys. Confirming each part again: sample type TURP, malignancy ei, Gleason NA. That's all.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
