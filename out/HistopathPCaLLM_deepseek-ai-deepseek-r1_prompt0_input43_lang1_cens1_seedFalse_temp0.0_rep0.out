Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The mention of "prostatanäytteitä" (prostate samples) and the way they're processed (asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin – placed in cassettes and a jar) suggests this is a biopsy. RP and TURP are specific procedures, but the description here is more general, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia nähtävillä, ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Translating that: there are some atrophic glands visible, but no conclusions can be drawn about cancer-related changes. So, no malignant findings. The answer here should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, it's "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the sample type. Biopsy is correct because RP and TURP are specific surgical samples, and the description here is about taking samples, not surgical removal. The weight (30g) might be a bit high for a standard biopsy, but maybe it's multiple cores. The key is the processing method mentioned, which aligns with biopsy handling. 

Malignancy: The report explicitly states that no cancer-related changes were found, so "ei" is correct. Gleason is "NA" as there's no cancer. All fields accounted for, no nesting. Looks good.
