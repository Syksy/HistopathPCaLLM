Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me break down each field and see what information I can find in the given text.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text starts with "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä." Translating from Finnish, that's "About 30g of prostate samples." The term "näytteitä" means samples, which is a bit generic. Now, common prostate sample types include biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The mention of 30g might suggest a larger sample, like from a TURP procedure, which typically removes more tissue. Biopsies are usually smaller. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. But "asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin" translates to "placed in cassettes and a jar," which is standard for processing surgical specimens. TURP specimens are often multiple chips placed in cassettes. Since it's about 30g, which is a moderate amount, TURP is a possibility. But I'm not 100% sure. If there's uncertainty, maybe "NA" is safer. Wait, but the user expects us to choose from the allowed values. Let me think again. The sample is "prostatanäytteitä" without specifying, but the weight might hint. Biopsy samples are usually much smaller, like a few grams. RP is the entire prostate, which is heavier, around 30-50g maybe. But the text says "näytteitä" (samples) plural, which could mean multiple pieces, like TURP chips. TURP specimens are often multiple chips. So maybe TURP? But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the report doesn't specify the procedure, maybe "NA" is better. But the user might expect us to infer from context. Let's check again. The sample is 30g, which is a significant amount. A biopsy would be smaller. RP is the whole prostate, which could be around that weight. But the term "näytteitä" (samples) might not refer to the whole prostate. TURP is a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed, so 30g could fit. Hmm. Maybe the safest answer here is "TURP" because of the weight and the way the sample is processed into cassettes and a jar, which is typical for TURP specimens. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the original sample type isn't clearly stated, maybe "NA". But the user probably wants us to infer. Let's go with TURP.

Second, whether there are malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says "ei päästä johtopäätöksiä syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Translating: "no conclusions can be drawn about cancer-related changes." Also, "yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia" means "individual atrophic glands" which are benign. So the report is stating that there's no evidence of malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. Since there are no malignant findings, the allowed value is "NA". So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant findings "ei", Gleason "NA".
