Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." The key term here is "biopsies," so the original sample type should be "biopsy." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's straightforward.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The summary states, "Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." The current report says "nothing suspicious" and "no tumor tissue can be seen." So the current findings are negative for malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the current report indicates no tumor, the answer here should be "no."

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason score because there's no tumor found. The user specified that for benign statements, it should be NA. So Gleason grade is "NA."

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since there's no malignancy, there's no Gleason to report. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each field against the allowed values. Everything seems to fit. The answer should be a JSON with those three keys and the determined values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
