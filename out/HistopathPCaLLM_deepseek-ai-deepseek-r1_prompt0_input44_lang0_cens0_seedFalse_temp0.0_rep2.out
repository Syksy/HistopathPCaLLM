Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The summary says "now no tumor tissue can be seen," but it also notes that earlier biopsies had cancer. However, the current report indicates no malignancy, so the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, since there's no tumor found now, it should be "NA" as per the instructions. I need to make sure the JSON doesn't have nested structures and only includes the most severe lesion, which in this case is benign. All fields should be correctly formatted with the allowed values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
