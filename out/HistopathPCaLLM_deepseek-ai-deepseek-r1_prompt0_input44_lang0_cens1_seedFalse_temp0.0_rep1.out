Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." The term "samples" here is a bit generic. The note mentions "Earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," but the current report doesn't specify the sample type. Since the current report doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should go with NA here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The current report says "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." However, the note mentions prior biopsies with cancer. But the instruction says to consider only the most severe lesion from the current report. Since the current findings are inconclusive, the answer here should be "no" because the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy. Wait, but the note says earlier biopsies had cancer. But the task is to process the given statement, not prior reports. So the current report's conclusion is that they can't determine malignancy, so maybe "no" or "NA"? The allowed values are yes, no, NA. Since the current sample doesn't find malignancy, but the note is just a note, not part of the current findings. So the answer should be "no" because the current report doesn't confirm it. But the note says earlier biopsies had cancer. Hmm, but the user instruction says to use the most severe lesion from the provided raw data. The raw data here includes the note. Wait, the raw data is the entire statement provided. The note is part of the statement. So the current report's conclusion is that they can't conclude, but the note mentions prior cancer. However, the task is to report findings from the most severe lesion in the current sample. The current sample's findings are benign (no malignancy), even though there's a note about prior biopsies. So the answer for malignant tumor findings should be "no" because the current sample doesn't show malignancy. But maybe the note is part of the current report's context. Wait, the note is part of the current statement. So the current report is saying that in this sample, they can't find malignant changes, but they note that earlier biopsies did. However, the task is to report based on the current sample's findings. So the answer should be "no" because the current sample's conclusion is that they can't find malignancy. But the note is just additional info, not part of the current findings. So "no" is correct.

Third, Gleason grade. Since the current report doesn't mention any malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even though prior biopsies had cancer, the current sample doesn't, so no Gleason here.

So the structured data would be:
1. Original sample type: NA (since the statement doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant tumor findings: no (current sample inconclusive but no confirmation)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no malignancy found in current sample)
