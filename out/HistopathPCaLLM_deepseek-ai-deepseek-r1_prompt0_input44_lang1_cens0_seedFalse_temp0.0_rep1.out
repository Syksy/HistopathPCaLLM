Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line says "Edustavia prostatabiopsiota normaalimallin mukaan." The word "biopsiota" clearly refers to a biopsy. So the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report mentions "Ei mitään epäilyttävää" which translates to "Nothing suspicious." Also, it states that in previous biopsies there was prostate cancer, but now "nyt ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta" meaning no tumor tissue is seen. So the current sample doesn't have malignancy. The answer here is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" as integers, but only if malignant. Since the current sample is benign, the Gleason should be "NA". The previous findings of cancer are noted, but the instruction says to report only the worst lesion from the current sample, not past ones. So no Gleason here.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct without nested objects. All three fields are top-level. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatabiopsiota" is biopsy. The absence of malignancy is clear. Gleason is not applicable. So the final JSON should have the three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
