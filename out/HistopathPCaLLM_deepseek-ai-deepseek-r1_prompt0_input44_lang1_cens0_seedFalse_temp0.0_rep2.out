Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line says "Edustavia prostatabiopsiota normaalimallin mukaan." The word "biopsiota" clearly refers to a biopsy. So the first answer should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "Ei mitään epäilyttävää" which translates to "Nothing suspicious". Also, it states that previous biopsies found prostate cancer ("AIemmissa biopsioissa kyllä löydetty prostatasyöpää"), but now there's no tumor tissue seen ("nyt ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta"). So the current sample doesn't have malignant findings. The answer here is "ei".

For Gleason grade, the report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no malignancy detected in this sample. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So the third field is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatabiopsiota" is biopsy, "ei mitään epäilyttävää" and no tumor tissue now. Yep, all looks correct. No Gleason needed here. The JSON should be simple with those three keys and values.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
