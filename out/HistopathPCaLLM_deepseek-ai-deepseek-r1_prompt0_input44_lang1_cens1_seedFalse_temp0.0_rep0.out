Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytteitä" translates to prostate samples, but the exact type isn't specified here. However, there's a note: "Huom: Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää." This mentions previous biopsies, but the current sample isn't explicitly called a biopsy. The main sample might be a routine one, but since the note refers to past biopsies, maybe the current sample is also a biopsy? Wait, the original sample type refers to the current sample, not previous ones. The current report doesn't specify the type, so I should go with NA.

Next, the presence of malignancy. The text states: "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." This translates to "Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." But also, "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää" means previous biopsies reported cancer. However, the current sample doesn't show malignancy. The key here is whether the current sample has malignant findings. Since it says they can't determine any malignant changes, and there's no mention of malignancy in the current sample, the answer should be "ei" (no). Even though previous biopsies had cancer, the current sample doesn't, so "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". Since the current sample doesn't have malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The previous biopsies had cancer, but we're only considering the current sample's worst lesion. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA (since not specified), malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
