Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." That translates to "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." But the note says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää," which means "In previous biopsies, prostate cancer was reported." However, the current sample is described as "prostatanäytteitä" without specifying the procedure. The mention of previous biopsies doesn't necessarily mean the current sample is a biopsy. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the type (like TURP or RP), I might have to go with NA here.

Next, malignancy. The report states, "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." So, regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded. But there's a note about previous biopsies having cancer. However, the question is about the current sample. Since they can't determine malignancy here, does that mean "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says they can't conclude anything about malignant changes. So maybe "ei" if no malignancy is found, but here it's uncertain. Wait, the exact translation is "concerning malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." So it's not confirmed, but the current sample doesn't show malignancy. Or maybe the presence is uncertain. But the options are only yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't find malignancy, but mentions previous biopsies, but the current sample's conclusion is that they can't determine. Hmm. The key is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. The text says "ei voida päätellä mitään" which is "cannot conclude anything," which might mean that malignancy isn't identified here. So perhaps "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't show malignancy, even though previous biopsies did. But the question is about the presence in the sample, not the patient's history. So the answer here would be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. Since the current sample doesn't show malignancy (answer to 2 is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The previous biopsies had cancer, but the current sample doesn't, so no Gleason here.

Wait, but the note says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää." But the current sample's findings don't mention any malignancy. So the presence of malignancy in this sample is "ei", and Gleason is NA. The sample type isn't specified, so NA for that. Let me check again the original sample type. The text starts with "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytteitä" is just prostate samples. It doesn't specify if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type is NA.

So the structured data would be:

1. NA
2. ei
3. NA

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
