Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." The term "prostatectomy" here is key. Since it's a whole prostatectomy, that's typically referred to as a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type should be RP.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states there's a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "perineural invasion seen." Perineural invasion is often associated with malignancy. Additionally, the presence of a tumor focus and the mention of Gleason grading (which is used for cancer) indicate malignancy. So the answer here is yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report says "classes 3+4." In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) and secondary (minor) grades are added. Here, 3 and 4 sum to 7. So the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions a single tumor focus with Gleason 3+4, so that's the one to use. Other areas like seminal vesicles being clean don't affect this. Also, the sample type is clearly RP, not biopsy or TURP. The margins being negative and no metastases don't change the malignancy status here since the tumor is present.

Finally, structuring the JSON without nested structures. Each field is straightforward. No need for NA since all information is present. Double-checking allowed values and formatting to ensure compliance.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
