Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "A suspect prostate sample, processed according to the routine." There's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is just referred to as a suspect prostate sample. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says the structure is unclear and further inspection is needed. It mentions "negative marginals" and "no metastases," but doesn't explicitly state the presence of a malignant tumor. Since it's unclear and needs more inspection, I can't confirm malignancy. So the answer here is no, because there's no positive identification, but wait—maybe it's NA? Hmm. The report doesn't confirm malignancy but also doesn't say benign. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since it's unclear, maybe NA is better. But the options are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't find any malignancy but says further tests are needed, perhaps it's safer to put "no" because they didn't find any, but the structure is unclear. Wait, the presence of a tumor isn't confirmed. The sample is suspect, but the findings are negative for metastases, margins are negative, and seminal vesicles are clean. However, the focus is described with gland structures separated, but unclear. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy, maybe the answer is "no". But the user says to take the most severe lesion. However, the report doesn't mention a lesion as malignant. So maybe "no" is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. Since there's no mention of Gleason grading here, and if the malignant finding is "no" or NA, then the Gleason grade should be NA. The report doesn't provide any Gleason scores, so definitely NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Wait, but the sample is suspect. Does that affect the malignant findings? The user says to take the most severe lesion. The sample has a focus of fusing tissue, but the structure is unclear. Since no malignancy is confirmed, and the findings are negative, maybe malignant findings are "no". But if the pathologist couldn't determine because the structure is unclear, maybe it's NA. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the presence of malignancy is uncertain, then NA might be appropriate. However, the user instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" — if the report doesn't state any, then it's "no". But if the report is inconclusive, maybe NA. The statement says "However, the structure is unclear and not able to detect. Further inspection is needed." So they couldn't determine, hence no findings of malignancy. So "no" or NA? The answer depends on whether "no" is for confirmed absence, and NA for uncertain. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm either presence or absence, but is uncertain, then NA. But the user says to take the most severe lesion. Since the most severe lesion here is the fusing tissue focus, but it's unclear, maybe the answer is NA for malignant findings. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check again. The report says "no metastases seen in lymph nodes" and "negative marginals", but the main lesion is unclear. So the presence of a malignant tumor in the main lesion is uncertain. Therefore, malignant findings would be NA because it's not confirmed. But the user's allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't state any malignant findings, but the structure is unclear, perhaps the answer is NA. So I think for malignant tumor findings, the answer is NA. But I need to be careful. The user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". The most severe lesion here is the fusing tissue focus. The description says "most of gland structures and canals are separated" — does that indicate any Gleason pattern? Not necessarily. Since the structure is unclear and further inspection is needed, there's no definitive diagnosis. So malignant findings would be NA. Therefore, the answer for malignant tumor findings is NA. Then, the Gleason grade is NA as well. The original sample type is NA because it's not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. 

Wait, but the sample is a "prostate sample" — could that be a biopsy? The user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The term "sample" is generic. If it's a biopsy, the sample type would be biopsy. But the report doesn't specify. So NA is correct here. 

So final answers: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. But let me check again. The sample is from the middle (E, F, G) forming a fusing tissue focus. The processing is routine. The mention of sections O and P for seminal vesicles might suggest a TURP or RP, but without explicit terms, it's safer to put NA. 

So the structured JSON would be:

{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
