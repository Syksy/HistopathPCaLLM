Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since it's a complete prostatectomy, RP is the correct choice here. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor tissue focus. Also, there's a Gleason score reported as 3+4. Gleason scores are indicative of cancer, so malignancy is present. Therefore, the second field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "luokat 3+4". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. So the third field should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions Gleason 3 in "kudoksen gleason 3", but that's part of the perineural invasion description. The main tumor focus has 3+4, which is the primary and higher grade. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7.

Check for any other possible issues. The margins are negative, seminal vesicles clean, no metastases. Those don't affect the three fields required. All other info can be ignored as per the instructions.

Final check: sample type RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7. All values are correctly formatted and meet the allowed options.
