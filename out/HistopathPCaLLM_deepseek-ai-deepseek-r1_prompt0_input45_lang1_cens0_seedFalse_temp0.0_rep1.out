Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me start by understanding each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti", which translates to "entire prostatectomy specimen". RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so that's a match. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report talks about a "kasvainkudoksen fokus" (tumor tissue focus) and mentions Gleason grades. Since Gleason grading is for cancer, this indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA" if benign. The text says "luokat 3+4", which directly translates to grades 3 and 4. So the sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions a focus with 3+4, and another mention of "kudoksen gleason 3". But since 3+4 is the higher grade (sum 7 vs. 3), the worst is 3+4=7. Also, checking that there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Marginaalit negatiiviset and other info don't affect the required fields. Seminaalivesikkelit being clear and no metastases in lymph nodes are noted but not relevant here. So the final JSON should have the three fields correctly filled as per the analysis.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "3+4=7"
}
```
