Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of a prostate sample. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me start by reading through the provided report carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "Suspekti prostatanäyte, prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. The word "suspekti" suggests it's a biopsy taken due to suspicion, but the exact type isn't specified. The other terms like TURP or RP aren't mentioned here. So I might have to go with NA here since it's not clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report says "Negatiiviset marginaalit, kapseli ehjä. Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa." That translates to negative margins, intact capsule, no metastases in lymph nodes. However, the main part mentions "rakenne epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen. Tarkempaa tarkastelua vaaditaan." So the structure is unclear and difficult to interpret, requiring further examination. There's no explicit mention of cancer or malignancy. The focus described has glands and ducts separated, but it's unclear. Since there's no definitive malignant finding, but also not a clear benign diagnosis, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because there's no confirmed malignancy, or "NA" if the uncertainty affects it. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct. Wait, but the presence of "suurin osa rauhasrakenteista ja kanavista erillään" might suggest some architectural changes, but not necessarily cancer. Since the conclusion is unclear and needs more examination, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? The question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report doesn't state cancer, then "ei". But if it's uncertain, maybe NA. Hmm. The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report is inconclusive, perhaps the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, if the suspicious areas are considered possible but not confirmed, maybe NA. But the options don't have 'epävarma', so between 'ei' and 'NA'. Since the report doesn't state malignancy, but mentions suspicious sample, but the findings are unclear. Maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no definitive malignant findings reported. Or maybe NA because it's uncertain. The user might expect "ei" here, but I need to check the exact wording. The report says "Ei metastaaseja" (no metastases) but that's about metastases, not primary tumor. The main part is the focus with unclear structure. Since the pathologist isn't confirming cancer, just that it's difficult to interpret, perhaps the answer is "ei" for no malignant findings. But I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think again. The key is whether malignant findings are present. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, even if it's suspicious, the answer would be "ei". Unless the suspicion implies possible malignancy, but according to the instructions, only confirmed findings count. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. But wait, if there was a suspicion but no confirmation, maybe there's no Gleason reported. The report doesn't mention Gleason score, so the answer is NA.

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (since it's just a "prostatanäyte" without specifying biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings: "ei" (no)
3. Gleason: NA
