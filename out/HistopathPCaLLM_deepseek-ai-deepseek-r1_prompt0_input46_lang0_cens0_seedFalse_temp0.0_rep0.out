Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Shaved prostate chippings." I remember that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which typically results in chippings. So the sample type here should be TURP. Biopsy is usually needle samples, and RP is radical prostatectomy, which is the whole gland. So TURP fits here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report clearly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." That's a definite "no" for malignant findings. No ambiguity there.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there's no cancer detected, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The allowed value here is "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were cancer, the report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so it would still be NA. But since it's benign, definitely NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have TURP for sample type, no for malignancy, and NA for Gleason. Need to make sure the JSON is valid with proper quotes and structure. No nested elements, just a flat structure. Let me double-check the allowed values again to confirm. Yep, looks right.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
