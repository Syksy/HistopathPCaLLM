Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which I recall is typically associated with a TURP procedure. So the first field should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." That's a definite "no" for the second field.

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The user specified that Gleason is only for malignant cases. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be straightforward with each key-value pair. Let me double-check the allowed values for each field. Sample type allowed "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example here is TURP. Malignant findings are "yes", "no", or "NA" – here "no". Gleason is "NA" because it's benign. All looks good. No typos, and the JSON structure is valid. Alright, that's it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
