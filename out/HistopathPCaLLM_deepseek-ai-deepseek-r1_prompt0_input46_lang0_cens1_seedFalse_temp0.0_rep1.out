Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate material total size around 2x. Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run." There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says, "Regular prostate tissue with glands... Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." Since they couldn't determine if there's cancer, it's not confirmed as malignant. But the question is about findings. Since they can't assess, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't rule it out, maybe the answer is "no"? Wait, no. The key phrase is "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." So the presence of malignant tumor isn't determined. So the answer should be NA because it's inconclusive.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum, or NA if benign. Since the report doesn't mention any cancer, and the malignant finding is NA, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of Gleason scores here.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion reported. The answer should be straightforward.
