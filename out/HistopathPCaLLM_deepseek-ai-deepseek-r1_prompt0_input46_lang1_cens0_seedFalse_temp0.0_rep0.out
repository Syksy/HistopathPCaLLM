Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaali". "Höylättyjen" translates to shaved or planed, and "lastujen" means chips. TURP typically produces chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." That means no prostate cancer was found. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no cancer detected, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were benign findings like hyperplasia, Gleason isn't reported unless there's malignancy.

Double-checking each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. Malignancy is "ei". Gleason is NA. No nested structures, just straightforward answers. All set.

  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "ei",
