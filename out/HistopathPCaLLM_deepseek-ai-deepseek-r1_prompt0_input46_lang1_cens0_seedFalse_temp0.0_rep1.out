Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaali" which translates to shaved prostate chips. TURP typically involves removing tissue chips, so I think the sample type here is TURP. Biopsy would be needle cores, and RP is the whole prostate, so TURP fits.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista," meaning no prostate cancer was found. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" only for malignant cases, otherwise NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each key is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. The sample description definitely points to TURP. The absence of cancer is clear. Gleason is NA as expected. All fields accounted for, no errors spotted.

```json
{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
