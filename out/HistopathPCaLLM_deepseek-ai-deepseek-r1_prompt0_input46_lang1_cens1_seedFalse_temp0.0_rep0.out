Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Eturauhasmateriaalin yhteiskoko noin 2x. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille, pienempi osa materiaalista ajettiin." The mention of "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) and "ajettiin" (processed) suggests it's a biopsy sample, as biopsies are typically small and placed in cassettes. There's no mention of TURP or RP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei." This translates to "Could not determine whether there are changes related to cancer or not." Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain and not confirmed, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignant finding. However, the system might interpret "could not determine" as NA. Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says they couldn't determine if there are cancer-related changes. So technically, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, but it's also not ruled out. But according to the instructions, if there's no clear malignant findings, it's "ei". However, the uncertainty here might lead to "NA". Hmm, need to be careful. The key is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Ei voitu määrittää" which means it's inconclusive. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). Since they couldn't determine, the answer should be "ei" because there's no positive identification. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the test was inconclusive. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, so "ei" is appropriate. The presence of "Ei voitu määrittää" might mean that they couldn't find it, so the answer is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to report it as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy wasn't confirmed (answer to question 2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA
