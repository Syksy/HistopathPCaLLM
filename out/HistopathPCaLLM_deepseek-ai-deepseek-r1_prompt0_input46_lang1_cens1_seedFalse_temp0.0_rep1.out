Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Eturauhasmateriaalin yhteiskoko noin 2x. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille, pienempi osa materiaalista ajettiin." The mention of "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) and "ajettiin" (processed) suggests it's a biopsy sample, as biopsies are typically placed in cassettes. RP and TURP are surgical procedures, but there's no mention of surgery here. So sample type is likely "biopsy".

Next, the presence of malignancy. The text states: "Ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei." This translates to "It could not be determined whether there are changes related to cancer or not." Since the presence of malignancy couldn't be determined, the answer here should be "NA" as per the allowed values (kyllä, ei, NA). The report doesn't confirm or deny malignancy, just that it's uncertain.

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy wasn't confirmed, the Gleason grade should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with the uncertainty about malignancy.

Let me double-check each part. Sample type: no mention of surgery, so biopsy makes sense. Malignancy: inconclusive, so NA. Gleason: not applicable here. All seems to fit the criteria. No nested structures, just straightforward answers.
