Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Eturauhasmateriaalin yhteiskoko noin 2x. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille, pienempi osa materiaalista ajettiin." The mention of "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) and the size (2x) suggests it's a biopsy sample. RP and TURP are surgical procedures, but there's no mention of surgery here. So I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "Ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei." This translates to "Could not determine if there are changes related to cancer or not." Since it's uncertain, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. The answer here is "ei" (no) because they couldn't confirm malignancy. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the presence is undetermined, maybe "NA" is more appropriate? Hmm. The original instruction says for the second field: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If it's uncertain, perhaps the answer is "ei" because they didn't find definitive evidence. Alternatively, if the test was inconclusive, maybe "NA". The text says they couldn't determine if there were cancer-related changes. So maybe "ei" since no confirmed malignancy was found. But the options don't have an "undetermined" choice. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states that they couldn't determine, maybe "NA" is better here. But the user's instructions say "NA" for benign findings. Wait, the third field says "NA" for benign. So if the second field is "ei", that would mean benign. But in this case, the report is uncertain. However, the presence of malignancy is asked. If they couldn't determine, but there's no mention of malignancy, then perhaps "ei" is correct. Or maybe "NA" because the determination wasn't possible. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original Finnish again: "Ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei." So the presence of malignant changes couldn't be determined. Therefore, the answer isn't definitively "ei" (no), but rather unknown. However, the allowed options don't include "unknown", so perhaps "NA" is the correct choice here. But the user's instruction for the second field says "NA" is allowed. So maybe in this case, since it's uncertain, "NA" is appropriate. But I need to be careful. The question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report says they couldn't determine, then technically, the presence is not confirmed, so "ei" (no) might be the answer. But I think the correct approach here is to use "NA" when the information isn't available or can't be determined. So in this case, since the determination wasn't possible, "NA" would be the right choice.

Third, the Gleason grade. The text doesn't mention any Gleason score. Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain (or "ei" or "NA"), the Gleason grade would be "NA" as per the instructions. If there are no malignant findings, Gleason is "NA". So regardless of the second field's answer, if there's no malignancy, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: NA (since couldn't determine) or "ei" if we consider that no confirmed malignancy was found. But given the options, maybe "ei" is better here. Wait, the report says "Ei voitu määrittää..." which is "Could not determine...", so it's unclear. The user's instruction says for the second field: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is benign, then "ei". If it's uncertain, maybe "NA". But the options don't have an "undetermined" value. The user's examples might clarify. Let me think again. The third field's Gleason is "NA" if benign. So if the second field is "ei", then third is "NA". If the second field is "NA", then third is "NA" as well. But in this case, since the presence of malignancy is uncertain, but no definite findings, perhaps "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei". The text mentions "Ei voitu määrittää..." which is more about whether the changes are related to cancer. The actual presence of malignant cells isn't confirmed. So the answer for malignant findings would be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the second field is "ei", and third is "NA".

Wait, but the user's instruction says: "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). But in this case, there's no mention of any lesions with cancer. The findings are normal prostate tissue with some hyperplasia, but no cancer. So the presence of malignancy is "ei", Gleason "NA".

So final answers:

1. biopsy
2. ei
3. NA
