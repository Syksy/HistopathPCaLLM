Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The input mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left." The term "biopsies" clearly indicates the sample type is biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. So here, it's definitely "biopsy".

Next, malignant findings. The report states "No malign findings on the left or the right." "No malign findings" translates to "no" for the second field. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since there's an explicit statement of no malignancy, the answer is "no".

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there were grades mentioned, since the tumor is benign, we still put NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward. Also, the user specified to take the most severe lesion, but in this case, there are no malignant findings, so all answers are based on that. 

Double-checking the original text: no mention of RP or TURP, just biopsies. No malignancy, so Gleason isn't applicable. Everything seems to fit. The JSON should be valid, so proper quotes and structure. Alright, that's all.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
