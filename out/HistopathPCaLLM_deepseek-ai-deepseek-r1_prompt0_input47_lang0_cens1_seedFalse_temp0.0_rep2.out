Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70." The mention of prostatic material quantity might suggest TURP, as TURP often yields chips that are measured in grams. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not quantified like this. RP would be the entire prostate, but the numbers here add up to 70, which could be grams, typical for TURP. So sample type is likely TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." So the report is uncertain. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since they couldn't confirm malignancy, but also didn't confirm its absence, maybe the answer is "no"? Wait, but the options are yes, no, or NA. If the report is inconclusive, perhaps NA is appropriate here. Because the statement says they can't determine, so it's not a definitive yes or no. So malignant findings would be NA.

Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason score. Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason is only reported for malignant cases, this should be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Let me check the allowed values again. Yes, sample type TURP is allowed. Malignant is NA. Gleason is NA. So the JSON should have those three keys with the respective values.

  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
