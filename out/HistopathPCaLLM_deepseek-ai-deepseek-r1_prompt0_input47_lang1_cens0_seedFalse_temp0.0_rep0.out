Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kolme biopsiapalaa" which translates to three biopsy pieces. So the sample type is biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Definitely biopsy here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella." That means no malignant findings on either side. So the answer here is "ei".

For the Gleason score, since there are no malignancies, the value should be NA. The Gleason is only reported if there's a malignancy. The user specified that if benign, use NA. So no need to look for any numbers here.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct. No nested structures, just flat keys. Let me double-check the allowed values again. Sample type is correct as "biopsy". Malignancy is "ei". Gleason is "NA". All fields accounted for. No typos in the keys. Should be good to go.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
