Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "kolme biopsiapalaa" which translates to three biopsy pieces. So the original sample type is a biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So here, it's definitely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella." That means no malignant findings on either side. So the answer here should be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The Gleason is only reported if there are malignant results. 

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and using the specified syntax. Let me double-check each field. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. All values fit the allowed options. No typos. The JSON should look like this with the three keys and appropriate values.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
```
