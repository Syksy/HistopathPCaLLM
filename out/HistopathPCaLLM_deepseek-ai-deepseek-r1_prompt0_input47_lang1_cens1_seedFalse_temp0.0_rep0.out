Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Eturauhasmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on noin 30+40=70." The term "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which is a procedure where tissue is removed, often in chunks. The numbers 30+40=70 might refer to grams, which is typical for TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The text says "Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla." That translates to "It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right." Since they can't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that they can't determine if there are malignant findings. So does that mean it's uncertain, but the presence is not confirmed. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If it's undetermined, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Or is "NA" more appropriate here? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report says they can't determine, then maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no positive identification. Alternatively, if the presence is uncertain, maybe "NA". But according to the allowed values, "NA" is for benign findings. Wait, the third field says Gleason is "NA" for benign. So if the presence of malignancy is "ei", then Gleason would be NA. But in this case, the report says they can't determine. Hmm. The question is phrased as "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the answer is that it couldn't be determined, then perhaps the answer is "NA". But the allowed values for the second field are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The user's instructions say that if the sample is benign, then Gleason is NA. But here, the malignancy is undetermined. So maybe the presence is "ei" because it's not confirmed, but the report is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe "NA" is the correct answer here. The original text says "Ei voida määrittää", which is "cannot be determined". So perhaps the answer is "NA" for the second field. But I need to check the allowed values again. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". If the presence is undetermined, then "NA" would be appropriate here. So I think the second field should be "NA".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant cases, else "NA". Since the presence of malignancy couldn't be determined, and the second field is "NA", then the Gleason would also be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports this.

So putting it all together:

1. Sample type: TURP (because of the TURP-like specimen description with total weight)
2. Malignant findings: NA (since it's undetermined)
3. Gleason: NA (as no malignancy confirmed)
