Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Eturauhasmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on noin 30+40=70." The total material is 70, which sounds like it's from a TURP procedure because TURP typically yields more tissue compared to a biopsy. Biopsies are usually smaller samples. RP would be the entire prostate, but the numbers here don't suggest that. So I'll go with TURP for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states, "Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla." So they couldn't determine if there are malignant findings. The presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so according to the instructions, if it's uncertain, maybe we should put NA here. But wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" (Were there malignant findings in the sample?). Since the report says they can't determine, the answer isn't yes or no, so NA is appropriate.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy wasn't confirmed (it's NA in the second field), the Gleason should also be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports using NA here.

Double-checking each part. Sample type: TURP because of the tissue amount. Malignancy: NA because indeterminate. Gleason: NA as no malignancy found. All seems to fit the criteria. No nested structures, just the three fields with the specified values.
