Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format, using the allowed values provided.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the given statement, it starts with "Examining prostate resection..." The term "resection" here is key. A prostate resection typically refers to a surgical procedure where part or all of the prostate is removed. "RP" usually refers to radical prostatectomy, which is the removal of the entire prostate. However, TURP is a different procedure where only part of the prostate is removed, often to relieve symptoms. The mention of "prostate resection" might lean towards TURP, but I need to be careful. However, the summary mentions "resection" again, and since TURP is a type of resection, but RP is also a resection. Wait, but the sample includes seminal vesicles, which are usually removed during a radical prostatectomy. The presence of seminal vesicles in the cassettes (I & J) suggests that the entire prostate and surrounding structures were removed, which is more indicative of a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here is likely RP.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Additionally, terms like "capsule invasion" and "perineural growth" are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." However, the detailed description mentions two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 as the most common and 3 as the next, which would be 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small portion of 4, so 5+4=9. Since the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, the second focus with Gleason 9 is the highest. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be 5+4=9. But wait, the summary says Gleason 9, which aligns with the second focus. The highest grade is the one to report, so 5+4=9.

Putting it all together: sample type is RP, malignant findings are yes, and Gleason is 5+4=9. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted.
