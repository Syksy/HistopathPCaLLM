Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "prostate resection," which typically refers to a surgical removal. Since RP is a type of resection, but TURP is also a resection procedure. Wait, the sample mentions "resection" and the weight is 100g. Radical prostatectomies usually remove the entire prostate, which in adults is normally around 20-30 grams. A 100g prostate is more indicative of a TURP, which is done for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) where the prostate is enlarged. So TURP might be the correct answer here. But I need to confirm. The term "resection" can be used for both, but given the weight, TURP is more likely. So original sample type is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement clearly mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The user wants the format "major+minor=sum". The highest Gleason mentioned is in the second focus: Gleason 5 (>80%) with some 4. But the summary says Gleason 9. Wait, Gleason scores are the sum of the two most common grades. If the primary is 5 and secondary is 4, that's 5+4=9. The first focus was 4+3=7, but the user wants the most severe lesion. The second focus is Gleason 5+4=9, which is higher. So the answer should be "5+4=9".

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 5+4=9. Need to make sure the JSON is valid with no nested structures. Also check allowed values. The answer should be in JSON format with the three keys.
