Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." Autopsy samples aren't listed in the allowed values, so the answer here should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "Some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns" but also states it's for educational purposes and not used to derive differentiation scores like Gleason. There's no mention of malignancy, so I think the answer here is NA. It's not explicitly stated as yes or no, so NA is appropriate.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example format is major+minor=sum. The summary section mentions Gleason 1-5 but says it's not used to derive scores. Since they aren't providing a specific Gleason score, the answer should be NA. Even though Gleason is mentioned, it's not assigned a value here.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid with no nested structures and only the most severe lesion's results. Since there's no severity indicated, just use the provided info.
