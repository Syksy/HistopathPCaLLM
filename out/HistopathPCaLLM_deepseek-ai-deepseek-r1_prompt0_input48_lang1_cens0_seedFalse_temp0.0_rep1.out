Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and the reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report starts with "prostataresekaatti," which translates to prostate resection. In medical terms, a resection could refer to a radical prostatectomy, so I think RP is the correct type here. TURP is a different procedure, usually for removing part of the prostate, but the term "resekaatti" might be more aligned with RP. So I'll go with RP for the first field.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinooma," which is adenocarcinoma, a type of malignant tumor. There's also mention of capsular invasion and perineural growth, both indicative of malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states in the summary: "YHTEENVETO: Resekaatissa löydetään siis Gleason 9 kasvain." That translates to a Gleason score of 9. However, the detailed description mentions two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 (most common) and 3 (next), which would sum to 7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (over 80%) and some 4, which would be 5+4=9. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. Since Gleason 9 is the highest mentioned in the summary and the second focus, the correct format is "5+4=9". 

Wait, but the user specifies "major+minor=sum" as the format. The first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5+4=9. The worst is 5+4=9, so that's the one to report. The summary also states Gleason 9, which aligns with this. So the third field should be "5+4=9".
