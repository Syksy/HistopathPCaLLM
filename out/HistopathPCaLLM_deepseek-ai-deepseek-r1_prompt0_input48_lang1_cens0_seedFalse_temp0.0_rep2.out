Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "prostataresekaatti" which translates to prostate resection specimen. "Resekaatissa" in the summary also suggests a resection. Now, RP is a type of resection, but TURP is another. However, the weight given is 100g. A typical prostate is around 20-30g, so a 100g specimen is more likely from a radical prostatectomy (RP) rather than a TURP, which usually removes smaller amounts. So I'll go with RP.

Next, whether there's malignancy. The text clearly states "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The report mentions two foci. In the first focus, the most common (major) is Gleason 4, next (minor) is 3, summing to 7. The second focus has Gleason 5 as major (>80%) and minor 4, sum 9. The summary states Gleason 9, which is the highest. So the worst is 5+4=9. The answer should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Check the allowed values again: sample type is correct as RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 5+4=9. All set.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "5+4=9"
}
