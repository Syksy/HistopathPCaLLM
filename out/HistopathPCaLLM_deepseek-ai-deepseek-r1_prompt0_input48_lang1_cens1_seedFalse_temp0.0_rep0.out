Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "useasta ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" which translates to material obtained from multiple autopsies. Autopsy isn't one of the allowed values, so I have to check if there's another clue. The samples are processed with apex, central part, base, and seminal vesicles on cassettes. That sounds more like a surgical specimen, maybe from a prostatectomy. But since it's from an autopsy, which isn't listed, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Autopsy isn't any of those, so NA would be correct here.

Second, whether there were malignant findings. The text mentions "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" (some exemplary histological changes) in two areas. But the summary says "Joitakin kiinnostavia löydöksiä havaittu, mutta... Gleason 1-5" but they aren't used to determine differentiation grades. The key here is that they mention Gleason scores in an example context, but the actual findings are not used to assign a grade. The question is whether there were malignant findings. The report doesn't state cancer explicitly. The changes are described as "kiinnostavia" (interesting) but not clearly malignant. Since Gleason is mentioned but in a demonstrative context, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because they aren't confirming malignancy. Alternatively, if the presence of any Gleason reference implies malignancy, but the summary says they aren't using them to determine grades. Hmm. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If there's no confirmed malignancy, then "ei". So I think the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The summary says "esim. Gleason 1-5" as an example, but they aren't using it to determine the differentiation grades. Since the findings aren't used to assign a Gleason score, and the report doesn't provide a specific major+minor=sum, the answer should be "NA" because there are no malignant findings. Even if there were, the example isn't a real score. So "NA" is correct.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA (autopsy not listed), malignant findings "ei", Gleason "NA".
