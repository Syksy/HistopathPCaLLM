Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "useasta ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" which translates to "material obtained from multiple autopsies". None of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP) match an autopsy sample. So the answer here should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" (some exemplary histological changes) and mentions that they can't determine differentiation changes, but there are interesting trends. However, the summary states that these findings aren't used to determine differentiation grades like Gleason. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy (like carcinoma or cancer), and the changes are described as examples for teaching, it's possible that these are not malignant. So the answer here might be "ei" (no). But I need to be careful. The absence of clear malignant terms (like pahanlaatuinen, kasvain, syöpä) suggests "ei".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example mentions "esim. Gleason 1-5" but clarifies that these aren't used to determine the grades. Since there's no actual Gleason score reported for a malignant case, and the malignancy answer is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
