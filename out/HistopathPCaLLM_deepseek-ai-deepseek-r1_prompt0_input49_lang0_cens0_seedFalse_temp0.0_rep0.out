Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses." The term "shavings" and "chippings" often relate to TURP specimens, as TURP involves removing tissue from the prostate, which is then processed into chips or shavings. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma." Carcinoma indicates malignancy, so the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report mentions, "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is typically the sum of the primary (most common) and secondary (second most common) grades. So 3 + 4 = 7. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum," which would be "3+4=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there are multiple shavings with carcinoma, but the highest Gleason mentioned is 3+4=7, that's the one to report. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so each field is a top-level key.

Double-checking the allowed values and making sure there are no typos. Sample type TURP, malignant yes, Gleason 3+4=7. All values fit the allowed options. No need for NA here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
