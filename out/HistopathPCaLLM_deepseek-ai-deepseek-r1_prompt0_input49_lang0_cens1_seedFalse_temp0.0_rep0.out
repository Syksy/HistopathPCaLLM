Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The provided statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses". The term "glasses" here likely refers to slides, which are commonly used in biopsies. So, the sample type is probably a biopsy. However, the statement doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. But since biopsies are typically associated with multiple slides (glasses), I'll go with "biopsy" here. If there's uncertainty, maybe "NA" would be safer, but the context points to biopsy.

Next, the presence of malignant tumor. The statement says the fifth glass had changes needing further investigation, but assessment isn't possible due to technical limitations. So, there's a suspicion but no confirmation. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since it's not confirmed, and the question is about whether there were malignant findings, the answer here should be "NA" because it's uncertain. They can't assess due to technical issues, so we can't say yes or no definitively.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the assessment couldn't be completed, there's no Gleason grade reported. So, this should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are NA, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Check if the values are correctly assigned. The most severe lesion is considered, but since the findings are inconclusive, the highest severity isn't determined. So, the answers should reflect the available data without assuming malignancy.
