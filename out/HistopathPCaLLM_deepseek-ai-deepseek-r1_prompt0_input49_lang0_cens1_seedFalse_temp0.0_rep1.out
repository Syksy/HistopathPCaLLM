Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses." The term "glasses" here likely refers to slides, which are commonly used in biopsies. However, TURP specimens can also be processed in multiple slides. But the mention of "rest of the prostate samples" might suggest a TURP, where multiple chips are examined. Alternatively, a biopsy usually involves multiple cores, each in a separate container. The term "glasses" isn't standard, but if it's a TURP, the sample type would be TURP. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. Since it's not clear, maybe the answer is NA here. Wait, but the user expects one of the allowed values. Let me think again. The mention of "8 glasses" could be biopsy cores, but without explicit terms like "biopsy" or "TURP", it's safer to put NA. But sometimes in pathology reports, the sample type is inferred. If the report is about prostate samples, and they mention glasses (slides), but the original procedure isn't stated, maybe NA is correct. So sample type: NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The statement says the fifth glass has changes needing further investigation, but assessment isn't possible due to technical limitations. So there's a suspicion but no confirmation. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's not confirmed, the answer here would be NA. They can't determine malignancy yet, so it's not yes or no. So malignant findings: NA.

Gleason grade. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, and the Gleason is only reported for malignant cases, this should be NA. Even if there were a suspicion, without a confirmed diagnosis, Gleason isn't assigned. So Gleason: NA.

Putting it all together in JSON without nested structures. Check if all values are correctly assigned. Sample type NA, malignant NA, Gleason NA. That seems right based on the provided text.
