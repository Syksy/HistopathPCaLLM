Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" which translates to "prostate resection chips." TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP." The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma" meaning carcinoma was found in 5 chips. Since carcinoma is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. So that's the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The report states the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next most common is 4. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. So major is 4 (since it's the higher grade), minor is 3, sum is 7. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. But in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) pattern is the most predominant, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the highest grade present, not necessarily the most frequent. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, does that affect it? Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (second most extensive) grade. So if the most common is 3 and the next is 4, then the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the user instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. Wait, the question says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which means the worst lesion's results. So if in some areas there's 4 and others 3, but the worst is 4+3, but in this case, the most common is 3, next is 4. Wait, but the standard Gleason scoring is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive), and if there's a tertiary pattern (third most), it's not included unless it's higher than the primary or secondary. But in this case, the text says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4, so sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7". But wait, the user instructions specify that for Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher grade? Or the most common? Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. So even if the secondary is a higher grade, the primary is the most common. For example, if the most common is 3 and the next is 4, it's 3+4=7. If the most common is 4 and next is 3, it's 4+3=7. But the sum is the same, but the grouping is different. So in this case, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7". 

But wait, the user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which might mean the highest Gleason score found. If there are multiple lesions, but the worst one is 4+3=7, but in this case, the most common is 3 and next is 4. So the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the sum is 7. So the answer is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. 

I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and the allowed values are followed. So the JSON should be:

{
  "1": "TURP",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "3+4=7"
}

But wait, the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers. So the major is the primary (most common) and minor is the secondary. Wait, no, actually, in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. The sum is primary + secondary. So if the most common is 3 and next is 4, it's 3+4=7. So the answer is correct as 3+4=7. 

Yes, that's right. So the final JSON should have those three fields with those values.
