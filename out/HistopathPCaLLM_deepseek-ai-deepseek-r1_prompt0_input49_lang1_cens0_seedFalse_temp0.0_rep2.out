Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" which translates to "prostate resection chips." TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP." The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma" meaning carcinoma was found in 5 chips. Since carcinoma is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. So that's the second field.

Third, the Gleason grade. The report states the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next most common is 4. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. So major is 4 (since it's the higher grade), minor is 3, sum is 7. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. But in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) pattern is the most predominant, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the highest grade present, not necessarily the most frequent. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, does that affect it? Wait, no, according to the current Gleason grading system, the primary grade is the most predominant pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if a higher grade is present but not the most common, it's still the secondary. Wait, but in this case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So primary would be 3, secondary 4, sum 3+4=7. But the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion" which translates to "worst lesion." So maybe they want the highest Gleason found, not the most common? Wait, the original instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" meaning only the worst lesion's results should be reported. So if there are multiple lesions, take the worst one. But in the text, it says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So the most common (primary) is 3, next (secondary) is 4. But if the worst lesion is the one with the highest grade, then maybe the primary is 4 and secondary 3? Wait, no. The Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns. However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, but it's part of the same tumor, then the primary is the most common. Wait, but according to current guidelines, the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. So in this case, primary 3, secondary 4, sum 3+4=7. However, the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion" which might mean the highest Gleason score present, regardless of being primary or secondary. But the text here is stating the most common and next most common, which aligns with the standard primary and secondary. So the answer should be 3+4=7. But wait, the user's example in the problem statement shows "major+minor=sum" where major is the higher grade. Wait, no, in standard Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next. But if the secondary is a higher grade than the primary, does that affect the sum? For example, if primary is 3 and secondary is 4, the sum is 3+4=7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, sum is 4+3=7. But the way it's reported is primary + secondary, regardless of which is higher. However, in practice, if the secondary is higher than the primary, sometimes it's still reported as primary + secondary. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, secondary is the next. So in this case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So primary 3, secondary 4, sum 7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7". But the user's instruction says "major+minor=sum" where major is the higher grade? Or is major the primary (most common) and minor the secondary? This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the standard Gleason scoring. The Gleason score is the sum of the primary (most prevalent) pattern and the secondary (second most prevalent) pattern. So even if the secondary is a higher grade, it's still added. For example, if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, the score is 3+4=7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, it's 4+3=7. But in both cases, the sum is 7. However, in some cases, if there's a tertiary pattern (third most common) of a higher grade, that might be noted, but the user's instruction says to take the worst lesion. But in the given text, it's only mentioning the two most common: 3 and 4. So the answer should be 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason luokka is "3+4=7". 

Putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. The JSON should reflect that without nested structures, just the three fields.
