Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The term "prostatanäytteistä" translates to prostate samples. However, the text doesn't specify the type of sample like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia" and "löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia." So there are some changes needing further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. Since it's uncertain whether these changes are malignant, the presence of malignancy can't be confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's inconclusive, the answer here is "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Additionally, since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions (only report for malignant cases).

So the structured JSON should have all three fields as "NA".

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "NA",
  "3": "NA"
