Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The term "prostatanäytteistä" translates to prostate samples. However, the text doesn't specify the type of sample like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't mentioned here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text mentions "viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia" and "löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia." So there are some changes needing further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed as malignant, the presence of malignancy can't be confirmed as "kyllä" (yes). It's also not clearly "ei" (no) because there are changes. So the safest answer here is "NA" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

So the structured JSON would have all three fields as "NA".

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
