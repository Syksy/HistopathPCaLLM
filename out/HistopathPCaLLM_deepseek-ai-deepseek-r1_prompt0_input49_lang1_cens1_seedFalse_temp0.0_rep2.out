Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The term "prostatanäytteistä" translates to prostate samples. However, there's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia. Juuri nyt löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia." So there are some changes that need further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report states that assessment isn't possible, the presence of malignancy can't be determined. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's uncertain, the answer here is "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed (previous answer is "NA"), the Gleason grade should also be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scores in the text either, which supports using "NA".

So putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON structure is correct without nested structures and uses the allowed values.
