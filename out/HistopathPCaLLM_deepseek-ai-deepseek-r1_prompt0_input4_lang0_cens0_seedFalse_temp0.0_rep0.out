Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to answer three specific questions in JSON format based on the provided text.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the statement, it starts with "Samples 1 to 6 consist of prostate biopsies..." So the sample type here is clearly "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report mentions that the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed. It also states there's no adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor and the report explicitly says they don't find it, the answer here should be "no".

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report indicates no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. So the value here is "NA".

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but in this case, all findings are benign, so there's no severity to consider. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so just a flat object with the three keys. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any malignant terms or Gleason scores. The key phrases are "benign prostate tissue" and "no adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes". That solidifies the answers. Alright, time to structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
