Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "several sampling sites from standard locations" and mentions that one sample part isn't representative as it lacks prostate tissue. The term "sampling sites" and the context of checking for prostate tissue suggests this is a biopsy. Biopsy samples are taken from various sites to check for cancer. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that there are no notable atypical patterns, but the sample is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since the sample is insufficient, they can't confirm the presence of malignancy. However, the absence of atypia might suggest no malignancy, but the key here is that the assessment is inconclusive due to insufficient material. The allowed values don't have an "inconclusive" option, so I need to see if it's yes, no, or NA. Since they can't reliably assess, maybe NA is appropriate here. But wait, the instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if there's no evidence found, but the sample is insufficient, does that mean "no" or "NA"? The report says "no notable atypic patterns" but can't assess for adenocarcinoma. So maybe the answer is "no" because no malignancy was found, but the sample was insufficient to fully rule it out. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The user might consider that since the sample is insufficient, the presence can't be determined, hence NA. But the allowed values for malignant findings are yes, no, or NA. If the report says no malignancy found but the sample is insufficient, perhaps the answer is "no" because the available tissue didn't show malignancy, even though it's possible it's not representative. Alternatively, if the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is NA. The instructions say "NA" if the information isn't available. Since the sample is insufficient to assess, maybe the answer is NA. But the report says "no notable atypic patterns are present," which might imply no malignancy. However, the pathologist can't confirm due to insufficient material. So in this case, the correct answer might be "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy in the observed tissue, even though the sample is limited. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the report states any malignant findings. Since it says "no notable atypic," that suggests no malignancy found, but the sample is insufficient. So the answer for malignant findings would be "no" because they didn't find any, even though the sample isn't perfect. Alternatively, if the sample is insufficient, maybe the presence can't be determined, hence NA. The user's instruction says "NA" for the Gleason grade if benign. But for the malignant tumor findings, if the sample is insufficient but no malignancy is found, maybe it's "no". I think the answer here is "no" because the report states no notable atypia, so no malignancy detected, even though the sample is insufficient. So field 2 is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as numbers or NA for benign. Since the malignant finding is "no" (if that's the case), then Gleason grade should be NA. If the malignant finding were "yes", then we'd need the Gleason score. Since the answer to field 2 is "no", Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Let me double-check. The sample mentions "sampling sites" which aligns with biopsy. The report says no atypia but insufficient to assess. So no malignancy found, hence "no". Gleason is NA because it's benign. That seems right.
