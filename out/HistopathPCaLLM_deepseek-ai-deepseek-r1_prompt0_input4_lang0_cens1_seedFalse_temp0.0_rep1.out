Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "several sampling sites from standard locations" and mentions that one sample part isn't representative as it lacks prostate tissue. The term "sampling sites" and the context of checking for prostate tissue suggests this is a biopsy. Biopsy samples are taken from various sites to check for cancer. So I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that there are no notable atypical patterns, but the sample is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since the sample is insufficient, they can't confirm the presence of malignancy. However, the absence of atypia might suggest no malignancy, but the key here is that the assessment is inconclusive due to insufficient material. The allowed values don't have an "inconclusive" option, so I need to see if it's yes, no, or NA. Since they can't reliably assess, maybe NA is appropriate here. But wait, the instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if there's no mention of malignancy, and the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is "no" because they didn't find any, but the sample is insufficient. Wait, the statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present" which suggests no signs of malignancy, but the sample is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma. So maybe the answer is "no" because they didn't find any malignancy, even though the sample is limited. But the user instruction says to return NA if it's not applicable. Hmm. Alternatively, since the sample is insufficient, maybe the presence can't be determined, hence NA. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report says "no notable atypic" but can't assess reliably. So perhaps the answer is "no" because they didn't find any, but the sample is insufficient. Or maybe NA because the assessment is unreliable. The user instruction says "NA" for benign statements. Wait, the third field's Gleason grade is "NA" for benign. But the second field is about malignant findings. If the sample is insufficient, but they didn't find any malignancy, maybe it's "no". But I need to be careful. The key is whether malignant findings were present. The report says no notable atypia, but insufficient to assess. So maybe the answer is "no" because no malignancy was found, even though the sample is limited. Alternatively, if the sample is insufficient, maybe the presence can't be determined, hence NA. The user might prefer "no" here because the absence of atypia suggests no malignancy, but the sample's insufficiency is a separate issue. I think the answer here is "no" for malignant findings.

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason score because there's no malignancy detected. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

So putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason grade is NA. Let me double-check. The sample type: the terms "sampling sites" and "sampled tissue" from standard locations, which aligns with biopsy. Malignant findings: the report states no notable atypia, but insufficient sample. However, since no malignancy was found, even if the sample is limited, the answer is "no". Gleason grade isn't applicable here, so NA. That seems right.
