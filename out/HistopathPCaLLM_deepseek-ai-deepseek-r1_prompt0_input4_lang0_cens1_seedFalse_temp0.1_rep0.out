Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, it mentions "several sampling sites" and "sample part" which might indicate a biopsy since they're taking samples from different locations. But the text also says one sample isn't representative and there's insufficient material. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The terms like "sampling sites" and "sample part" are a bit vague. Since it's not clear if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe the answer here is NA because the type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "no notable atypic patterns" and "insufficient to reliably assess... presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." Since they can't reliably assess due to insufficient material, but there's no mention of malignancy found, the answer here should be "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy. Wait, but the user says to take the most severe lesion. However, the report states that the sample isn't representative and the material is insufficient. So maybe it's not possible to determine malignancy. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the assessment is inconclusive due to insufficient material, maybe the answer is "no" because they didn't find any malignancy, but the sample was inadequate. Alternatively, maybe NA. Hmm. The key is "no notable atypic" and "insufficient to assess." Since they can't assess reliably, maybe the answer is "no" because there's no positive finding, but the sample is inadequate. Or is it NA because the assessment couldn't be done? The allowed values don't have an inconclusive option. The options are yes, no, or NA. Since the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is "no" because no malignancy was found in the observed tissue, even though they couldn't fully assess. Or perhaps NA because the assessment wasn't possible. The user instructions say to return NA if it's not applicable. Since the sample is insufficient to assess, maybe the answer is NA. But the statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present," which suggests no malignancy found in the observed parts. So maybe "no" is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no" (if we go with that), then Gleason grade would be NA. But if the malignant finding is NA, then Gleason is also NA. Either way, since there's no malignancy reported, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA because it's not specified. Malignant is "no" because no atypia found, even though sample was insufficient. Gleason is NA. But wait, the user says to take the most severe lesion. The statement mentions "no notable atypic" and insufficient sample. So the most severe lesion here is none found. So malignant is "no", Gleason NA. Sample type: the original sample type isn't specified, so NA.
