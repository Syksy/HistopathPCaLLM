Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "several sampling sites from standard locations" and mentions "sample part" not having prostate tissue. The terms "sampling sites" and "sample part" suggest this is a biopsy, as biopsies involve taking multiple samples. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that there's no notable atypic patterns, but the sample is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since the sample is inadequate, they can't confirm malignancy. However, the absence of noted malignancy doesn't necessarily mean it's benign. The answer here should be "no" because there's no positive finding of malignancy, but the report also mentions uncertainty due to insufficient material. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the sample is insufficient, maybe NA is more appropriate. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they couldn't assess reliably, but didn't find any, maybe "no" is correct. Alternatively, if the assessment is inconclusive, perhaps NA. Hmm. The key is "were there findings" – if the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is NA. But the statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present", which suggests no malignancy found. So maybe "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of any tumor, so yes, that's correct.
