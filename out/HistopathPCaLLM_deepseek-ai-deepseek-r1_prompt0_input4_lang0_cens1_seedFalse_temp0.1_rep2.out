Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "several sampling sites from standard locations" and mentions that one sample part isn't representative as it lacks prostate tissue. The terms "sampling sites" and "sample part" suggest this is a biopsy, where multiple samples are taken. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I'll go with biopsy.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that there are no notable atypical patterns and that the sample is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since they couldn't find malignancy but also couldn't reliably exclude it due to insufficient material, the answer here should be "no" because there's no positive identification of malignancy. However, the note about insufficient sample might complicate things. But the question is about findings, not adequacy. Since no malignancy was found, even if the sample was insufficient, the answer is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason scoring here because there's no malignancy detected.

So putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignant findings are no, Gleason grade is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check the original text for any clues I might have missed. The key points are no atypia, insufficient sample to assess, but no malignancy found. Yep, that's correct.
