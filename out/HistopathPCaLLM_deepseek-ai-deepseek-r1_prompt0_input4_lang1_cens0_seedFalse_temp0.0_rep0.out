Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista," which translates to prostate biopsies from specific sites. The samples are numbered 1-6, and they refer to biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The text states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia," meaning no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. Also, it mentions "benigniä prostatakudosta" (benign prostate tissue) and no significant atypia. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. If there were cancer, we'd need to look for major and minor patterns and sum them, but here it's not applicable.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward: "Alkuperä", "Pahanlaatuisuus", "Gleason". The allowed values are correctly applied. No typos in the Finnish terms. Also, confirming that only the worst lesion is considered, but since there's no cancer, all fields are covered appropriately.

{
  "Alkuperä": "biopsy",
  "Pahanlaatuisuus": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
