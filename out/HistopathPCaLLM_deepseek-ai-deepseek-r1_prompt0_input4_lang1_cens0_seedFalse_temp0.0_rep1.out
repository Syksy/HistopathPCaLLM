Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line says "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." "Biopsiat" is plural for biopsies, so the sample type is biopsy. The answer here should be "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy Presence**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes found. That means malignant findings are absent. The answer is "ei."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no carcinoma, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So the answer here is "NA."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each answer is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Benigniä prostatakudosta" means benign prostate tissue, reinforcing no malignancy. The sample type is clearly biopsy. All criteria seem met. No mention of RP or TURP, so biopsy is correct. Gleason isn't needed here because there's no cancer. Everything checks out.
