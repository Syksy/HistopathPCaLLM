Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The word "biopsiat" is plural for biopsies, so the sample type should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes, which are considered malignant. Therefore, the answer here is "ei."

For the Gleason grade, since there are no malignant findings, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were some benign changes, Gleason is only for malignant cases.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. Since all samples are benign except sample 3, which is non-representative, but the main conclusion is no malignancy. So the answers are clear.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
