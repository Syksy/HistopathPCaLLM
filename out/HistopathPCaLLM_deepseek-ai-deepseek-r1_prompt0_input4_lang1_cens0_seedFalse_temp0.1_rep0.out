Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista," which translates to prostate biopsies from specific sites. So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia," meaning no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. All samples are described as benign ("benigniä prostatakudosta") and no significant atypia. So the answer here should be "ei."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So the third field is "NA."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is a top-level key. Also, the instructions mention to only include the worst lesion's results, but since there are no malignancies, that's not an issue here. 

Double-checking the Finnish terms to confirm: "ei löydetä karsinoomaa" clearly means no cancer found. The sample type is biopsy, so all three fields are correctly filled as "biopsy," "ei," and "NA." No mistakes here.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
