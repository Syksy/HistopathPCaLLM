Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to fill three fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line says "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The word "biopsiat" is plural for biopsies. So the sample type here is biopsy. The other samples mentioned (3 and others) are all biopsies, so the answer should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy Presence**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes found. PIN is a pre-malignant condition, but since it's not present either, the answer here is "ei".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy, this should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason score. The report doesn't mention cancer, so Gleason isn't applicable. Also, checking if all samples are accounted for. The problematic sample 3 isn't representative but others are benign. No signs of cancer anywhere. So the structured data should be straightforward.
