Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format. Let me start by understanding each requirement carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The term "prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That should be straightforward.

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states, "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." Translating that: no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. PIN is prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which can be a precursor but isn't malignant itself. Since there's no mention of cancer (karsinooma), the answer here should be "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report says no carcinoma was found, there's no Gleason score to report. So this field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is a top-level key. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there are no malignant lesions. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Benigniä prostatakudosta" means benign prostate tissue. "Ei merkittävää atypiaa" means no significant atypia. All confirmatory of benign findings. So the structured data should correctly reflect biopsy as the sample type, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason.
