Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the phrases "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" (several sampling sites) and "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" (tissue processed as samples) suggest that this is a biopsy. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the sample type is likely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions no atypical structures. Since there's no evidence of malignancy found, but the sample is inadequate, the answer here might be "ei" (no) because no malignancy was detected. However, the note about insufficient material could complicate things. But the question is whether malignant findings were present, and since they couldn't confirm it, the safest answer is "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma, and malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Wait, but the user said to only include the worst lesion's results. Since there's no malignancy detected, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text. The key part is "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman... läsnäoloa." So they can't reliably assess, but no positive findings are reported. So malignancy is "ei", Gleason NA, sample type biopsy.
