Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the phrases "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" (several sampling sites) and "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" (tissue processed as samples) suggest that this is a biopsy. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the sample type is likely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions no atypical structures. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but the sample might be inadequate, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no). However, I need to be careful here. The report says the sample isn't enough to evaluate, so maybe it's uncertain. But the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since they couldn't assess it reliably and didn't find any, the answer is "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Wait, but the user mentioned to consider only the worst lesion's results. However, in this case, there's no malignancy detected, so Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text. The key part is "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So the sample is insufficient to assess, but no malignancy was found. Therefore, the answer for malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA.

Sample type is biopsy. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA.
