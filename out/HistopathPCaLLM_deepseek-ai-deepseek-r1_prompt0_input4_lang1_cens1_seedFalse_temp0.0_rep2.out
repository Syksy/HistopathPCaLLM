Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the phrases "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" (several sampling sites) and "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" (tissue processed as samples) suggest that this is a biopsy, as multiple sampling sites are typical for biopsies. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so the sample type is likely "biopsy".

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text states that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. However, it also mentions no atypical structures were found. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, but the sample is inadequate for a reliable assessment, the safest answer here is "ei" (no), because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. But wait, the absence of evidence isn't necessarily evidence of absence. The report says the material isn't enough to evaluate, so maybe "NA"? But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't find any malignancy, even though the sample is insufficient, the answer might be "ei". However, the uncertainty here is tricky. The key phrase is "mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole havaittu" (no atypical structures observed), which leans towards "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because they couldn't assess due to insufficient material. So Gleason is definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason remains NA. Double-checking the original text for any missed details. The sample isn't representative in one area, but overall, no malignancy found. So the structured data should reflect that.
