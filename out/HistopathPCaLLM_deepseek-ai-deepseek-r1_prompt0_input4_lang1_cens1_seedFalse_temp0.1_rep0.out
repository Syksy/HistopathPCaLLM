Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the report mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" which translates to "several sampling sites" and refers to standard locations. The term "näytteenottokohtia" suggests biopsies, as RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. However, the text doesn't explicitly state which procedure was done. Since it's talking about sampling from standard locations and mentions that one sample isn't representative, it's likely a biopsy. But I need to be careful. The report doesn't use the exact terms like "biopsia" (biopsy in Finnish), but "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" means tissue processed as samples. Given the context, I'll go with "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says that the sample material isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions no atypical structures were observed. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to insufficient material but didn't find any signs, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no). However, the note about insufficient material might complicate things. But the key point is that no malignancy was detected in the examined samples, even though they can't fully rule it out. So "ei" seems appropriate here.

For the Gleason grade, since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma, and the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't provide any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected. Even if there was uncertainty due to insufficient material, the absence of confirmed malignancy means Gleason isn't applicable.

Wait, but the user specified that for non-malignant cases, Gleason is NA. So that's correct. Let me double-check the original text. It says "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman... läsnäoloa" which means the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma. So they can't confirm it's there, but they didn't find any. So malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

Original sample type: biopsy. Presence of malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. That should be the answer.
