Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The term "näyttöönottokohtia" refers to biopsy sites. So the original sample type is likely "biopsy". There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so biopsy fits here.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions no atypical structures. Since they can't confirm malignancy and there's no mention of actual cancer found, the answer here should be "ei" (no). But wait, the absence of sufficient material might complicate things. However, the key point is that no malignancy was detected in the examined sample. So "ei" is correct.

Lastly, Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason score should be "NA". Even if there were some mention, the report doesn't provide specific grades like 3+4=7 or similar. So definitely "NA" here.

Double-checking each part. Sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. That seems right. No nested structures, just the three fields as specified.
