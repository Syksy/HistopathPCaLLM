Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into specific JSON fields. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the report mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" which translates to "several sampling sites". The term "näytteenotto" usually refers to a biopsy. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so the sample type is likely "biopsy". However, the report also states that one sample doesn't seem representative because it lacks normal prostate tissue, but the rest are representative. Since the main method mentioned is sampling from standard locations, "biopsy" seems correct.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says that there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of such changes. However, the key point here is whether any malignancy was found. Since they couldn't find any, but the sample might be inadequate, does that count as "ei" (no) or "NA"? The instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is "NA" because they can't confirm. But the report states that in the examined tissue, there are no atypical structures. So even though the sample might not be sufficient, based on what's observed, there's no malignancy. So maybe "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade would be "NA".

Wait, but the user said to take into account that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the structured output shouldn't have nested structures. Also, the sample type: the user might have to check if "biopsy" is correct. The term "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" refers to processed tissue as samples, which is consistent with biopsy. So sample type is "biopsy".

Malignancy: The report says no evidence of adenocarcinoma or PIN. So "ei".

Gleason grade: Since no malignancy, "NA".

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and that the values are correctly mapped. Also, check if the sample type is correctly identified. The report doesn't mention RP or TURP, so biopsy is the right choice here. The malignancy is negative based on the findings, even though the sample might be insufficient, but the conclusion is that no malignancy was found. Hence, "ei" is appropriate.

  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
