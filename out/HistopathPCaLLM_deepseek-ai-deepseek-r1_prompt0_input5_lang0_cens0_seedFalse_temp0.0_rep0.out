Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line says "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy..." So that clearly indicates the sample type is RP. Got that.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." Cancerous tissue would be malignant, so the answer here is yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum as whole numbers. The text mentions two macros, A and B. In macro A, it's 4+3=7. In macro B, it's 4+5=9. The user specified to take the most severe lesion. Between 7 and 9, 9 is higher. So the Gleason grade should be 4+5=9. Even though the sum is 9, the user wants the format major+minor=sum, so writing it as "4+5=9" makes sense. But wait, the allowed values mention "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers". So maybe just "4+5=9" as a string. The example in the instructions shows "major+minor=sum" as the format, so I should follow that exactly. Also, the user said to take the most severe lesion, which is the higher sum. So macro B's 4+5=9 is the correct one.

Let me double-check. The sample type is RP. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 4+5=9. No nested structures, just flat JSON. All fields accounted for. No other values needed. Looks good.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
