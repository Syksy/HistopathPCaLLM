Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "radical prostatectomy," which is abbreviated as RP. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the second answer is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The text describes two macros, A and B. Macro A is 4+3=7, but Macro B has a higher sum of 4+5=9. Since we need the most severe, the Gleason should be 4+5=9. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum", so "4+5=9".

I need to make sure the JSON is valid and there's no nesting. Let me double-check the allowed values. All entries look correct. No other details needed. Alright, that's it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
