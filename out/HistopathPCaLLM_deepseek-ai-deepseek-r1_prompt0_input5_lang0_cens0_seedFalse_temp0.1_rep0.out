Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy..." So that's RP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. RP is clearly indicated here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which is a clear indication of malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

Now the Gleason grade. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7. Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the most severe is 4+5=9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Check each field again. Sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. All values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. No issues here.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```
