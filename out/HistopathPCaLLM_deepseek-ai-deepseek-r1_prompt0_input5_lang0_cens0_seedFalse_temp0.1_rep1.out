Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy," which is abbreviated as RP. So the allowed value here is "RP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." so that's a clear indication of malignancy. The answer here should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two macros, A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7, but Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher, we should take that. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+5=9". The user prefers whole numbers, and since this is a malignant case, we don't use NA.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, with no nested structures. Also, check that all values are correctly mapped. No other details should be included. Let me double-check each part again to confirm.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```
