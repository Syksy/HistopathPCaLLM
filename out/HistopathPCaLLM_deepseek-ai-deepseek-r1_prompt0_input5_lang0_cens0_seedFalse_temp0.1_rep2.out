Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathological report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, the first line mentions "radical prostatectomy," so that's RP. Easy enough.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." so that's a clear yes. Even though there's mention of other areas being clean, the main lesion is malignant.

Now the Gleason grade. The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. The report has two macros mentioned: A and B. Macro A is 4+3=7, and Macro B is 4+5=9. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. Between 7 and 9, 9 is higher. So the Gleason should be 4+5=9. Need to check if the formatting is correct. The user prefers "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So "4+5=9" is the right format here.

Wait, the example in the problem statement shows "major+minor=sum" as the format. So the answer should be a string like "4+5=9". The user also mentions that for benign cases, it's NA. Since this is malignant, we use the sum from the most severe lesion, which is 9. So the Gleason grade is 4+5=9.

Double-checking the sample type again: radical prostatectomy is RP. Malignant is yes. Gleason is 4+5=9. All other parts like seminal vehicles being clean don't affect the most severe lesion. The answer should be in JSON without nested structures. So the final JSON should have those three keys with the respective values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
