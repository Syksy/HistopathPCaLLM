Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as coming from a "relatively enlarged prostate" and mentions samples taken from apex and basis. The processing involves sections with dyes, but there's no mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't explicitly stated. So I might have to go with NA here since the information isn't clear.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue," which suggests no malignancy. Also, it says that Gleason classes couldn't be inferred, which might imply that there's no malignancy detected. However, there's a mention of "suspected higher sum one" referred for further inspection. But since the major and minor Gleason couldn't be determined, and the tissue is clear, maybe the answer is "no" for malignancy. But I need to be careful here. Clear tissue usually means no cancer, but the referral for further inspection might indicate suspicion. However, the task says to report the most severe lesion. Since the main observation is clear tissue, maybe "no" is correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is likely "no", this should be NA. Additionally, the text explicitly states that major and minor Gleason classes couldn't be inferred, which supports using NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since the method isn't specified)
2. Malignant tumor: no (because the tissue is clear)
3. Gleason grade: NA (no malignancy, and grades couldn't be inferred)
