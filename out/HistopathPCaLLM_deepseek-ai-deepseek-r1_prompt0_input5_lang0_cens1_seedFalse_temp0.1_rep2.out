Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "the sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate." But there's no specific mention of how the sample was obtained. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So I think the answer here is NA because the information isn't provided.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." Clear tissue suggests no malignancy. Also, it mentions that major and minor Gleason classes couldn't be inferred, which might imply no malignancy since Gleason grading is for cancer. So the answer here is likely "no."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the previous answer is "no" for malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. Additionally, the text explicitly states that major and minor classes couldn't be determined, reinforcing that there's no Gleason score provided.

Wait, but the user said to take the most severe lesion. The text mentions a suspected higher sum referred for further inspection. However, since the main samples are clear and the higher sum is only suspected but not confirmed, maybe we should still stick with "no" for malignancy and NA for Gleason. The key is that the most severe confirmed lesion is the one with clear tissue. The suspected higher sum isn't confirmed, so it's not reported here.

So final answers: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA.
