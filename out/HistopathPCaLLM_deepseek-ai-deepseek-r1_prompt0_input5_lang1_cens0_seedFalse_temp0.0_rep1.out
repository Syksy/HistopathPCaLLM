Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line says "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. So the answer for the first field should be "RP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) in both apex macro blocks (A+B). Also, there are Gleason scores provided. Since there's tumor tissue and Gleason scores, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the worst lesion. The report has two entries: in macro A, it's 4+3, and in macro B, it's 4+5 with a sum of 9. The highest sum is 9 (4+5), so the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9". Even though macro B's components are 4+5, the sum is 9, which is higher than 4+3=7. So the correct format is major + minor = sum, which in this case is 4+5=9.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion. The other blocks are clean, so we don't consider them. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
