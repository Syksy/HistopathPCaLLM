Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so that's the answer here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." Kasvainkudosta means tumor tissue, which is malignant. So the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the highest score is needed. The text mentions two areas: in macro A, it's 4+3=7, and in macro B, it's 4+5=9. The highest sum is 9. The user specified "major+minor=sum" format. So the answer is "4+5=9".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's result. The other blocks are clean, so only the 4+5=9 is reported. All other fields check out as per the allowed values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
