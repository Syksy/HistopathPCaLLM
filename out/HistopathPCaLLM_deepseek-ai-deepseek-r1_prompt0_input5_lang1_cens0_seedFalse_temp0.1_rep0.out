Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one.

1. **Sample Type**: The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report starts with "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. So the sample type should be "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)" which means cancerous tissue was found in both apex macros. So the answer here is "kyllä".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The format is major+minor=sum. The report states two areas: in macro A, it's 4+3 (sum 7), and in macro B, 4+5 (sum 9). Since we need the worst lesion, which is the highest sum, that's 4+5=9. However, the instructions say to report the major and minor components, not the sum. Wait, the user specified "major+minor=sum" as the format. So for the worst lesion (macro B), it's 4+5=9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The other blocks (C-J) are clean, so the worst is indeed the 4+5=9 from macro B. All other details like weight of the prostate or absence of capsule penetration aren't relevant here. So the JSON should reflect these three points accurately.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
