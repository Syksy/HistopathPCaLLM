Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the answer here should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant findings. The text says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." Kasvainkudosta means tumor tissue, which is malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the instructions specify the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. The report mentions two areas: in macro A, it's 4+3, and macro B is 4+5. Since we need the worst lesion, which has the highest sum, 4+5=9 is worse than 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. All values are straightforward. The other blocks are clean, so no other Gleason scores are relevant. The answer should be in JSON with the three keys and the determined values.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+5=9"
}
```
