Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the three fields to extract: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The report starts with "radikaali prostatektomia". "Radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So here, the original type is RP.

2. **Malignant Findings**: The text mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) in both apex macro sections (A+B). Also, there are Gleason scores provided. Since there's tumor tissue and Gleason scores, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The user wants the worst lesion's result. The report has two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3, and Macro B has 4+5 with a higher sum (9). The worst is 4+5=9. So the Gleason grade should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the instructions say to report the major + minor = sum. So for the worst lesion (Macro B), it's 4+5=9. So the correct format is "4+5=9".

Checking again: The sample type is RP, malignant findings are present, and the highest Gleason is 4+5=9. All other blocks are clean, so no higher scores elsewhere. The answer should be structured accordingly.
