Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as coming from a "verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta" (a relatively enlarged prostate). The mention of apex and basis samples being taken and processed with different colors (yellow and green) for left and right sections. But there's no mention of TURP or RP. The terms used are "näytekappale" (specimen) and "näytteet" (samples), which might suggest biopsy, but I'm not sure. The report also mentions that the samples are indexed from A to H, which is common in biopsies. However, sometimes RP specimens are also sectioned. But since there's no explicit mention of surgery like RP or TURP, maybe it's a biopsy. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, if the original sample is from a prostatectomy, but the text doesn't state that. The safest bet here might be NA, but I need to check again. The first sentence says "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." So the specimen is from an enlarged prostate. Without more specific info on the procedure, maybe it's a biopsy. But I'm not 100% sure. Wait, TURP is a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed to relieve symptoms, often in enlarged prostates. But the text doesn't mention TURP. Hmm. The user might expect "biopsy" here, but if the sample is from a TURP, that's possible. However, since it's not explicitly stated, maybe NA is better. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The report talks about apex and basis samples, which are standard biopsy sites. So maybe it's a biopsy. So answer 1: "biopsy".

Second, presence of malignancy. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" (cannot reliably determine major and minor Gleason grades). Also mentions "epäilty suurempi summa" (suspected higher sum) referred for further investigation. But does that mean there are malignant findings? The fact that Gleason grading is attempted suggests malignancy, but the report says they can't reliably determine it. However, the presence of "erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja" (various cellular architectures) between the macros might indicate cancer. But the key point is whether malignant findings are present. The user's instruction is to answer "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since they couldn't reliably determine Gleason but there's suspicion, maybe the answer is "kyllä". Because if they are considering Gleason grades, that implies malignancy. So answer 2: "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The user wants "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the presence is "kyllä", but they couldn't reliably determine major and minor grades. The text says "ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään käyttäen kynnysarvoa kuten 50%." So they can't assign a major or minor because the threshold (like 50%) isn't met. Therefore, no specific Gleason sum can be given. But the question says to report the Gleason for malignant cases. However, if it's not possible, maybe the answer is "NA". Wait, the instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa... ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)". Since the case is malignant (answer 2 is "kyllä"), but the Gleason couldn't be determined, should it be NA? Or is there any reported sum? The text mentions "epäilty suurempi summa" but it's referred for further testing. So the actual reported Gleason isn't given. Therefore, answer 3: "NA".

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Näyte on otettu laajentuneesta prostatasta (biopsia), eikä RP/TURP-proseduuria mainita suoraan.
2. Gleason-luokan epäiltiin olevan mahdollinen (viittaukset soluarkkitehtuureihin ja jatkotutkimuksiin), vaikka luokittelua ei voitu varmuudella tehdä.
3. Gleason-summaa ei raportoitu (viittaus kynnysarvon epävarmuuteen ja jatkotutkimuksiin).
