Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the original sample is described as "näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." The terms used here don't clearly indicate a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The mention of samples from apex and basis might suggest a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. Since there's no clear indication, I think the answer here is NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" and "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten." This suggests that there are some suspicious findings, but they can't reliably determine the Gleason grades. However, the presence of different architectural patterns and the referral for further testing might imply malignancy. But the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The user instructions say to answer "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. Since it's uncertain and needs further review, maybe the answer is "ei" or "kyllä"? Wait, the text says "epäilty suurempi summa" which is suspected higher sum, but not confirmed. The user might consider this as not confirmed malignancy, so perhaps "ei"? But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If they can't determine Gleason reliably but there are suspicious areas, does that count as malignant? Hmm. The key is that the user specified "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe the answer is "ei". But the presence of "erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja" (various cell architectures) could indicate cancer. However, without a confirmed Gleason score, maybe it's still uncertain. The report also mentions that the capsule is intact and no perineural invasion, which might suggest no malignancy. I'm a bit confused here. Let me re-read the text. The main points: they can't reliably determine major and minor Gleason grades using a 50% threshold. Different architectures are observed, and a suspected higher sum is referred. But no definitive malignancy stated. So perhaps the answer is "kyllä" because there are findings that are suspected, even if not confirmed? Or "ei" because it's not confirmed? The user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the findings are suspected but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the system requires a yes/no. Alternatively, if the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, maybe it's "ei". This is tricky. Let me check the original text again. The report says "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" – so a suspected higher sum is referred. But does that mean there are malignant findings? If they are referring for further tests, maybe they found something concerning but not definitive. In medical terms, if there's a suspicion but not confirmation, the report might not state malignancy. So perhaps the answer here is "ei" because it's not confirmed. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the presence of Gleason grading attempts implies malignancy. Wait, the text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" – so they tried to assign Gleason grades but couldn't reliably do so. Gleason grading is for cancer, so if they attempted it, that suggests there's cancer present. Therefore, the answer for question 2 would be "kyllä". But the user instructions say to only report the worst lesion's results. So if there's cancer, even if Gleason can't be reliably determined, the presence is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Since they couldn't reliably determine major and minor grades using the 50% threshold, and different architectures are observed, but a suspected higher sum is referred. However, the report doesn't provide specific numbers. So the Gleason grade can't be determined here. But the presence of malignancy (if we answered "kyllä" to question 2) would require a Gleason score. But since it's not reliably determined, the answer here is "NA". Wait, the user instructions say: for malignant findings, report Gleason as "major+minor=sum", and "NA" for benign. If the sample is malignant but Gleason can't be determined, do we put "NA"? The problem says "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" (for malignant findings) the format is sum, otherwise "NA". So if there are malignant findings but Gleason isn't determined, perhaps the answer is "NA". But the user might expect that if malignancy is present, Gleason should be reported. However, in this case, it's stated that they can't reliably determine it, so the answer is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (since it's not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings: kyllä (since they attempted Gleason grading, implying cancer presence)
3. Gleason: NA (because it couldn't be reliably determined)

Wait, but the user instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset" (only the worst lesion's results). The text mentions "epäilty suurempi summa" (suspected higher sum), but no numbers. So even if they suspect a higher sum, if it's not reported, we can't include it. Therefore, Gleason remains NA.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei mainita eksplisiittisesti (ei viittauksia biopsy, RP tai TURP -termiin), joten arvo "NA".
2. Löydöksiin viitataan epäsuorasti Gleason-luokittelun yrityksen ja epäiltyjen arkkitehtuurimuutosten kautta, mikä viittaa pahanlaatuisuuteen ("kyllä"). 
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei pystytty määrittelemään luotettavasti (viittaukset kynnysarvon ongelmiin ja jatkotutkimuksiin), joten "NA".
