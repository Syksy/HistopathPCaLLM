Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." Translating that, it says the sample is from an enlarged prostate. However, the terms biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't explicitly mentioned. The text later talks about samples taken from apex and basis, which are parts of the prostate. Since there's no clear indication of the procedure type like TURP or biopsy, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which means they can't reliably determine the major and minor Gleason grades. However, the presence of Gleason grading attempts suggests there's some malignancy. Also, "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" implies suspicion of a higher sum, indicating possible malignancy. But the text doesn't explicitly say "malignant" or "cancer." However, since Gleason grading is mentioned in the context of not being able to determine reliably, it's likely that there are malignant findings. So the answer here would be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the user wants a "major+minor=sum" format if malignant. The text says they can't reliably determine the major and minor grades using a 50% threshold. So there's no specific Gleason score provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA" because it's not specified, even though malignancy is suspected. Wait, but the third field's allowed values are "sum" for malignant cases and "NA" for benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "kyllä," but the Gleason isn't given, maybe it's still "NA"? The instructions say to report the Gleason only for malignant cases, but if it's not available, then "NA" even if malignant. So in this case, since they couldn't determine it, the answer is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is yes, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The sample type: the text mentions apex and basis samples, which are typically from a biopsy or prostatectomy. But the original sample type isn't specified. The user might expect biopsy if it's a needle biopsy, but the report doesn't say. So NA is safe. Malignancy: the mention of Gleason grading implies cancer, even if uncertain. Gleason: not specified, so NA. That seems right.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**  
1. Alkuperäistä näytteenottotapaa (biopsia, RP, TURP) ei mainita suoraan raportissa, joten arvo on "NA".  
2. Gleason-luokituksen epämääräinen maininta ("ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään") ja jatkotutkimuksia vaativa epäilys ("epäilty suurempi summa") viittaavat pahanlaatuisuuteen.  
3. Gleason-luokkaa ei raportoitu selkeästi (ei numeerista summaa), joten arvo on "NA".
