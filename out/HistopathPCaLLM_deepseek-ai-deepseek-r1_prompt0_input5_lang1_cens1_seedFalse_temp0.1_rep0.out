Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, identifying the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the original sample is described as "alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta" which translates to a relatively enlarged prostate. However, the terms RP or TURP aren't mentioned. The report mentions taking samples from apex and basis, which are parts of the prostate. Since there's no clear indication of RP or TURP, and it's a biopsy from different sections, maybe the type is biopsy. But wait, the Finnish term for biopsy is "koepalaute" or "näyte", but the text says "näytekappale" which is a sample piece. However, the options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. If the report doesn't specify the exact procedure, maybe it's safer to put NA. But the mention of "alun perin" (originally) might refer to the sample being a biopsy. Hmm, not sure. Let me check again. The text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type, so maybe NA is better here.

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" which means they can't reliably determine the major and minor Gleason grades. Also, "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" implies suspicion of a higher sum, but not confirmed. However, the presence of Gleason grading attempts suggests malignancy. But the key point is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Wait, the original text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" which indicates that they tried to assess Gleason grades, which are for cancer. So even if they can't determine the exact grades, the presence of Gleason grading suggests malignancy. Therefore, the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes). But wait, the user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since they can't reliably determine Gleason, but there's suspicion, maybe it's still considered malignant. Alternatively, if no definite malignancy is found, maybe "ei". Wait, the report says "epäilty suurempi summa" which is suspected higher sum, but not confirmed. However, the presence of Gleason grading attempts usually implies cancer. But the user's second question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If they couldn't determine Gleason reliably, but there's a suspicion, does that count as malignant? The answer might be "kyllä" because they are considering Gleason, which is for cancer. Alternatively, if no definite cancer is found, maybe "ei". The text also says "prostatakudosta kaikissa basis ja apex näytteenotoissa" which is normal prostate tissue. But then mentions different architectures and suspected higher sum. So maybe there's malignancy. I think the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text says they can't reliably determine major and minor grades using a 50% threshold. So they can't assign specific numbers. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA". But wait, the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "kyllä", but they couldn't determine the grades, does that mean Gleason is "NA"? The instructions say to report the Gleason only for malignant cases. But if it's not determined, then "NA". So yes, in this case, even though malignancy is present, if the Gleason isn't specified, it's "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. The sample is from apex and basis, which could be biopsy cores, but since the original sample type isn't specified, maybe NA. Wait, the first sentence says "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." "Alun perin" might mean the original sample type. But without knowing the procedure (biopsy, RP, etc.), maybe NA. So sample type is NA.

2. Malignancy: Yes, because they attempted Gleason grading, even if inconclusive.

3. Gleason: NA because it couldn't be determined.

Wait, but the user instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset" (only the worst lesion's results). If there's a suspicion of a higher sum, but it's referred for further testing, does that mean the worst lesion's Gleason is not determined here? So Gleason remains NA.

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "kyllä",
  "3": "NA"
}
