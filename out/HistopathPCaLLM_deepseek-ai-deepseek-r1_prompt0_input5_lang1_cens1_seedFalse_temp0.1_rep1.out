Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." The terms here don't clearly indicate a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of sections from apex and base might suggest a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. Since there's no direct mention of the procedure type, I think the safest answer here is NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" which implies that Gleason grading was attempted but couldn't be reliably determined. However, the presence of Gleason grading attempts usually indicates malignancy. Also, phrases like "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" suggest suspicion of malignancy needing further review. So, even though it's not definitive, the presence of Gleason considerations points towards "kyllä" (yes) for malignant findings.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant. The text states that major and minor grades can't be reliably determined using a 50% threshold. Since they can't specify the grades, there's no sum provided. However, the question specifies that for malignant cases, we should report the Gleason. But if it's not determinable, maybe we still put NA? Wait, the instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot 'major+minor=sum' muodossa... ja 'NA' hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." Since the malignancy is present (kyllä), but the Gleason couldn't be determined, should we put NA here? The problem is that the user's instructions say that for malignant cases, the Gleason should be in the sum format. However, in this case, the report says they couldn't reliably determine the major and minor. So perhaps the correct answer is NA here as well, even though malignancy is present. But the allowed values for Gleason are either the sum or NA for benign. Hmm. Wait, the third field's allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant cases, and NA for benign. Since the case is malignant (kyllä), but the Gleason couldn't be determined, maybe the answer is NA. But the user might expect that if malignancy is present, Gleason should be reported. However, the text explicitly states that they can't reliably define the major and minor grades. Therefore, the correct entry here is NA. So even though it's malignant, the Gleason isn't reported, so NA.

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: kyllä (because Gleason was considered, even if inconclusive)
3. Gleason grade: NA (since it couldn't be determined)
