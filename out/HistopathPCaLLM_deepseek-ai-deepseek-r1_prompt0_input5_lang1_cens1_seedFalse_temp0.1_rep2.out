Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each part of the report carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." Translating that, it says the sample is from an enlarged prostate. But the original type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). There's no mention of the procedure type, so I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which means they couldn't reliably determine the Gleason grades. However, there's mention of "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" – suspecting a higher sum and referring for further tests. This suggests there are some concerning findings, possibly malignant. But the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The presence of Gleason grading attempts (even if inconclusive) might imply malignancy. But since it's not confirmed, maybe "kyllä" (yes) because they are considering it, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't determine Gleason reliably, but there's suspicion, does that count as malignant? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since they are referring for further tests due to suspected higher sum, maybe it's considered malignant. But the report also says "ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" which could mean it's uncertain. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because they are mentioning Gleason grades, even if inconclusive. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" – worst lesion. If they can't determine, maybe it's still considered malignant. I think the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA". The text states they couldn't reliably determine the major and minor grades using a 50% threshold. So they can't assign specific numbers. However, the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Since they can't determine, maybe the Gleason is "NA". But wait, the question says to use "NA" only for benign findings. If the malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason should be reported. But in this case, they couldn't determine the grades. The user might expect "NA" here, but the instructions specify "NA" for benign. Since malignancy is "kyllä", but Gleason couldn't be determined, maybe the answer is "NA" even though it's malignant. But the allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" or "NA" (for benign). So if the sample is malignant but Gleason isn't reported, how to handle? The report says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään", which means they can't reliably assign major and minor. Therefore, the Gleason grade can't be determined, so even though it's malignant, the answer is "NA". But according to the user's instructions, "hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille" (benign findings) use "NA". But here, it's malignant but Gleason not determined. The user might expect "NA" in this case. So the Gleason field is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: kyllä (since they are considering Gleason, even if inconclusive)
3. Gleason: NA (couldn't determine)

Wait, but maybe the malignancy should be "ei" if they can't confirm. Let me recheck. The report mentions "epäilty suurempi summa" (suspected higher sum) referred for further tests. So there's suspicion but not confirmed. Does that count as malignant? The presence of Gleason grading attempt usually implies cancer, but if it's inconclusive, maybe it's still considered malignant. Alternatively, if they can't confirm, maybe it's "ei". But the user instructions say to take the worst lesion. If they can't determine, but there's suspicion, perhaps the answer is "kyllä". I think the correct answer here is "kyllä" for malignancy, and Gleason as "NA".
