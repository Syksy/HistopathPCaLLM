Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The input text mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue cassettes." Shaving chips are typically from a TURP procedure, which stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. So the original sample type should be TURP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. TURP fits here.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The report states "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "findings hint at benign prostate hyperplasia." Benign means no malignancy. So the answer here is "no."

For Gleason grade, since there's no mention of cancer or malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The allowed value is NA in such cases.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but since everything here is benign, there's no conflicting information. The JSON should be flat without nesting. Let me double-check the terms. Yes, TURP is correct for the sample type. Malignant is "no," and Gleason is NA. That should cover it.
