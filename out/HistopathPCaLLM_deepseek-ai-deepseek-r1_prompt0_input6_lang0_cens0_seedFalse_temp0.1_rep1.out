Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The raw data mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue cassettes." Shaving chips are typically from a TURP procedure, which stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. So the original sample type should be "TURP."

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions that glands are largely unobservable due to artifacts but still suggests it's benign. There's no mention of malignancy, so the answer here is "no."

For the Gleason grade, since the findings are benign and there's no indication of cancer, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The allowed value here is "NA."

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but in this case, the report is benign, so there's no severe lesion to report. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting. Let me double-check the allowed values for each field to ensure accuracy. Everything seems to fit: TURP for sample type, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason. Alright, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
