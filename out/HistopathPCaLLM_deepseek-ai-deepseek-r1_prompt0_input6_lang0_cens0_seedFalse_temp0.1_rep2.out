Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The raw data mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue cassettes." Shaving chips are typically from a TURP procedure, which stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. So the original sample type should be "TURP."

Next, checking for malignant findings. The report states "benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions that glands are largely unobservable due to artifacts but still points to benign. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy. So malignant tumor findings would be "no."

For the Gleason grade, since the diagnosis is benign, there's no Gleason score provided. The allowed value here is "NA" because it's a benign case. Even if there were some mention, since the highest severity lesion is benign, we don't report a Gleason score.

Putting it all together: sample type is TURP, malignant findings are no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without any nested structures. Let me double-check the terms allowed. Yes, TURP is allowed, and "NA" for Gleason when benign. Looks good.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
