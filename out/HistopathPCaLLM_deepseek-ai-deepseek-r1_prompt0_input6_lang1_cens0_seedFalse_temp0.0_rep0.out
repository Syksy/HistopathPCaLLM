Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". From what I remember, TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically yields chip-like samples, while a biopsy would be smaller pieces or cores. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the whole gland, which isn't the case here. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" which means relatively normal prostate tissue. There's mention of "prostatahyperplasia", which is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement. No signs of cancer like adenocarcinoma or malignancy indicators. So the presence of malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were some changes, unless it's specified as cancer, Gleason isn't applicable here.

Double-checking each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. No malignancy found, so "ei". Gleason is "NA". All fields seem to fit the allowed values. No nested structures, just straightforward answers. Looks good.
