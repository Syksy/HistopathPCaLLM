Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format. Let me start by understanding each requirement.

First, the sample's original type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically produces such chips. Biopsy would be needle cores, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is the entire gland. So here, the type should be TURP.

Second, whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and mentions "prostatahyperplasia", which is benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of cancer, so the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. Since there are no malignant findings, the value should be "NA". If there were cancer, we'd need to look for patterns like 3+4=7 or similar, but that's not the case here.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. The findings are benign, so malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA". No nested structures needed, just straightforward answers. Everything seems to fit.
