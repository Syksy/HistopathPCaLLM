Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings," which is typical for a TURP procedure. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "prostatahyperplasia" (prostatic hyperplasia). Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's no mention of cancer, carcinoma, or any malignant terms. So the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is major + minor = sum. However, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So Gleason grade is NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatahyperplasia" is definitely benign. The sample type is TURP because of the "höyläyslastuja," which aligns with TURP samples being chips. No mention of biopsy or RP. 

Everything seems to fit. The answer should be a JSON with those three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
