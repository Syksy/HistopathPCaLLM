Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key word here is "fragmentoituneista" which means fragmented. The original sample type might be TURP because TURP specimens are often fragmented. Biopsy samples are also fragmented, but the mention of "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" (prostate treatment material) might lean towards TURP. However, the text doesn't explicitly state TURP or RP. Since it's unclear, maybe NA is safer. But I need to check if there's a standard here. Sometimes TURP is considered when dealing with fragmented samples from prostate treatment. Hmm, but the user might expect TURP here. Let me think again. The sample is from the original prostate treatment material, which is fragmented. TURP is a common procedure that results in fragmented samples. So I'll go with TURP.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" which means relatively normal prostate tissue. However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to burn artifacts. The conclusion is that the results are unclear. Since there's no mention of cancer, but the examination is inconclusive, should we mark it as ei (no) or NA? The key is whether malignant findings were present. The report states that the visible tissue is normal, but due to artifacts, they can't assess properly. So there's no definite malignancy found, but it's unclear. The question is, "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" If no malignancy is detected, even if inconclusive, maybe the answer is ei. But if the results are uncertain, maybe NA. However, the instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Since they didn't find any malignancy in the parts they could examine, even if some areas couldn't be assessed, the answer would be ei. But I need to be careful. The report says "epäselvät" (unclear) and recommends re-examination. So maybe the presence is NA because it's uncertain. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they didn't find any, but couldn't assess parts, the answer would be ei, because the detected parts are normal. But if the uncertainty is such that malignancy can't be ruled out, maybe NA. The user's instruction says to take the worst lesion's results. Since no malignancy was found in the examined parts, the answer is ei. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The text says "valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia" (most of the material can't be examined), but the visible parts are normal. So the findings are negative, but the test is inconclusive. The presence of malignancy is ei because no malignancy was found in the examined areas, even though some areas couldn't be assessed. So answer is ei.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the presence is ei (no malignancy), the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some uncertainty, since no malignancy was detected, Gleason isn't applicable. So NA.

Putting it all together: sample type TURP, malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
