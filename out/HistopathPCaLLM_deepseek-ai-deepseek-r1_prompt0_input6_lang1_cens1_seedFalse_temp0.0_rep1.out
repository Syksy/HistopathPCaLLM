Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key word here is "fragmentoituneista," which suggests fragmented samples. The original procedure isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" (prostate treatment material), but without a specific procedure named. So, the sample type is unclear, hence NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) but also mentions "valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia riittävän tarkasti johtuen vahvasta polttoartefaktasta" (most of the sample can't be examined due to burn artifacts). Since the visible parts are normal, but a large portion is unassessable, there's no clear evidence of malignancy. However, the results are inconclusive ("epäselvät") and recommend re-examination. But the question is strictly about presence of malignant findings. Since no malignancy is reported, the answer is "ei" (no), but wait, the report says the results are unclear. However, the presence is only "kyllä" or "ei" or NA. Since the visible parts are normal and no malignancy is found in the examined areas, even if some parts couldn't be assessed, the answer should be "ei". If there was uncertainty but no positive findings, it's "ei". If unsure but possible, maybe NA? But the options are kyllä, ei, NA. The report doesn't state any malignancy found, so "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. Since the answer to the second question is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some issues, if no malignancy is detected, Gleason isn't applicable. So "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. Original sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no malignancy found in assessable parts)
3. Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)
