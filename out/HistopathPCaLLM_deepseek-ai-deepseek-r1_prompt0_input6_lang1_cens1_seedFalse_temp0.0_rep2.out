Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia", which translates to "original prostate treatment material". However, the text doesn't mention the specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just refers to fragmented parts of the original material. So, the sample type isn't clearly stated, so I should go with "NA".

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which means "Microscopically, relatively normal prostate tissue is seen...". However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to burn artifacts ("valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia riittävän tarkasti johtuen vahvasta polttoartefaktasta"). The conclusion is that the results are unclear and re-examination is recommended. Since the visible parts are normal but the majority can't be assessed, there's no clear evidence of malignancy. But the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed either. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the report says the visible parts are normal, and the rest can't be assessed, the answer here would be "ei" (no), because no malignancy was found in the examined parts. But wait, the results are unclear, so maybe "NA"? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the visible parts are normal, even if some areas couldn't be assessed, the worst found is benign. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

So the structured data would be:
1. "NA" for sample type.
2. "ei" for malignancy.
3. "NA" for Gleason.
