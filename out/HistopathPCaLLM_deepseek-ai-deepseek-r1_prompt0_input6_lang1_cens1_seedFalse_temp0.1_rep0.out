Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia", which translates to original prostate treatment material. However, the text doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It mentions the samples are fragmented and processed in three batches, but there's no clear indication of the procedure type. So I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which means microscopically, relatively normal prostate tissue is seen. However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to severe burning artifacts ("valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia riittävän tarkasti johtuen vahvasta polttoartefaktasta"). The results are unclear and re-examination is recommended. Since the visible parts are normal but the majority is unclear, there's no definitive evidence of malignancy. But the presence of artifacts might obscure potential findings. However, the report doesn't explicitly state any malignancy, so the safest answer here is "ei" (no), but I need to be cautious. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the visible parts are normal and the rest can't be assessed, then technically, no malignancy was found in the examined parts. But the report says the results are unclear. However, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the findings are inconclusive but no malignancy is reported, maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the uncertainty is such that malignancy can't be ruled out, maybe "NA". Hmm. The instructions say to answer based on whether malignant findings were present. If the report says "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" and the rest is unclear, then the answer would be "ei" because no malignancy was detected in the examined parts. But if the artifacts prevent proper assessment, maybe "NA". The key is whether the presence of malignancy is confirmed. Since it's not confirmed and the results are unclear, perhaps "NA" is better. Wait, the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The user instruction says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the report doesn't mention any malignancy and the findings are unclear, but the visible parts are normal, then the answer is "ei". But if the uncertainty is such that they can't determine, maybe "NA". The text says "Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät" (results are unclear) and recommends re-examination. So maybe the presence can't be determined, hence "NA". But the visible parts are normal. So in the examined parts, no malignancy, but the rest couldn't be assessed. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the sample is partially examined and no malignancy found there, but the rest is unclear, the answer might still be "ei" because no malignancy was found in the parts they could examine. However, the report states that due to technical issues, the results are unclear. So perhaps the presence can't be reliably assessed, leading to "NA". This is a bit ambiguous, but I think "ei" is safer here because they mention seeing normal tissue, even if part is unclear. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The original text: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa, mutta valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia... Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät". So the majority couldn't be examined, but the part that was examined was normal. So in the examined parts, no malignancy. But since most couldn't be assessed, maybe the presence of malignancy is uncertain. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since none were found in the examined parts, and the rest couldn't be assessed, the answer would be "ei" because no positive findings. Alternatively, if the uncertainty is such that they can't say for sure, maybe "NA". The instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – so only the worst lesion's results. But in this case, no lesion was found in the examined parts. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since in this case, if the answer to question 2 is "ei", then Gleason would be "NA". If the answer were "kyllä", then we'd need the Gleason score. But since the answer here is "ei", then Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no)
3. Gleason: NA

Wait, but the sample type mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" which could be from a procedure. The term "käsittelymateriaalia" translates to treatment material. Common prostate procedures are TURP, biopsy, or RP. But the text doesn't specify which. It just says the original prostate treatment material. So without knowing the exact procedure, it's NA.

Yes, that makes sense. So the final JSON would be:

{
  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}

```json

  "1": "NA",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
