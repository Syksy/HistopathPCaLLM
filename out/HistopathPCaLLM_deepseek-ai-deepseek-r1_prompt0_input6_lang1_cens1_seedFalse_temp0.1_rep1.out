Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" which translates to original prostate treatment material. The text mentions that the samples are fragmented and processed in three separate batches. Terms like "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) might be related. However, the exact procedure isn't clearly stated as TURP or biopsy. Since it's fragmented and possibly from a surgical procedure, but not explicitly stated, I might have to go with "NA" here because it's not clear if it's RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP.

Next, the presence of malignant findings. The text says "verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" which means relatively normal prostate tissue. However, most of the material couldn't be examined properly due to cautery artifacts. The results are unclear, and re-examination is recommended. Since there's no mention of cancer cells, just that the results are inconclusive, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because no malignancy was identified, but the report states the results are unclear. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the examination couldn't confirm due to artifacts, maybe it's "NA"? But the user instructions say to answer based on whether malignant findings were present. The text doesn't mention any malignancy, just normal tissue where visible. So maybe "ei" is correct here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. However, in this case, there's no malignancy found, so Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text. It mentions "verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" – relatively normal prostate tissue. The rest couldn't be examined due to cautery artifacts. So no malignancy detected, hence Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: The text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. It mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" which is vague. So "NA".
2. Malignant findings: No, so "ei".
3. Gleason: "NA".
