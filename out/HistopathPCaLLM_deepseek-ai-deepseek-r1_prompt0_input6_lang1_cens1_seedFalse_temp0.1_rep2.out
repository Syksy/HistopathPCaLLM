Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key word here is "fragmentoituneista," which means fragmented. The original sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The report mentions that the material is from prostate treatment, but since it's fragmented and processed in three batches, maybe it's from a TURP? Wait, TURP often yields fragmented samples, but the text doesn't explicitly state TURP. The original type isn't specified, so I should go with NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report says "verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" which translates to relatively normal prostate tissue. However, most of the material couldn't be examined properly due to burn artifacts. The results are unclear, and re-examination is recommended. Since there's no mention of cancer cells or malignancy detected, but the examination was inconclusive, should I mark this as "ei" or NA? The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If no malignancy is found but the results are unclear, maybe the answer is "ei" because the visible parts are normal. But the uncertainty might lead to NA. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they couldn't examine properly, but what they saw was normal, then maybe "ei". But the report states the results are unclear. Hmm. The presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe "ei" if no malignancy was found in the examined parts. The text says "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" so no malignancy detected in the parts they could examine. So answer "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even though the results are unclear, if no malignancy is reported, Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA (since it's not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
2. Malignant findings: ei (because the examined parts were normal)
3. Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)
