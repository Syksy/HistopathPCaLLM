Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the method. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't present. Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but states that the finding was too small to draw definite conclusions. The rest of the material was typical. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and the report is inconclusive, the answer here should be "no". However, I need to be careful. The key phrase is "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the rest is typical. So, it's more like they didn't find enough evidence to say yes, but it's not a clear benign either. Wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. Since the findings were inconclusive but not confirmed as malignant, maybe "no" is appropriate. Alternatively, if the presence of atypical structures is considered suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "NA" applies. But according to the instructions, "NA" is for benign statements. Wait, the third question says "NA" for benign. But the second question's allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "no definite conclusions" but the rest is normal. So, the most severe lesion here is the atypical structures, but it's not confirmed as malignant. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "no" because there's no definite malignant finding. Alternatively, if the presence of atypical structures is considered as possible malignancy but not confirmed, maybe "NA" is better. But the user says to return the most severe lesion. The most severe here is the atypical structures, but since it's inconclusive, maybe the answer is "no" because they can't confirm malignancy. So, "no" for malignant tumor findings.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignant is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. So the final answer should be a JSON object with those three keys and values.

  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
