Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the method of collection. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, the sample type isn't explicitly stated here. Therefore, the answer for the first field should be "NA".

Next, assessing whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" which could be suspicious, but it also states that the finding was "diminishingly small" and "no definite conclusions could be drawn". Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, the answer here should be "no". Even though there's some abnormality, the lack of conclusive evidence points to "no" rather than "yes" or "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scores in the text, which aligns with the conclusion that there's no malignancy reported.

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's only one mentioned lesion, which is inconclusive. The JSON structure shouldn't have nested elements, so each field is a top-level key. Double-checking the allowed values and the text again to confirm there's no oversight. Everything seems to fit: sample type is NA, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.
