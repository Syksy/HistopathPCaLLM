Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and reported Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided statement, there's mention of "prostate sample material" being collected, but it doesn't specify the method. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't present. The phrase "routinely collected according to provided instructions" is vague. Without explicit mention, I should default to "NA" here.

Next, assessing malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" which could suggest something suspicious. However, it also states that the finding was "diminishingly small" and "no definite conclusions could be drawn". Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, the answer here should be "no". Even though there's some abnormality, the lack of conclusive evidence points to "no" rather than "NA" because the absence of a definite conclusion implies they didn't find enough to confirm malignancy.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers or "NA" if benign. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scores in the text, which reinforces using "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's only one mentioned. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each field to confirm accuracy. Sample type is "NA", malignancy is "no", Gleason is "NA". That seems correct based on the provided text.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
