Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat". That's Finnish for prostate biopsies. So the original sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions a focus in sample 1B where there's nuclear atypia and morphology that might correspond to adenocarcinoma. However, it's noted as being so scant that it remains suspicious, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. So, there's a suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis. The question is whether this counts as malignant. Since it's only a suspicion and not a clear finding, the answer here should be "ei" (no), because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. If it were confirmed, even if it's the worst lesion, it would be "kyllä", but here it's uncertain.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers, or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to #2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, without a confirmed adenocarcinoma, they wouldn't assign a Gleason score. Gleason is only for confirmed cases.

Putting it all together: sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion is considered. The answer here meets all criteria.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

Perustelut:
1. Näytteen tyypiksi todetaan selvästi "biopsy" (prostatabiopsiat).
2. Pahanlaatuisuudesta mainitaan epäily (suspisio), mutta selvää adenokarsinoomaa ei löydetty. Tulkitaan siis "ei".
3. Koska selvää adenokarsinoomaa ei raportoida, Gleason-luokkaa ei anneta (NA).
