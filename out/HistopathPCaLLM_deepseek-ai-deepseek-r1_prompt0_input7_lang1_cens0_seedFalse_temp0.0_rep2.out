Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat" which is Finnish for prostate biopsies. So the original type should be "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report mentions a focus in sample 1B with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's described as so scant that it's on the suspicion level, and no definite adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. Since it's only a suspicion and not a clear diagnosis, the malignancy presence would be "ei" (no). Even though there's a suspicion, the key here is that it's not confirmed, so the answer should be "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the Gleason score isn't provided. Therefore, this field should be "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with the specified keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Let me double-check each part. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. That all fits the criteria.

{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
