Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat". That's Finnish for prostate biopsies. So the original sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions a focus in sample 1B where there's some suspicion of adenocarcinoma, but it's described as so scant that it remains at a suspicion level and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. So the key here is that there's a suspicion but no definitive malignancy. Since the question is about whether malignant findings were present, and the answer here is that there's a suspicion but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" (no)? Wait, but the presence of "suspisio" might complicate things. However, the instructions say to report only the worst lesion. If the suspicion isn't confirmed, then technically, it's not a definitive malignancy. So "ei" would be correct. But I need to be careful here. The text says "suspisio-asteelle, eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" which translates to "suspicion level, and no clear adenocarcinoma was found." So the answer here is "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy detected.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to #2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, since it's not confirmed as malignant, we don't report a Gleason score. So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: ei
3. Gleason: NA

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are the three fields, each with their respective values. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm. The sample is definitely a biopsy. The malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei". No Gleason reported because no malignancy. Yes, that seems right.

{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "biopsy",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
