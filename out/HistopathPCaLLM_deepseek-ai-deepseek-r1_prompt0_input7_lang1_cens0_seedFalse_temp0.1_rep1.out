Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the report mentions "prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies. So the original sample type is a biopsy. That should be "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text describes a focus in sample 1B with some atypical nuclei and morphology that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so scant that it's only suspicious and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. Since it's suspicious but not definitive, the report doesn't confirm malignancy. So the presence of malignancy here would be "ei" (no), because it's not a clear diagnosis. Even though there's suspicion, the key point is that no definite adenocarcinoma is identified.

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA". Even if there were some suspicion, unless adenocarcinoma is confirmed, Gleason scoring isn't applied. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports using "NA".

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested structures. Each field is straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatabiopsiat" definitely refers to biopsies. The description of the findings as suspicious but not confirmed means malignancy isn't present. And no Gleason score is provided, so "NA" is appropriate there. All right, that should cover all three fields accurately.
