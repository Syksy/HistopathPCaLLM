Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The user wants three specific fields: the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since it's a biopsy, the first field should be "biopsy".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report says there's a focus with some atypical glands that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so scant that it's only suspicious, and no definite adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. So, the malignancy isn't confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's suspicious but not definitive, maybe "ei" (no) because they didn't find clear malignancy. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If it's only suspicious and not confirmed, should it be "ei"? Or maybe "NA"? The options are strict. The user instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states "eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found), the answer here is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (answer is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, otherwise "NA".

So putting it all together:
1. Sample type: biopsy
2. Malignant findings: ei
3. Gleason: NA

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The keys should be 1, 2, 3 with their respective values. Let me double-check the original text for any mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), but it's definitely biopsy. No Gleason mentioned. Malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei". Looks good.

```json
{
  "1": "biopsy",
  "2": "ei",
  "3": "NA"
}
