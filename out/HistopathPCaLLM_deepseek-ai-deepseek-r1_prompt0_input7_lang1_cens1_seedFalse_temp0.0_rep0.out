Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample was collected "rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti" which translates to routine instructions. However, the report doesn't mention specific terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the first field should be "NA".

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "kiinnietäviä löydöksiä" (interesting findings) with atypical structures and morphological changes. However, it's noted that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since the atypical findings were too small to confirm malignancy, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's uncertain, but not confirmed, maybe "ei" (no) is appropriate here. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the findings were suspicious but not definitive, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The report says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion could be made). So, it's unclear. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the presence isn't confirmed, maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the findings are present but not confirmed as malignant, perhaps "NA". Hmm. The user's instruction says for the second field: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the findings are atypical but not definitively malignant, then the answer would be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. The rest of the sample was normal. So, the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA". Since the presence of malignancy wasn't confirmed (second field is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text. The key points are the presence of atypical structures but too small to make a definitive conclusion. The rest is normal. So no malignancy is confirmed, hence "ei" for the second field. Yes, that makes sense. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. Gleason isn't applicable here, so NA.
