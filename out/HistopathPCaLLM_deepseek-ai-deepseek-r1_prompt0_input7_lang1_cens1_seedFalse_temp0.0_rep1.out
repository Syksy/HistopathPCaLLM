Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytemateriaalia" translates to prostate sample material. However, the report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, I think the answer here is "NA" because the type isn't mentioned explicitly.

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The text mentions "kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" which translates to an interesting finding with atypical structures and morphological changes. However, it also states that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made ("mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä"). The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since atypical doesn't necessarily mean malignant and the report is inconclusive, the malignancy presence isn't confirmed. So, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignant finding reported. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions atypical changes but can't confirm malignancy. Should it be "ei" (no malignancy) or "NA" (not available)? The question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since the report is inconclusive and doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. But if the presence is uncertain, perhaps "NA"? Hmm. The instructions say for the third field, if benign, Gleason is "NA". Here, since the conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis was made, but there's an atypical finding, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed. The question is whether the presence is "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions atypical changes, which could be suspicious but not definitive. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, maybe "NA" is appropriate. Wait, but the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report can't confirm, then technically, there's no malignant finding reported, so "ei". But I need to be careful. The text says "mitään definitiittiä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" – no definitive conclusion. So, the presence of malignancy is uncertain. But the allowed values don't include uncertain; it's either yes, no, or NA. In this case, since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's an atypical finding, maybe the answer is "ei" because the conclusion is that no definitive malignancy was found. So, "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant cases, else "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed (we answered "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA (not specified)
2. Malignant findings: ei (no)
3. Gleason: NA

Wait, but the user said "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). The text mentions "yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös" (in one sample, an interesting finding emerged). But the finding was too small to make a definitive conclusion. So, even if there's a suspicious lesion, it's not confirmed. Therefore, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".
