Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytemateriaalia" translates to prostate sample material. However, the report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't clearly stated here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says there's an "kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (interesting finding with atypical structures and morphological changes). However, it's noted as "häviävän pieni" (very small) and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since the atypical findings are present but not definitive, and the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's uncertain, but there's some atypical features, but not enough to confirm malignancy, maybe "ei" (no) because the final conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis was made. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the atypical findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? The options are strict: "kyllä" (yes) if malignant, "ei" (no) if benign, or "NA" if unknown. Since the report says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion), but mentions atypical changes. However, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. So, perhaps the answer is "ei" because the final assessment didn't confirm malignancy. Alternatively, if the atypical changes are considered as possible malignancy, but since it's not definitive, maybe "NA". But the options for question 2 are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that the rest of the material was typical. The main finding was too small to make a conclusion. So, the presence of malignant findings is not confirmed. Therefore, the answer would be "ei" (no), because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, even though there's an atypical finding that's inconclusive. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If there's an atypical finding that's suspicious but not definitive, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The answer should be "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. The presence of some atypical cells doesn't necessarily mean malignant unless confirmed. So, "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to question 2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.
