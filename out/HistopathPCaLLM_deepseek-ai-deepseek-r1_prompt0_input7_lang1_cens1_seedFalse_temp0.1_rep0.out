Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample was collected "rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti" which translates to routine instructions. The term "prostatanäytemateriaalia" means prostate sample material. However, the report doesn't specify the exact procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned, hence NA.

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (interesting finding with atypical structures and morphological changes). However, it's noted as "häviävän pieni" (very small) and no definitive conclusion was made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since the atypical findings were too small to confirm malignancy and the rest was normal, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So, the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to the second question is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports using NA.

Double-checking each part: sample type not specified, malignancy not definitively present, and no Gleason reported. All answers align with the given text and the allowed values.
