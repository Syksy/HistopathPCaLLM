Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." It mentions that a sufficient amount of prostate sample was collected routinely. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the first field should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (an interesting finding with atypical structures and morphological changes). However, it also states that the finding was so small that no definitive conclusion could be made, and the rest of the material showed typical structures. Since the atypical findings are noted but not confirmed as malignant, and the report doesn't definitively conclude malignancy, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So the answer here is "ei" (no), because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, even though there's an atypical finding. Wait, but "ei" means "no malignant findings". However, the presence of atypical structures might be considered suspicious. But the key here is that the report says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion could be made). So the malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer is "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. Alternatively, if the presence of atypical cells is considered as possible malignancy but not confirmed, maybe "ei" is correct because the final conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis was made. So the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
