Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "prostatanäytemateriaalia" (prostate sample) collected routinely. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here, which means I should put "NA" for the first field.

Next, assessing if there are malignant findings. The text mentions "kiinnostava löydös" (interesting finding) with atypical structures and morphological changes. However, it's noted as "häviävän pieni" (very small) and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since the atypical findings are present but not definitively malignant, and the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no clear malignancy reported. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion. Does that mean it's uncertain? But the question is whether malignant findings were present. If it's uncertain, maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, "NA" if the presence is unknown. But the options don't include uncertainty. The key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since the atypical findings are noted but not confirmed as malignant, and the rest is normal, the answer should be "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy reported.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is not confirmed (answer to 2 is "ei"), the Gleason grade should be "NA".

So putting it all together:
1. "NA" (sample type not specified)
2. "ei" (no malignant findings confirmed)
3. "NA" (no malignancy, so no Gleason)
