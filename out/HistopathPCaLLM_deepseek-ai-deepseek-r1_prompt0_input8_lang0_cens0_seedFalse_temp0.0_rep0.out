Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, Sample 3 is described as a "radical prostatectomy preparate." That clearly points to RP as the sample type. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is Sample 3, which is the prostatectomy. So the answer for the first field should be "RP."

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties..." Invasive properties typically indicate malignancy. Additionally, the lymph nodes are noted as free from malignant findings (0/6), but the main lesion in the prostate is malignant. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7." Even though it mentions the lower grade 3 is about 30%, the highest (most severe) is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7." The other details about lower grade percentages don't affect the highest reported grade, which is what's needed here.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion's data is used. The main tumor in Sample 3 is the most severe, so all answers are based on that. The JSON structure should not have nested elements, just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check the allowed values and the exact phrasing in the report to confirm accuracy. Everything seems to align. The final JSON should have "RP", "yes", and "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
