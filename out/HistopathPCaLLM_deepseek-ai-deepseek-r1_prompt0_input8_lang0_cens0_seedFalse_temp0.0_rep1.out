Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, Sample 3 is described as a "radical prostatectomy preparate." That clearly points to RP as the sample type. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is Sample 3, which is the prostatectomy. So the answer for the first field should be "RP."

Next, determining if there were malignant findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "tumor tissue... with invasive properties" in Sample 3. Invasive properties typically indicate malignancy. Additionally, the lymph nodes are noted as free from malignancy (0/6), but the main lesion in the prostate is malignant. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7." Even though it mentions the lower grade 3 is 30%, the highest (most severe) is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7" as per the highest reported. The other details about lower grade percentages don't affect the most severe lesion's grade.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion's data is used. The report talks about high-grade PIN changes and macrophages, but those aren't the primary malignancy. The key points are the presence of tumor in the prostatectomy sample, the Gleason 4+3=7, and the sample type being RP. The lymph nodes are negative, but the main sample is positive. So the structured JSON should reflect these three points accurately without any nested structures.
