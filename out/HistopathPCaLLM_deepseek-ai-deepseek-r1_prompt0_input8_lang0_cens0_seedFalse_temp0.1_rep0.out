Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are the original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, Sample 3 is described as a "radical prostatectomy preparate." So that should be RP. The other samples are lymph nodes and such, but the main sample in question is Sample 3, which is RP. So answer 1 is RP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties..." which clearly indicates malignancy. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion (Sample 3) is malignant. So answer 2 is yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7." Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So we take the highest one. So answer 3 is "4+3=7".

Need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since Sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the highest Gleason, that's the one to use. The other samples (lymph nodes) are benign, but the main sample is malignant. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Check allowed values again to confirm. All looks good. Now structure the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
