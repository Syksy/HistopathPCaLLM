Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, sample 3 is mentioned as a radical prostatectomy preparate. So that's RP. The other samples are lymph nodes and such, but the main sample type here is RP. So answer 1 is RP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says in sample 3 there's tumor tissue observed with invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion is in the prostate. Since the tumor is present there, the answer should be yes. So answer 2 is yes.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The highest identified here is 4+3=7. Even though there's mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So the Gleason grade should be "4+3=7". The instructions say to take the most severe lesion, which is this one. So answer 3 is 4+3=7.

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Check if any part is missing. The sample type is RP, malignant is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. All seems correct. No NA needed here since all info is present. The lymph nodes being negative don't affect the main tumor's malignancy status. So the final JSON should have those three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
