Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as indices 1, 2, and 3. Sample 3 is mentioned as containing the majority of the prostate tissue of interest and run according to the routine protocol. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, maybe the sample type isn't specified here, so I should put NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that samples 1 and 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings. But sample 3 has some interesting parts with immunological activity and suspicion of PIN changes. PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The report mentions that the highest Gleason patterns were missing, and there's a recording mishap. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy in sample 3, only suspicion, the answer here should be no. Even though there's a discussion about PIN, that's not malignant. So malignant findings are no.

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. However, the text states that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor. It mentions the lower grade covered over 10% but no grade score is reported due to a possible recording error. Since there's no actual Gleason score provided, even though there's a mention of lower grade, the answer should be NA. They didn't report the numbers, so we can't determine the sum.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3 has PIN but no malignancy, the most severe is from sample 3, which is still non-malignant. Therefore, the answers are all based on the highest severity, which in this case is no malignancy.
