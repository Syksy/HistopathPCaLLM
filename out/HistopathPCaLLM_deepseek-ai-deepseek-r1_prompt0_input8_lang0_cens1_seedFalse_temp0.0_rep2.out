Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, samples are referred to as "samples with indices 1, 2, 3". The third sample mentions "prostate tissue of interest" and "routine protocol". But the text doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the original sample type isn't specified here. So I should put NA for the first field.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says samples 1 and 2 are "completely free of malignant findings". Sample 3 has "some potentially interesting properties" but mentions "normal inflammation related changes are suspected". There's a mention of "suspicion of PIN-changes" which is prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a precursor but not malignant. Also, the highest Gleason patterns are missing, and there's a recording mishap. Since the only confirmed malignant findings are absent in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3 doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be no.

Third, Gleason grade. The text says the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor. It mentions the lower grade covered over 10% but no grade is reported due to a recording mishap. Since there's no actual Gleason score provided, even though there's a mention of lower grade, the structured answer should be NA. Because the presence of malignancy is no, Gleason isn't applicable here.

So putting it all together: original sample type NA, malignant findings no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and no nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion's results are considered. Since the samples 1 and 2 are benign and sample 3's findings are inconclusive, the most severe is no malignancy.
