Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, samples 1, 2, and 3 are mentioned. Sample 3 is described as containing the majority of the prostate tissue of interest and run according to the routine protocol. The other samples are non-primary. However, the report doesn't explicitly state if sample 3 is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the original sample type isn't specified here. So I'll put NA for that.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says samples 1 and 2 were confirmed free of malignant findings. But sample 3 mentions immunological activity and inflammation, but there's a suspicion of PIN changes (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is a precursor but not malignant. The highest Gleason patterns are missing, and there's a recording mishap mentioned. Since the malignant findings are explicitly ruled out in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3 doesn't confirm malignancy but discusses PIN changes (which are not malignant), the answer here should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the user wants major + minor = sum as numbers if malignant. Since the malignant finding is "no", the Gleason grade should be NA. Additionally, the text mentions that the highest Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor. Even though there's a mention of lower grade covering over 10%, no actual grade is reported. So even if there was a suspicion, without a confirmed malignant tumor, Gleason grade remains NA.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Check if all values are correctly mapped. Yes, looks good.
