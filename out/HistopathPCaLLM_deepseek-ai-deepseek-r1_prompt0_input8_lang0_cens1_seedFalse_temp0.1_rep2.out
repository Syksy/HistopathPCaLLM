Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "Sample 1, 2, 3" and mention "prostate tissue of interest" in Sample 3. The terms like "biopsy" or "RP" (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection) aren't explicitly mentioned. The text mentions "routine protocol" but that's vague. Since there's no clear indication, I think the answer here is NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, NA. The text says samples 1 and 2 are "completely free of malignant findings." Sample 3 has "some potentially interesting properties" but mentions "normal inflammation related changes" and "suspicion of PIN-changes." PIN is prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which is not malignant. The highest Gleason patterns are missing, and there's a recording mishap. Since the only confirmed malignant findings are absent in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3 doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be no.

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant. Since the malignant finding is no, the answer is NA. Even though there's mention of lower grade covering 10%, no actual grade is reported due to a mishap. So no valid Gleason score here.

So the structured JSON should have NA for sample type, no for malignancy, and NA for Gleason.
