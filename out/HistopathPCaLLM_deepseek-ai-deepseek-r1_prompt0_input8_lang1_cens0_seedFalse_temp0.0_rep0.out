Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin" translates to Sample 3 being a radical prostatectomy specimen. So the original type here is RP.

Next, check for malignant findings. The report mentions "molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which indicates the presence of tumor tissue invading structures. Also, "high grade PIN" is mentioned, but PIN is usually considered pre-malignant. However, the presence of invasive carcinoma means malignancy is present. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". The format required is "major+minor=sum", so 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 making up 30%, we only take the highest reported, which is 4+3=7.

Also, the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) don't have malignancy, but the main sample (näyte 3) does. So the malignancy answer is based on the main specimen, not the lymph nodes. 

Double-checking each field: sample type RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. All other details like inflammation or PIN don't affect the required fields. The JSON structure should be flat without nesting, and only the highest Gleason is considered.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
