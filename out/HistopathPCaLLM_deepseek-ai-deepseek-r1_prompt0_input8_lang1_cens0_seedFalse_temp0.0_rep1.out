Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text: "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin..." Radikaaliprostatektomia is Finnish for radical prostatectomy, so RP is the correct type here. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample in question is sample 3, which is RP.

Second, whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which translates to tumor tissue invading, indicating malignancy. Also, "ei kuitenkaan maligneja löydöksiä" in lymph nodes, but the main sample (3) has cancer. So the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, Gleason grade. The text states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade (3) being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So the value should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are taken, which in this case is the 4+3=7. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested, so straightforward key-value pairs in JSON. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
