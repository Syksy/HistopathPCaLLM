Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down the steps.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text: "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin." Radikaaliprostatektomia is radical prostatectomy, so RP. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is 3, which is RP. So the answer for the first field is "RP".

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which translates to tumor tissue invading, so malignant. Also, the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy: "ei maligneja löydöksiä (0/6)". But the main sample (3) has cancer. So the answer is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum. The text states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7". Since there's malignancy, we don't use NA here.

Wait, but the instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. The highest Gleason is 4+3=7, so that's correct. Even if there's a minor component, the main one is the highest. So the third field is "4+3=7".

Double-checking all points. Sample type is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. The JSON structure should have these without nested structures. Looks good.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "4+3=7"
}
```
