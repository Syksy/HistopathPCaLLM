Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin." Radikaaliprostatektomia translates to radical prostatectomy, so the sample type for this case is "RP". The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but since the third sample is the main one here and the others don't affect the required fields, the answer should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "näytteessä 3 havaitaan molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta" which indicates malignant tissue. Also, "Löydetty korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7" confirms malignancy. The lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy ("ei maligneja löydöksiä"), but the main sample (3) does. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the highest reported is 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 making up 30%, the instruction says to take the worst lesion's results. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7". The high-grade PIN mentioned is a precursor but doesn't affect the Gleason score here.

Double-checking the requirements: no nested structures, only the worst lesion, correct syntax. All values fit the allowed options. Looks good!
