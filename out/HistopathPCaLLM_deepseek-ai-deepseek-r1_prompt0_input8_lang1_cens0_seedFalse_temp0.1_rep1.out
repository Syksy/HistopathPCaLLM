Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down the steps.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin." Radikaaliprostatektomia is RP, so sample 3 is RP. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is 3. So the answer for the first field is "RP".

Next, check if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings) in sample 3: "kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which indicates malignancy. Also, the Gleason score is given. However, the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy: "ei maligneja löydöksiä (0/6)". But the main focus is on the worst lesion, which is in sample 3. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason grade. The text states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". The format required is "major+minor=sum". So it's 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade (3) being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. Each field is a simple value. Also, since the worst lesion is considered, sample 3's data is used. The other samples (1 and 2) don't affect the malignancy answer because sample 3 has cancer. The presence of high-grade PIN is not malignancy, so doesn't change the answer. The Gleason is only for malignant cases, which this is, so no NA there.

  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
