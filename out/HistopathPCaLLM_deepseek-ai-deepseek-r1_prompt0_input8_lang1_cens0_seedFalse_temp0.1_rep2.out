Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin." Radikaaliprostatetomia translates to radical prostatectomy, which corresponds to "RP" in the allowed values. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is sample 3, which is RP. So the first answer should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "näytteessä 3 havaitaan molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta" which means tumor tissue was found, indicating malignancy. Also, the Gleason score is provided, which is for malignant cases. Even though the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy ("ei maligneja"), the main sample (3) does. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the text says "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So that's the value to use. Since there's malignancy, we don't use "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have "RP", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion (highest Gleason) is reported. The other samples (1 and 2) are negative but sample 3 is positive, so that's the focus.

  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "RP",
  "pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "kyllä",
  "gleason_luokka": "4+3=7"
