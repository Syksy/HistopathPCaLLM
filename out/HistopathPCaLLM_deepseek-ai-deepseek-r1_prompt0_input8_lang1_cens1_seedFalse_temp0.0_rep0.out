Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions routine protocol. TURP is a common procedure for obtaining prostate samples, especially in cases of suspected cancer. Biopsy is also possible, but since there are multiple samples and the third is the largest part, maybe it's a TURP. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. The first two samples are "ei-primääristä solukkoa" (non-primary tissue), but sample 3 is the main one. Since it's not clear, maybe the original type is NA. Wait, but the user expects one of the allowed values. Let me check again. The text says "näyte 3 sisältää suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta, ja se ajetaan normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti." The term "rutiiniprotokolla" might refer to standard processing, but not the procedure type. Since there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, the safest answer here is NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), but immunologic activity and inflammatory changes are suspected. The highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a possible entry error. However, the text mentions "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (various growth patterns) and "kiinnostavin osuus" (most interesting part). But since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the Gleason is missing, maybe it's considered benign. However, the user's question is whether there were malignant findings. The samples 1 and 2 are free, sample 3's findings are uncertain. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspicious features. So the answer here would be "ei" (no), because the only confirmed samples (1 and 2) are free, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. Wait, but the user says to consider the worst lesion. The worst would be sample 3. However, the text says "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason grade missing) and "mahdollisesti kirjausvirhe" (possible entry error). There's mention of lower grade covering 10%, but no actual Gleason score. Since there's no confirmed malignancy in sample 3 (only suspicious but not confirmed), maybe the answer is "ei". But the user says to take the worst lesion. If sample 3 has some features but no confirmed malignancy, then maybe the answer is "kyllä" (yes) because there's a suspicion. Wait, but the samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain. The presence of malignancy is determined by confirmed malignant cells. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy in any sample, the answer should be "ei". The key line is "Numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita." Sample 3's findings are ambiguous but not confirmed as malignant. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the answer to the second question is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. However, the text mentions "major ja minor kohtiin" (major and minor components) with question marks, and a possible lower grade covering 10% but the value is missing. Even though there's a mention of Gleason components, since the actual grade isn't reported and the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. 

So the final structured data would be:
1. Original type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignancy: ei (no)
3. Gleason: NA
