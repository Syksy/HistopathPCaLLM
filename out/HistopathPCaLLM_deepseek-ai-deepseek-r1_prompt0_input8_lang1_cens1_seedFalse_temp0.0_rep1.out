Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and "ajetaan normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti" (processed according to routine protocol). Biopsy samples are usually taken with a needle, while RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are surgical procedures. The text doesn't specify surgery, so maybe it's a biopsy. But wait, the third sample is the largest part of the prostate tissue being examined. TURP samples are usually from resections, but the mention of routine protocol might not be enough. Since it's not clear, maybe the original type is "NA" here. However, the first two samples are labeled as "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies), but the third is the main one. The text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type, so perhaps "NA" is safest.

Second, malignancy presence. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The first two samples are free of malignancies ("maligniteeteista vapaita"). The third sample has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) and mentions "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (various growth patterns). However, the highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a suspicion of lower grade covering 10% but the value is missing. The immunologic activity is noted, but it's unclear if it's malignant. Since the first two samples are benign, but the third has some ambiguous findings. However, the key point is whether there are malignant findings. The report says samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. The text mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings) in the question. Since samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain (no clear malignancy), the overall answer might be "ei". But wait, the third sample's description is a bit unclear. The user wants the worst lesion's result. If sample 3 has possible features but no confirmed malignancy, then maybe the answer is "ei". However, the mention of "kiinnostavin osuus" (most interesting portion) and "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia" could be suspicious, but without confirmed malignancy. The report doesn't state malignancy in sample 3, so "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan... matalempi grade kattoi n. 10%... graden arvo puuttuu". So, the Gleason grade is missing due to a possible entry error. Since there's no confirmed malignancy (from part 2), the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, if part 2 is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". However, if part 2 were "kyllä", then even if the grade is missing, maybe it's "NA". But in this case, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is unclear, so "NA"; malignancy is "ei"; Gleason is "NA".
