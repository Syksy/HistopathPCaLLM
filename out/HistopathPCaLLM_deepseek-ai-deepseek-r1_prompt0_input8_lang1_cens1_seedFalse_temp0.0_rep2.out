Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and reported Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions routine protocol. TURP is a common procedure for obtaining prostate samples, especially in cases of suspected cancer. Biopsy is also possible, but since there are multiple samples and the third is the largest part, maybe it's a TURP. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. The first two samples are "ei-primääristä solukkoa" (non-primary tissue), but sample 3 is the main one. Since it's not clear, maybe the original type is NA. Wait, but the user might expect TURP here. Let me check again. The text says "näyte 3 sisältää suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta, ja se ajetaan normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti." "Ajetus" in Finnish can refer to processing, but TURP is a procedure. Without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to put NA.

Next, presence of malignancy. The first two samples (1 and 2) are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), but the highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a suspected lower grade covering 10%, but the actual grade is missing due to possible entry error. However, the text mentions "immunologinen aktiviteetti" and "tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia" (inflammatory changes). Since the first two samples are benign, and sample 3 has some suspicious features but no confirmed malignancy (since Gleason is missing), maybe the answer is "ei" (no). But wait, the third sample's findings are uncertain. The key is whether there are malignant findings. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. So overall, the answer is "ei".

For Gleason grade, the user wants "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. However, the text mentions "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan... matalempi grade kattoi n. 10%... graden arvo puuttuu". So even though there's a mention of possible lower grade, since it's not confirmed and malignancy is absent, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Original type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA
