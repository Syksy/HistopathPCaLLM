Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me parse the given text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions routine protocol. TURP is a common procedure for prostate samples, but the text doesn't explicitly state TURP or RP. However, since it's a routine protocol and multiple samples, maybe biopsy? Wait, but biopsies are usually multiple cores. The text says "näyte 3 sisältää suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta" which might suggest a larger sample, possibly TURP. But I'm not sure. The user might default to NA if unclear. But let me check again. The samples 1 and 2 are "ei-primääristä solukkoa" (non-primary tissue?), and sample 3 is the main part. Maybe it's a TURP since that's a procedure to remove prostate tissue, especially if part of it is being examined. Alternatively, if it's a biopsy, but the mention of "suurimman osan" (majority) might suggest a larger resection. Hmm. The text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type, so maybe NA is safer here. But I need to be careful. Let me note that the original sample type is unclear, so NA.

Second, presence of malignancy. The text says "numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita" (samples 1 and 2 are free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), but mentions "tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia epäillään" (suspected inflammatory changes). Also, "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason grade missing) and mentions a possible lower grade covering 10% but the grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error. There's suspicion of PIN changes, but PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is not malignancy. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3 has uncertain features but no confirmed malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the malignant findings are not confirmed. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are ambiguous. The Gleason grade is missing, so maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The text says "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan... major ja minor kohtiin; ... matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% ... graden arvo puuttuu". So they tried to note major and minor but it's missing, possibly a clerical error. Since there's no confirmed Gleason score (as the values are missing), and the samples with malignancy (if any) are not confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. However, the user instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" only for malignant cases, else NA. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: original type NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
