Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format with allowed values. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions "normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti" (normal routine protocol). But there's no clear mention of biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So maybe the type isn't specified here, so I should put "NA".

Second, whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) but mentions that the highest Gleason grade is missing, with a possible entry error. However, there's a mention of "matalempi grade kattoi n. 10%" (lower grade covered about 10%), but the actual grade value is missing. Since malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, and samples 1 and 2 are benign, but sample 3 has some ambiguous findings. Wait, the user wants the worst lesion's results. The third sample's findings are unclear. The report says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for samples 1 and 2, but sample 3's status is uncertain. The key point is whether any sample is malignant. Since the third sample's Gleason grade is missing due to possible error, but there's a lower grade covering 10%, but the actual malignancy isn't confirmed. The report doesn't clearly state malignancy, so maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because the samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's malignancy is uncertain. But wait, the user says to consider the worst lesion. If sample 3 has possible malignancy but it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "kyllä"? Wait, the text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for samples 1 and 2. For sample 3, there's mention of "immunologinen aktiviteetti" and "tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia" (inflammatory changes). The Gleason grade is missing, possibly a clerical error, but there's a lower grade covering 10%. However, since the highest Gleason is missing and the grade value is missing, maybe it's not confirmed as malignant. So the conclusion might be that there are no malignancies, so "ei".

Third, the Gleason score. If there are no malignancies, it's "NA". But if there's a malignancy, it should be "major+minor=sum". In this case, since the answer to question 2 is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But wait, the third sample mentions "major ja minor kohtiin" with question marks, and a lower grade covering 10%, but the actual grade is missing. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, even though there's a mention of Gleason components, but they are not properly recorded, so the answer remains "NA".

So putting it all together:

1. Original sample type: Not specified, so "NA".
2. Malignant findings: Samples 1 and 2 are free, sample 3's findings are ambiguous but not confirmed. So "ei".
3. Gleason score: "NA" because no malignancy confirmed.
