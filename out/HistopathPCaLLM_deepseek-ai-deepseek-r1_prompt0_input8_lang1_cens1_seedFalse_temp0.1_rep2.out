Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample mentions "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions "normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti" (normal routine protocol). RP usually stands for radical prostatectomy, but here it's part of routine protocol, not sure. TURP is transurethral resection. However, the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. The samples are labeled numerically, which is common in biopsies. But since it's not clear, maybe "NA" is safer here. Wait, the first samples (1 and 2) are "ei-primääristä solukkoa" (non-primary tissue?), and sample 3 is the main part. But the original type isn't specified, so I think the answer is "NA".

Second, malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), but mentions "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason grade missing) and "grade arvo puuttuu" (grade value missing). There's suspicion of PIN changes but no clear malignancy. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed, the overall answer might be "ei". Wait, but the third sample has "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (varying growth patterns) and immunologic activity. However, without confirmed malignancy, and the highest Gleason missing, maybe it's still considered non-malignant. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". If malignant, provide the sum; else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The text mentions "major ja minor kohtiin" (major and minor parts) but the values are missing ("merkattuna ? ja ?") and "grade arvo puuttuu". Even though there's a mention of lower grade covering 10%, the actual values aren't provided. So "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
