Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor findings, and the reported Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A total 20g of electrosection shavings were obtained as the sample material." Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed using an electrified loop. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states, "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia." That clearly indicates no malignancy, so the answer here is "no".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report says there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason scoring here, which makes sense because it's benign.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so the benign finding is the only one. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each part. Sample type: TURP. Malignant: no. Gleason: NA. That all fits. I think that's it.
