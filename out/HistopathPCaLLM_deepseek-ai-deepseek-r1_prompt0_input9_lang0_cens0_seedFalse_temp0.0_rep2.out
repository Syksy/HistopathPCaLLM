Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "electrosection shavings." I remember that TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which often involves electrosection. Biopsy is usually a needle sample, and RP is radical prostatectomy, which is surgery. So here, TURP seems right.

Next, malignant findings. The text explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed," so the answer should be "no."

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So that's straightforward.

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion's results. Since everything here is benign, there's no need to consider other lesions. All fields check out as "TURP", "no", and "NA".

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
