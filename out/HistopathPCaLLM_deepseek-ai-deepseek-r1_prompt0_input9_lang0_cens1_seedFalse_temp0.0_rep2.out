Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, there's mention of "sample material obtained" and "processed in batches." However, the report doesn't specify the exact procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just talks about processing steps. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't explicitly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says the epithelial cell lining appears normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to processing issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. There's no mention of malignancy, so the answer here should be "no" because if there's no evidence of malignancy, it's safer to say no rather than NA. Wait, but the user might consider that if the processing was faulty, maybe they couldn't determine. But the report says "appears rather normal," so maybe "no" is correct. Hmm, tricky. But since the conclusion is that they can't draw conclusions due to processing issues, maybe it's NA. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the examination couldn't confirm due to processing, but the observed parts are normal, maybe it's "no" because there's no indication of malignancy found. But the report says conclusions can't be made. So maybe NA? But the allowed values don't have an uncertain category. The question is whether there were malignant findings. If they didn't find any, even if inconclusive, maybe it's "no." But the report says "cannot be conclusively drawn," which might imply uncertainty. However, the presence of normal epithelial cells and no mention of tumor cells would lean towards "no." I think "no" is the right answer here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignant finding is "no" (as per previous conclusion), the Gleason grade should be NA. There's no mention of Gleason scores in the report, which supports this.

So putting it all together:
1. Original sample type: NA
2. Malignant tumor findings: no
3. Gleason grade: NA
