Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, there's mention of "sample material obtained" and "processed in batches." However, the report doesn't specify the exact procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't explicitly stated.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says the epithelial cells appear normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to processing issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. Since there's no mention of malignancy and the findings are inconclusive, the answer here should be NA. It's not confirming presence or absence due to processing problems.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the report doesn't indicate any malignancy and the findings are inconclusive, there's no Gleason grade provided. So this should be NA as well.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but since there's no mention of any lesions, just normal tissue and processing issues, all fields default to NA. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so it's straightforward.
