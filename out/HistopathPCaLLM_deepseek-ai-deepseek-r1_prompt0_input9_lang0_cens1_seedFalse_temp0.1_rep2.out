Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are original sample type, presence of malignant tumor, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, there's mention of "sample material obtained" and "processed in batches". However, the specific type like biopsy, RP, or TURP isn't explicitly stated. The report talks about processing steps and issues, but no indication of the sample's origin. So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't specified.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and mentions "glandular structures" being disproportionate due to technical issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. There's no mention of malignancy, so it's not confirmed. Since the report is inconclusive, the answer here should be NA. It's not a clear yes or no because the processing issues might have obscured results, but the report doesn't state malignancy.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignant finding is NA here, the Gleason grade should also be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades, which aligns with the inconclusive nature due to processing problems.

So putting it all together: sample type NA, malignant findings NA, Gleason grade NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm there's no mention of sample type or malignancy. Yep, nothing specific. Alright, that's the conclusion.
