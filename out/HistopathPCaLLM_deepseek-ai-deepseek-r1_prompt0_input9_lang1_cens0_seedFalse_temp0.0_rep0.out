Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "No malignancy is present". So the answer here is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So that's straightforward.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. In this case, since there's no malignancy, all fields should be filled accordingly without any issues. Let me double-check each part to ensure accuracy.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
