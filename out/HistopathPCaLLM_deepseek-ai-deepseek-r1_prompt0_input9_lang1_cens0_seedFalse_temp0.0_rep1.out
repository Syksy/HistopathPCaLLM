Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, identifying the sample type. The report mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I know that "elektrosektio" refers to a type of surgical procedure, often abbreviated as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "no malignancy is found". So the presence of malignant findings should be "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason-luokka would be NA.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The answer seems straightforward here as there's no mention of any Gleason scoring, and malignancy is absent. All three fields should be correctly filled based on the provided text.

```json
{
  "alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "pahanlaatuiset_löydökset": "ei",
  "gleason_luokka": "NA"
}
```
