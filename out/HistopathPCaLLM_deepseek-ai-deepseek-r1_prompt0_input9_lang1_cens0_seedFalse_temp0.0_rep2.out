Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "no malignancy is found". So the presence of malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So the Gleason field is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Each field is straightforward here. Let me double-check the allowed values. Sample type allows "TURP", malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA". All correct. No other details in the text contradict this. The mention of hyperplasia aligns with benign findings. Everything seems in order.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen_alkuperäinen_tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia_löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
