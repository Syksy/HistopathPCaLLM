Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja," which translates to prostate electroresection chips. TURP is a type of electroresection, so the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin," meaning no malignancy was found. So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because it's benign, so no need to look further there.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results. All the required fields are addressed, and the values fit the allowed options. Let me double-check the translations and terms to ensure accuracy. Everything seems to align. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. That's all.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
