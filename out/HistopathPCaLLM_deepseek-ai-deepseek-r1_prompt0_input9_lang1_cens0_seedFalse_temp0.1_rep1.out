Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The report is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the task is to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "No malignancy is present". So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For the Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were some mention, since it's benign, Gleason isn't applicable.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested objects. Each key is straightforward. Let me double-check the terms to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is absent, so Gleason is NA. All seems to fit.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
