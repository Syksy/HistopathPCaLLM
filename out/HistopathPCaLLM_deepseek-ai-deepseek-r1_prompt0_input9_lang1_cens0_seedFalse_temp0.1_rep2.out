Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". Elektrosektio translates to electrosection, which is a type of TURP procedure. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which means no malignancy was found. So the presence of malignant findings is "ei".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy here, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only include the worst lesion's results. The answer seems straightforward here because there's no malignancy mentioned. All three fields should be filled correctly based on the given text.

```json
{
  "1. Näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "TURP",
  "2. Pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
```
