Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) obtained, processed in steps, and some discarded. There's no mention of a specific procedure like a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The text talks about technical difficulties in handling the sample, but doesn't specify the procedure type. So, the original type isn't clear here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, whether there were malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue) with some structures appearing disproportionately large, possibly due to technical issues. It also states that conclusions can't be drawn confidently and suspects faulty sample handling. There's no mention of cancer cells, malignancy, or neoplasia. Since the sample is inconclusive and no malignancy is explicitly found, but also not definitively ruled out, the safest answer here is "ei" (no), because if there's no evidence of malignancy, it's considered negative. However, the text says they can't draw conclusions, which might make me think "NA". But according to the instructions, if there's no mention of malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, but no malignancy is found, then "ei". If the presence can't be determined, maybe "NA". The text says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions can't be drawn with certainty), but they don't report any malignant findings. So, since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer is "ei".

Third, the Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, else "NA". Since the second answer is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type is NA, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA.
