Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" which translates to sample material. The procedure involved taking a few dozen grams, part of which was processed and part discarded. The methods mention "ajot tehtiin 8:ssa stepissä" which might refer to sections or steps in processing. There's no mention of specific procedures like a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since the text doesn't specify the sample type, I should go with NA here.

Next, determining if there's malignancy. The report states that there are large amounts of prostate tissue ("prostatasolukkoa") and the epithelial border appears normal. Some gland structures are disproportionately sized, possibly due to technical issues in handling. The conclusion mentions that no definitive conclusions can be drawn and suspects faulty sample processing. Since there's no mention of cancer cells, neoplasia, or malignancy indicators, the presence of malignancy should be "ei" (no). However, the uncertainty in the report might make this tricky. But the key point is that they didn't find malignant features, just technical issues. So "ei" seems correct.

For Gleason grade, the format is major+minor=sum. But since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some abnormalities, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so definitely NA here.

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion is considered, which in this case there's none.

```json
{
  "1. näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi": "NA",
  "2. pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä": "ei",
  "3. Gleason-luokka": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. Näytteen tyyppiä ei raportissa mainita suoraan (ei viittauksia biopsy, RP tai TURP-proseduureihin).
2. Raportissa ei mainita karsinoomaa, solujen maligniteettia tai muita pahanlaatuisuuden merkkejä. Epäily keskittyy teknisiin ongelmiin/näytteenkäsittelyyn.
3. Koska pahanlaatuisuutta ei havaittu, Gleason-luokkaa ei aseteta (hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille sallittu arvo "NA").
