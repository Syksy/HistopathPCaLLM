Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "näytemateriaalia saatiin" which translates to sample material obtained. But there's no clear indication of the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The text talks about processing the sample in steps and some being discarded, but it doesn't specify the original procedure. So I think the answer here is "NA" because the type isn't mentioned.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue) and mentions the epithelial border seems normal. Some glands are disproportionately sized, possibly due to technical issues. Importantly, it says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions can't be drawn with certainty) and suspects faulty sample handling. There's no mention of cancer cells, malignancy, or neoplasia. Since no definitive malignant findings are reported, the answer should be "ei" (no), but wait—the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the sample is inconclusive due to handling issues, does that mean we can't confirm malignancy? The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and attributes abnormalities to technical issues, maybe "ei" is correct. But if the sample is inadequate, maybe "NA"? Hmm. The key is whether malignant findings were present. The text doesn't report any, so "ei" seems right.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, else "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type NA, malignancy ei, Gleason NA. Let me double-check. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. No malignancy detected, so "ei". Therefore, Gleason is NA. That makes sense.
