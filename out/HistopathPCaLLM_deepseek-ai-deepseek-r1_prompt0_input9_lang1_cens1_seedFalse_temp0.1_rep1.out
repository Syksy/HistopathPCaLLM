Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: original sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let's break down each part.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) obtained, processed in steps, and some discarded. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The procedure described seems like a biopsy process, but it's not explicitly stated. However, since the text talks about handling the sample in steps and parts being discarded, maybe it's a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if there's no clear indication, the answer should be "NA".

Next, presence of malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue), "epiteelisolukon raja normaalilta" (epithelial tissue border appears normal), and some structures seem disproportionately large possibly due to technical issues. There's no mention of cancer, malignancy, or any Gleason patterns. The conclusion states that no definite conclusions can be drawn and suspects faulty sample handling. So, there's no indication of malignancy found, but the report is inconclusive. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and attributes abnormalities to possible technical issues, the answer here might be "ei" (no), but since it's inconclusive, maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any malignancy, even if inconclusive, maybe the answer is "ei". But if the inconclusive result means it's uncertain, perhaps "NA". Hmm. The user specified that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" as integers or "NA" if benign. Since the presence of malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: sample type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA". Malignancy: "ei". Gleason: "NA".
