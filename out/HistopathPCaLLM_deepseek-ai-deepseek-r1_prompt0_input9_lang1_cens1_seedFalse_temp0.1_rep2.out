Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin..." which translates to getting a few dozen grams of sample material. Then it mentions that part was processed and part was discarded. The terms here don't clearly indicate if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Biopsies are usually smaller, while RP and TURP are surgical procedures. Since the text doesn't specify the procedure type and just mentions sample material being handled, I might have to go with "NA" here.

Next, presence of malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa havaittiin, ja epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta." So, large amounts of prostate tissue with normal epithelial borders. Some gland structures are disproportionately sized, possibly due to technical issues. The conclusion mentions that definitive conclusions can't be drawn and suspects faulty sample handling. There's no mention of cancer cells, atypia, or malignancy. So, since no malignant findings are reported, but it's uncertain due to handling issues, should it be "ei" or "NA"? The instructions say if there are no malignant findings, use "ei". But the uncertainty might complicate things. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since the text doesn't indicate any, even with uncertainty, the answer would be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. But in this case, there's no malignancy detected, so Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text again. The report mentions no clear signs of malignancy, just some structural issues possibly due to technical problems. So no malignancy, hence Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:
1. Sample type: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
2. Malignancy: ei
3. Gleason: NA
