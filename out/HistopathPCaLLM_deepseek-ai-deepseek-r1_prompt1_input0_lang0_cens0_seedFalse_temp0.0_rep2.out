Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. The example given used "biopsy" when the text mentioned biopsy. Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So Malignancy is definitely "no".

For Gleason grade, since the report is benign and there's no mention of any carcinoma or malignant tumor, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but here there's no malignancy, so that's straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
