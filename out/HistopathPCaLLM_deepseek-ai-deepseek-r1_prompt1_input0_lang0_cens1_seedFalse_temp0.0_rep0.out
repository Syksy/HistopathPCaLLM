Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they couldn't determine if there's malignancy. The user instructions say to return "NA" if it's not possible to conclude. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed, and there's no mention of Gleason scores in the text, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as NA, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion reported. So the final answer should reflect all NAs where information isn't available or conclusive.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
