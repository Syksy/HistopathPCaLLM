Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they can't confirm malignancy. However, the user instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. Since there's no mention of malignancy being present, and they can't conclude it, the answer here should be "no" or "NA"? Wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. The text says they can't make an inference, so maybe NA is appropriate here. But the user might consider that if malignancy isn't found, it's "no." But the statement says they can't conduct the inference, so it's uncertain. So maybe "no" isn't correct. The correct answer here is "no" only if malignancy is explicitly ruled out. Since the text says they can't determine it, perhaps Malignancy should be NA. Wait, the example given in the instructions: in the example, the statement clearly mentions adenocarcinoma, so malignancy is yes. Here, since they can't infer, maybe the answer is "no" or "NA"? Let me check the exact wording. The statement says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they can't assess it. Therefore, the answer should be NA because it's not possible to determine. So Malignancy: NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed values are in the format major+minor=sum or NA if benign. Since malignancy is NA, and there's no mention of Gleason grading here, the Gleason field should be NA. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it can't be determined, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported and no scores mentioned.
