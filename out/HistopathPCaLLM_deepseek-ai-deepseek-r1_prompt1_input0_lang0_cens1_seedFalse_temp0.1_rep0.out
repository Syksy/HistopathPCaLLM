Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think Sampletype should be NA here because there's no explicit mention.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they couldn't determine malignancy. The user instructions say to use NA if the information isn't available. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed, and there's no mention of Gleason scores, Gleason should definitely be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because they can't conclude, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported. Need to make sure the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the exact allowed values. Let me double-check the example given. The example uses "biopsy", "yes", and "4+3=7". In this case, all three fields are NA, but wait, Sampletype: the text mentions "prostate tissue" but not the sample type. So unless the sample type can be inferred from context, but the example uses "biopsy" when it's mentioned. Here, there's no such mention. So NA is correct. Yes, that's right.
