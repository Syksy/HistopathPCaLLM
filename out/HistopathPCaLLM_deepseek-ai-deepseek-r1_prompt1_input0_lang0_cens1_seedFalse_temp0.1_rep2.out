Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't explicitly stated.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they couldn't determine if there's malignancy. The user instructions say to use NA if the information isn't available. Since the report states that malignancy can't be inferred, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy couldn't be determined, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. Also, the user mentioned to only consider the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions, so all fields remain NA.
