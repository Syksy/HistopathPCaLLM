Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical in a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This means benign prostate tissue without malignancy or carcinoma. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since the report mentions no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, with quotes and commas properly placed. No nested structures, just the three key-value pairs.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
