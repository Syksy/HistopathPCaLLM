Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Höyläyslastuja", which translates to "chips" or "shavings". In medical terms, TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically yields such chips. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not described as chips. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate, which isn't the case here. So the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta" (benign prostate tissue) and explicitly mentions no malignancy or carcinoma. So the malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign finding.

I need to ensure the JSON structure is correct, with the specified keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "ei" is correct for malignancy, and TURP is the right sample type here. Gleason is definitely NA in this case.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
