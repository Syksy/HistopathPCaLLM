Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings", which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy" which means no atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma is seen. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because it's benign.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, which in this case is benign, so no Gleason applies.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
