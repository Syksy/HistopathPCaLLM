Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings," which is typical in a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This clearly indicates no malignancy. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign finding.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, with commas and quotes properly placed. Also, confirm that there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, which in this case is benign, so no Gleason applies.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
