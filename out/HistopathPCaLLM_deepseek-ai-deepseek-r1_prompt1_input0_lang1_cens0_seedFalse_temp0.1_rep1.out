Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g..." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to shavings or chips, which is typical for a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This translates to benign prostate tissue without atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. But in this case, there's no malignancy, so all fields should be straightforward. Double-checking the terms to confirm sample type and absence of malignancy. Yep, TURP and "ei" for malignancy. Gleason remains NA. That should cover it.
