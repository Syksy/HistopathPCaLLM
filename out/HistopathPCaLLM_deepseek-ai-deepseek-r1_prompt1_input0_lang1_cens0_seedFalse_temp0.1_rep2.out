Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathology report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states: "Histologisessa tarkastelussa havaitaan hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." The key words here are "hyvänlaatuista" (benign), "ei malignia" (no malignancy), and "ei karsinoomaa" (no carcinoma). So the malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, with quotes and commas properly placed. Also, confirm that there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, which in this case is benign, so no Gleason applies.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
