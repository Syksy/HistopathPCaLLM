Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." The term "näytemateriaalia" translates to sample material, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't specify the sample type, so I think Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states: "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to "conclusions about cellular atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be made." Since they can't determine malignancy, it's not confirmed as yes or no. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they can't make a conclusion, maybe "ei" (no) isn't right. But the options are strict. Wait, the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If malignancy isn't found, but they can't conclude, maybe it's safer to put "ei" if there's no mention of malignancy. But the text says they can't make a determination. Hmm. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report explicitly states that malignancy can't be concluded, maybe "NA" is appropriate here. But the user might consider "ei" if there's no evidence. Wait, the text says "ei voida tehdä" (cannot be made), so it's uncertain. Therefore, Malignancy should be "NA".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "NA" here, but let's check the text again. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or specific grades. So Gleason should definitely be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because they can't determine it. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it. The example given in the problem had a biopsy sample with malignancy yes and a Gleason score. Here, none of those are present. So the JSON should reflect all NAs where applicable.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
