Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." The key term here is "näytemateriaalia," which translates to sample material. However, the report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no clear indication, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text states, "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to that they cannot conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Additionally, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan" means they can't determine if it's benign hyperplasia. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the answer here is "ei" (no), but wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". However, the report says they can't make a conclusion about malignancy. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they can't determine it, maybe "ei" is correct because there's no positive identification. Alternatively, if the presence is uncertain, maybe "NA". Hmm. The instructions say "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – "Were there malignant findings in the sample?" If they can't conclude, then it's not confirmed, so the answer should be "ei" because there's no definite malignancy found. Or is it "NA"? Let me check the example. In the example, when adenocarcinoma was found, it was "kyllä". Here, since they can't determine malignancy, maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed. But the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – if the report says they can't make a conclusion, does that mean there's no malignancy found, hence "ei"? Or is it that the presence is uncertain, so "NA"? The example uses "kyllä" when malignancy is present. If the report says they can't determine, then it's not confirmed, so "ei" might be appropriate. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the information isn't available. But the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report explicitly states that they can't make a conclusion about malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct because there's no positive finding. But I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think again. The question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report says they can't determine, then it's not confirmed, so the answer would be "ei" (no malignant findings). But maybe the answer should be "NA" if the information is not available. However, the user's instructions might consider "ei" as the correct answer when malignancy isn't found. Let's go with "ei" here.

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of Gleason scores or any carcinoma, and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA.
