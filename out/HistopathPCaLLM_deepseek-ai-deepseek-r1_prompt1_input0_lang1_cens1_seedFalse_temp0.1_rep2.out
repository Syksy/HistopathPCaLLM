Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." The key word here is "näytemateriaalia," which translates to sample material. However, the report doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no clear indication, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states, "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to not being able to conclude malignancy or carcinoma. Additionally, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä..." means they can't determine if it's benign hyperplasia. Since there's no evidence of malignancy but also uncertainty, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm any malignant findings.

Lastly, the Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions.

So, putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report.
