Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the statement mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." and refers to "prostate tissue material." However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The samples could be biopsies, but it's not clearly stated. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" but concludes with a suspicion of staining failure. There's no definitive mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor findings. The conclusion is about the staining panel possibly failing, not confirming malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no" or NA? Wait, the user instructions say if there's no malignant findings, it's "no". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and only mentions suspicion, but no actual tumor, Malignancy would be "no".

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "no" as there's no confirmed tumor, and Gleason is NA because it's benign.
