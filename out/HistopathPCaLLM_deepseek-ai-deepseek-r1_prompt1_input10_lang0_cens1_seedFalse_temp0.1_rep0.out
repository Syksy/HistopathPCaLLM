Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text medical report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." and refers to "prostate tissue material." The term "samples" is used, but the specific type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about immunological stainings and experimental panels, which are lab processes, but the original sample type isn't specified. So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells" and "suspicious formations" but concludes with "Suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing in some of the samples." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or confirmed malignancy. The suspicious findings are related to staining issues, not confirmed tumors. So Malignancy should be "no" because there's no definitive malignant tumor reported, just suspicion related to staining.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since Malignancy is "no," Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with the conclusion that there's no confirmed malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is no as there's no confirmed tumor, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
