Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. The allowed values are "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." Since it's a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, determining malignancy. The report states that there's "suspicio-löydös" (suspicious finding) but the diagnosis is uncertain, leaning towards benign ("benigniin päin"). The immunostaining results mention that the suspected focus is very small, and a definitive cancer diagnosis can't be made. So, even though there's suspicion, it's not confirmed as malignant. The allowed values are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since it's not confirmed and leans benign, Malignancy should be "ei."

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. The findings are inconclusive for cancer, so there's no Gleason provided. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. Hence, Gleason is "NA."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy confirmed, Gleason remains NA. Double-checking the Finnish terms to ensure accuracy. The conclusion is benign, so malignancy is "ei," sample type is biopsy, and Gleason NA.
