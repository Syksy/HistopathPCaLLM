Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" which means the suspected focus is very small and a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made. The conclusion is "Suspicio-löydös... diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin" – suspicious finding but diagnosis uncertain, leaning towards benign. So malignancy isn't confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy. But wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – malignant findings. If it's uncertain, does that count as "ei" or NA? The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when cancer is found. Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, perhaps "ei" because there's no definite malignancy. Or maybe NA? Hmm. The conclusion says "benigniin päin" which leans towards benign. So maybe "ei" is correct here. I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades. The example uses NA when there's no malignancy, so since malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't have any 4+3=7 type mentions, so that's confirmed.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The sample is biopsies, malignancy is not confirmed (leaning benign), so no Gleason. Yep, that seems right.
