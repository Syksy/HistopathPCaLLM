Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The report states "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" and "benigniin päin." This means there's suspicion but no definitive cancer diagnosis. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it's not confirmed malignant but suspicious, but the conclusion leans towards benign, maybe "ei" is appropriate here. However, the Suspicio-löydös (suspicious finding) complicates things. But the instructions say to report only the worst lesion. Since no malignancy is confirmed, and the final conclusion is benign, "ei" makes sense.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst findings are included.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
