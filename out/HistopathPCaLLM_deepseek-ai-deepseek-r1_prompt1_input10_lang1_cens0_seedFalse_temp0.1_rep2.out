Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. The allowed values are "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." Since it's a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, determining malignancy. The report states that there's a suspicion ("Suspicio-löydös") but the diagnosis is uncertain and leans towards benign ("benigniin päin"). The allowed values are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since there's no definitive malignancy and it's considered benign, Malignancy should be "ei."

Lastly, the Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. The immunostaining results are discussed, but there's no specific mention of Gleason 4+3 or similar. Since the malignancy is "ei," the Gleason field should be "NA."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no confirmed malignancy. The JSON structure should follow the example, using the specified keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check each part to make sure I didn't miss any details. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignancy is negative because the diagnosis is uncertain but benign. Gleason isn't applicable here. All looks good.
