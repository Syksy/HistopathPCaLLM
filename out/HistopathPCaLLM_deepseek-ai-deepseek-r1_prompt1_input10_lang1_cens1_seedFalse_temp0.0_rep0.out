Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. The text talks about samples arriving in batches due to a logistics error, but the original sample type isn't specified. So I think the sample type here is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text states "alustavassa tutkinnassa normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means "in the preliminary examination, normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material." This suggests no malignancy was found. However, there's mention of "kokeellisessa immunologisten värjäysten paneeleissa kahdessa viimeisestä näytteessä tuli esiin selviä patterneja" – experimental immunological staining panels showed clear patterns in the last two samples. But the conclusion is about suspicion of staining failure, not malignancy. The main finding here is normal basal tissue, so malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignancy (just normal tissue and staining issues), the Gleason score would be NA. The report doesn't discuss cancer grades, so this field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because the preliminary exam found normal tissue. Gleason is NA because there's no cancer reported.
