Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." The key term here is "prostatanäytteet" which translates to prostate samples. The text mentions that the samples arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample type isn't specified here, so I think the correct answer here is NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "alustavassa tutkinnassa normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa." Basal cells are normal in prostate tissue, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The other parts talk about immunohistochemical stains and possible technical issues, but no malignancy is reported. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as ei, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, all fields except Sampletype and Malignancy default to NA. Let me double-check the text again to confirm there's no mention of any malignant findings or sample types. Yep, looks correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
