Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. The text talks about samples arriving in batches due to a logistics error, but the original sample type isn't specified. So I think the sample type here is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "alustavassa tutkinnassa normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa." That means "in the preliminary examination, normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material." Normal tissue suggests no malignancy. However, there's mention of "kokeellisessa immunologisten värjäysten paneeleissa kahdessa viimeisestä näytteessä tuli esiin selviä patterneja" which refers to experimental immunological staining panels showing clear patterns in the last two samples. But the conclusion is about suspicion of staining failure in some samples, not about malignancy. The main finding here is normal basal tissue, so malignancy should be "ei" (no). The immunostaining issues don't indicate malignancy but rather technical problems.

Third, Gleason grade. The Gleason score is only reported if there's malignancy. Since the preliminary exam found normal tissue and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer cells, the malignancy is "ei", so Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with no malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because normal tissue was found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported.
