Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet" which translates to "Requested prostate samples". The text doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the sample type isn't clear from the information given. Therefore, I should mark this as "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa", which means normal basal tissue was found in the prostate tissue material. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The other parts talk about immunological staining panels and possible staining failures, but no malignancy is reported. So the malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "NA", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all fields except Sampletype and Malignancy default to NA where applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
