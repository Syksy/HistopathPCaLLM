Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." The key term here is "prostatanäytteet," which translates to prostate samples. The text mentions they arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample type isn't specified here, so the answer should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa." Basal cells being normal suggests no malignancy. There's mention of some patterns in the last two samples related to an experimental panel, but that's about the panel's reliability, not malignancy. The conclusion doesn't indicate any cancer findings. So Malignancy should be "ei."

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. But since the malignancy is "ei," the Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading. The focus is on the immunohistochemical stains and panel reliability, not cancer grading.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer was found. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report.
