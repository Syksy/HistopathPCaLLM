Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a histopathological report on prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." The key term here is "prostatanäytteet" which translates to prostate samples. However, the text doesn't specify the type of sample like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). It just mentions they arrived in eight separate batches due to a logistics error. Since there's no explicit mention of the sample type, I should mark this as NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "alustavassa tutkinnassa normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa." Basal cell tissue is normal, so no malignancy detected here. The other parts talk about immunological stains and patterns, but no mention of cancer. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. But since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer found, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion, which in this case is none. The answer should follow the example given, using the specified keys and values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
