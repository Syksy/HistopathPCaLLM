Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and later mentions a "malignant focus." Both of these clearly indicate malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report says "Gleason grading 4+3." The sum here would be 7, so the Gleason field should be "4+3=7." Even though there's a mention of high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), that's a separate finding and not part of the Gleason score for the main tumor. The instructions specify to take the most severe lesion, which in this case is the 4+3=7.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is correctly formatted. No other values in the text contradict these, like the basis and margins being free, but the main lesion is the one reported. So the final JSON should be as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
