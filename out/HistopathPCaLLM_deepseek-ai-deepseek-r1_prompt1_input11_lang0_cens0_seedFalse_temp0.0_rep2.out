Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and later mentions a "malignant focus." Both of these clearly indicate malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report says "Gleason grading 4+3." So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The correct format here would be "4+3=7." The other parts of the report mention high-grade PIN and other areas being free, but since we need the most severe lesion, the 4+3=7 is the key part here.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided doesn't nest anything, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. Everything seems to fit here. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. No conflicting information in the text that would suggest a different grade or sample type. The most severe lesion is the 4+3=7 mentioned, so that's the one to report.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
