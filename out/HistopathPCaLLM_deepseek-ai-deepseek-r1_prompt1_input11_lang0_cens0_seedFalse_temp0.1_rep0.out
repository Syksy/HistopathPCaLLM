Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and mentions a "malignant focus." Both terms indicate the presence of malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report says "Gleason grading 4+3." So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7." Even though the sum isn't explicitly written out, adding 4 and 3 gives 7, so following the example's format, it's safe to present it as "4+3=7."

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) around the tumor, but that's a separate finding and not the primary malignancy. The main focus here is the invasive tumor with Gleason 4+3, which is the most severe part.

No nested structures in the JSON, so just a flat structure with the three keys. Double-checking the allowed values and the example to make sure the formatting matches. Everything seems to align correctly.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
