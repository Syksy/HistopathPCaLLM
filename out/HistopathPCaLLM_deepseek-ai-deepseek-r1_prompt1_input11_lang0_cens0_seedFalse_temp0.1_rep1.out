Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they want. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I have to make sure each field adheres to those.

Starting with the first field: Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate". I know that "prostatectomy" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP), so the sample type here should be "RP". The example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions biopsy, so this seems straightforward.

Next, the Malignancy field. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text states "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus". Both terms indicate the presence of malignancy. The example also used "yes" when adenocarcinoma was mentioned. So here, Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text explicitly says "Gleason grading 4+3". The example used "4+3=7", so I need to follow that structure. Even though the sum isn't written out in the text, adding 4 and 3 gives 7, so it should be "4+3=7". The instructions mention that for malignant cases, it's preferable to have the major and minor grades with the sum. Since this is a malignant case, we include the Gleason score.

Now, checking if there's a more severe lesion mentioned. The text talks about the "max size 3 cm" and "covers approx 15%", but the most severe would be the Gleason 4+3. The other findings like high-grade PIN are around the tumor but not more severe. The example also took the highest Gleason from the most severe lesion. So we stick with 4+3=7.

Sampletype: RP (from prostatectomy)
Malignancy: yes (tumor and malignant focus mentioned)
Gleason: 4+3=7 (explicitly stated)

No nested structures needed, just the three top-level fields. Let me make sure there's no mention of other sample types like TURP or biopsy here. The term "prostatectomy" solidifies it as RP. All right, that should cover it.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
