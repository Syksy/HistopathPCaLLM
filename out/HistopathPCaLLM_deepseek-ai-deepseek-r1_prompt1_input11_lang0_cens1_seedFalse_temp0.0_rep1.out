Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prostate biopsy" in the example, but in the current case, the statement says "Prepared sampleset was run..." and later refers to "Microscopically prostate tissue is observed." There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I need to check if any of these terms are present. The example had "biopsy" in the text, but here, the sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The example had "Adenocarcinoma detected," which is a malignancy. In the current text, they mention "high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive." High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a precancerous condition, not malignant. The report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or tumor findings. The tissue appears to be forming tubular structures, but there's no indication of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no" or maybe NA? Wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. Since there's no mention of malignancy, but the evaluation is inconclusive for PIN, which isn't cancer. So Malignancy is "no" because there's no evidence of malignant tumor found. The example had "yes" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, since no malignancy is found, it's "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason should be NA. However, the text mentions "Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed..." Even though they mention scores 4 and 3, the assessment is unreliable and only 5% of the material was investigated. Since the tumor isn't malignant (Malignancy is "no"), Gleason should be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason scores, if the malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. So in this case, since malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. The example used quotes around the values, so follow that. Check if the original sample type is mentioned. The text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP, so Sampletype is NA. Correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
