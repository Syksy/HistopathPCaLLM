Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the structure shouldn't be nested. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for a biopsy was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" refers to a prostatectomy, which is usually radical prostatectomy, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, there's "invasiivista kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue), which clearly indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". So the major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The correct format would be "4+3=7". Since there's a malignant finding, we don't use NA here.

I also need to check if there are other lesions mentioned, but the instruction says to take only the worst. The report mentions a malignant focus in apex and central part, covering 15% of the area. The Gleason 4+3=7 is the key part here. Other findings like high-grade PIN and clean margins don't affect the worst lesion's grading.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. Let me double-check the original text to ensure I didn't miss anything. The sample is a prostatectomy specimen, malignancy is present, and Gleason score is explicitly stated. All seems correct.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
