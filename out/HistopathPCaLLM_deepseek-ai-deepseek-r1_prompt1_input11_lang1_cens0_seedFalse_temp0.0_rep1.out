Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti..." which translates to prostatectomy specimen. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be RP. That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus, and "invasioivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So clearly malignant. The answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". So the major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The correct format is "4+3=7". The other parts about high-grade PIN or benign findings in the base or seminal vesicles don't affect the Gleason score here since we only take the worst lesion's result. Also, the presence of malignancy means we don't put NA here.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. All three fields are top-level. The example given in the problem shows exactly that structure. No issues there.

Double-checking the sample type: prostatektomiapreparaatti is indeed RP. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is clearly stated as 4+3. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

No other information in the text contradicts this. The mention of margins being clear or other findings like high-grade PIN don't affect the required fields. The key points are all addressed.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
