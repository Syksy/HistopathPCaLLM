Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first part mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". The term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is a surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here.

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus. Also, there's mention of "invasioivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4 is the major, 3 is the minor, summing to 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example given doesn't include any, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions a malignant focus with Gleason 4+3, and no other worse findings, so that's the one to use.

Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" definitely refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP), not a biopsy or TURP. Malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason score is clearly stated. All other details like high-grade PIN or margins aren't relevant for these specific fields. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as kyllä, and Gleason as 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
