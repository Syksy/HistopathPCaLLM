Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is typically a radical prostatectomy. The abbreviation for that is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The text says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant lesion, and also mentions "invasioivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4 is the major, 3 is the minor, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, only the worst lesion's results are needed. The report mentions a malignant lesion with Gleason 4+3, which is the primary one. Other findings like high-grade PIN are not the worst, so they're ignored.

Double-checking the fields: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. All required fields are present and correctly formatted. No issues here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
