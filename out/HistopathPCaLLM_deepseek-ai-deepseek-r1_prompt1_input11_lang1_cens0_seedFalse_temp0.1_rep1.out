Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. In medical terms, RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "maligni pesäke", which translates to "malignant focus". There's also mention of "high-grade PIN" which is a pre-cancerous condition, but the presence of malignant cells means the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". So that would be "4+3=7". Even though there's other info like tumor size and percentage, the Gleason is clearly given here.

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions a malignant focus in the apex and central part, but no other malignancies in the base or seminal vesicles. So the primary is 4+3=7. Also, the margins are clear, but that doesn't affect the Gleason score.

Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" is indeed a radical prostatectomy sample, so "RP" is correct. Malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All other details like weight, size, or PIN are not needed for the structured data requested.
