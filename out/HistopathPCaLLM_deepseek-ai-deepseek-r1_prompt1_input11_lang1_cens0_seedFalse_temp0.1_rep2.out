Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti käynnistetään..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to a prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, which is typically a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be RP.

Next, determining malignancy. The report mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to a malignant focus. Additionally, it talks about "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue) and "high-grade PIN" which is a premalignant condition but not malignant itself. However, since there's a clear mention of a malignant lesion, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3." The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So it should be "4+3=7". The report doesn't mention any other Gleason scores, and since malignancy is present, we include this value.

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is RP because it's a prostatectomy specimen. Malignancy is confirmed with the malignant focus. Gleason is correctly formatted as 4+3=7. No other lesions are mentioned that would contradict using the worst (highest) Gleason here. Margins are clean, but that doesn't affect the malignancy status. High-grade PIN is noted but isn't malignant, so it doesn't change the malignancy answer. Basiksessa and vesikkeleissä (base and seminal vesicles) have no malignancy, but the main lesion is malignant. So the final JSON should have those three fields correctly filled.
