Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed using an electrified loop. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says "majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue... classified as benign." Since it's benign, Malignancy would be "no".

For Gleason grade, the allowed values are in the format major+minor=sum or NA if benign. Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason score reported. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "no", and Gleason as "NA". Need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but here there's only benign tissue mentioned. So the final answer should be straightforward.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
