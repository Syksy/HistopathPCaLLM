Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The text mentions "sample" but doesn't specify the type. It says "prostate cancer tissue," but the method of obtaining isn't clear. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement starts with "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue..." Since prostate cancer is a malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes."

Third, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The given text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being in the queue, but no actual grades are reported. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is yes because cancer is present, and Gleason is NA because there's no grade mentioned. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and without nested structures. Let me double-check the input text again to confirm there's no hidden info I missed. Nope, nothing about sample type or Gleason. So the final JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
