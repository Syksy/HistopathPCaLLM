Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The text mentions the sample is from prostate cancer tissue but doesn't specify the procedure. Words like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So I should mark Sampletype as NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The provided text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being queued, but no specific grades. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but since there's only one mentioned (prostate cancer tissue), that's straightforward. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype: NA, Malignancy: yes, Gleason: NA. That seems right. No typos, and the allowed values are respected.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
