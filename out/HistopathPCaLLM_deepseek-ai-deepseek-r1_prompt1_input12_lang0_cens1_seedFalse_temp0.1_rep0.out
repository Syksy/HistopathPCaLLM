Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The text mentions "sample" but doesn't specify the type. It says "prostate cancer tissue," but the procedure isn't clear. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement starts with "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue..." Since prostate cancer is a malignant tumor, Malignancy should be "yes."

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination but doesn't provide specifics on grading. So Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but since there's no mention of multiple lesions or grades, it's straightforward here. The answer should be in JSON without nested structures. Let me double-check each field again. Sampletype isn't specified, so NA. Malignancy is yes because of prostate cancer. Gleason isn't mentioned, so NA. That seems right.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
