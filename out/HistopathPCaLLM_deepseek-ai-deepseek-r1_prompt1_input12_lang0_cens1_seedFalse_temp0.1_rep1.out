Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The text mentions "sample" but doesn't specify the type. It says "prostate cancer tissue," but that's the diagnosis, not the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement clearly says "prostate cancer tissue," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is yes.

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination but doesn't provide specific numbers. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as yes, and Gleason as NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no conflicting info, this should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
