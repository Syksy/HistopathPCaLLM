Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The text mentions "obtained sample" but doesn't specify the method. It just says it's prostate cancer tissue. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So for Sampletype, the answer should be NA since the type isn't specified.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement starts with "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue..." The term "prostate cancer" clearly indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The provided text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being in the queue, but no actual grades are reported. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion into account, but since there's only one mentioned (prostate cancer tissue), that's straightforward. Also, the structured data shouldn't have nested structures, so just a flat JSON with those three keys.

Double-checking each part: Sampletype isn't specified, Malignancy is yes because of "prostate cancer", and no Gleason details are present. So the final JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
