Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathology report from prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The input is a free-text report in Finnish, and I need to extract three pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade.

First, let's look at the sample type. The original text says "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut". The term "elektrosektiolastut" refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So there are no malignant findings. The value for "Malignancy" should be "ei".

Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason grade doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if there are no malignant findings, Gleason should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scores in the text either, which confirms that.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with the exact keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Let me double-check the example provided to ensure the format matches. Yes, looks good. All required fields are present with the correct allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
