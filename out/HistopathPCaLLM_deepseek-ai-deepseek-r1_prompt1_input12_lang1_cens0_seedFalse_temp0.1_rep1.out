Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The term "elektrosektiolastut" translates to electroresection chips, which I think refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So there's no malignancy here. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The instruction says to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei" (no), the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". Let me double-check the terms to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. "Elektrosektiolastut" definitely aligns with TURP. The report clearly states benign, so no Gleason needed. Yep, that seems right.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
