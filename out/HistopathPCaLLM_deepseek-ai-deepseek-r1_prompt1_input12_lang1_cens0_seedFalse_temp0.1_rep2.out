Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The term "elektrosektiolastut" translates to electroresection chips, which is typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So the malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since the findings are benign, there wouldn't be a Gleason grade reported. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So the Gleason field is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example provided helps confirm the format. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is TURP, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. That fits the requirements. No issues here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
