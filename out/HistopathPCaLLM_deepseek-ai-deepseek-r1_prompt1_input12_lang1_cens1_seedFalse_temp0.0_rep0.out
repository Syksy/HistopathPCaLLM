Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The mention of "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue) and "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" (initiated in eight parts) suggests a biopsy, as biopsies are often taken in multiple sections. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the report states that high-resolution images are still waiting in the digital pathology queue. Since the examination isn't complete yet, there's no confirmation of malignancy. The presence of suspected tissue doesn't confirm malignancy, so the answer here should be "NA" because the results are pending.

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed (it's still pending), the Gleason score can't be determined. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure follows the syntax without nested structures and uses the exact allowed values.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
