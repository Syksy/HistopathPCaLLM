Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key word here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The term "biopsiasta" (from biopsy) isn't present here, but the mention of a suspected cancer tissue sample divided into parts might suggest a biopsy. However, without explicit terms like RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), I'm uncertain. The sample is just described as being initiated in eight parts, which could be a biopsy procedure. But since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the safest choice is "NA" here. Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the sample is "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue), but the procedure isn't clearly stated. Maybe the sample type isn't specified, so "NA" is appropriate.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says it's a suspected cancer tissue ("epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta"). However, the report mentions that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. So, the actual histological examination might not have confirmed malignancy yet. The presence of suspected cancer cells doesn't confirm malignancy. Since the results are pending, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer here should be "NA" because the report doesn't state a confirmed malignancy; it's still under investigation.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed (we put "NA" for malignancy), the Gleason should also be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason grades in the text. The example included Gleason scores when malignancy was present, but here, even though it's suspected, without confirmed malignancy or Gleason details, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is pending, so "NA". Gleason not mentioned, so "NA".
