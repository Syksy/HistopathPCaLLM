Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key word here is "näyte" which translates to sample, and "käynnistetty" might refer to how it was taken. However, the exact type isn't clearly stated. The sample is suspected to be cancerous tissue, but the report doesn't mention if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since there's no explicit mention, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which translates to "suspected prostate cancer tissue". However, the report later states that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. Since the examination isn't complete yet, there's no confirmation of malignancy. The presence of suspected cancer cells isn't enough for a definitive "kyllä" because the final results are pending. Therefore, malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report is waiting for more data, there's no Gleason score provided. Thus, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should reflect that the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is pending, and Gleason isn't available. I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the three specified fields. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted as per the allowed options.
