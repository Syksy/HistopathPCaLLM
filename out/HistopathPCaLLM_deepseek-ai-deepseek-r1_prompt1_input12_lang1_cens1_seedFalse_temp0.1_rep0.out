Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each requirement.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The mention of "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected prostate cancer tissue) and the fact that it's divided into eight parts might suggest a biopsy, as biopsies are often taken in multiple sections. However, the text doesn't explicitly state "biopsia" (biopsy). But since it's a sample taken for suspicion of cancer, biopsy is the most likely. Alternatively, if it were RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), it might mention surgery or resection. Since those terms aren't present, I'll go with "biopsy" for Sampletype.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means suspected cancerous tissue. However, the report states that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. So, the actual histological examination hasn't confirmed malignancy yet. The presence is suspected but not confirmed. Therefore, the malignancy can't be confirmed as "kyllä" (yes) because the results are pending. But the sample is from suspected cancer tissue. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the high-res images are pending, maybe the initial assessment hasn't found malignancy yet. The text says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta" (most of the sample appears to be from the prostate), but no mention of cancer cells found. So, since the report is pending further images, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report hasn't found any yet because the images are pending, then the answer would be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA" if the information isn't available. But the sample is from suspected cancer tissue. However, the histology hasn't confirmed it yet. So, since the report doesn't state any malignancy found, just that it's suspected, the answer should be "ei" because the findings aren't confirmed. Alternatively, if the report is pending, maybe it's "NA". But according to the instructions, if there's no malignancy, Gleason is "NA". Let me check the example again. In the example, when malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason is provided. Here, since the report is pending, maybe malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy has been identified yet. So, Malignancy: "ei".

Third, Gleason. If Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". Since the report is waiting for high-res images, there's no Gleason score reported yet. Therefore, Gleason: "NA".

Putting it all together:
Sampletype: "biopsy" (since it's a sample taken for suspected cancer, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: "ei" (no malignancy found yet, pending images)
Gleason: "NA" (because no malignancy confirmed)
