Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The mention of "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" (started in eight parts) suggests that it's a biopsy, as biopsies are often taken in multiple sections. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which translates to "suspected prostate cancer tissue". However, the report states that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. Since the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed (as the images are pending), there's no definitive diagnosis yet. The question is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. Since the results are pending, it's not confirmed. But the sample is from suspected cancer tissue. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – "Were there malignant findings in the sample?" The text doesn't confirm any malignancy yet; it's still pending. So the answer here might be "ei" (no) because they haven't found it yet, or "NA" because the results are pending. But the options are only yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, maybe "ei" is appropriate. Alternatively, if the suspicion is considered as a possible "kyllä", but I think since the high-res images are pending, they haven't confirmed, so "ei" or "NA". The example given in the instructions had a confirmed case as "kyllä". Here, it's suspected but not confirmed. The correct approach here is to check if the report states any malignancy. The text says "epäillystä" (suspected), but no actual findings are reported yet. So the answer would be "ei" because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the data isn't available. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample is from suspected cancer, but the actual histology is pending, perhaps the malignancy field should be "NA" because the results aren't available yet. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the examination hasn't been completed (images pending), then the answer might be "NA" because the assessment isn't complete. But the text says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta" – most of the sample seems to be from the prostate, but no mention of malignancy. So maybe the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei". But I'm not sure. The example given in the instructions had a clear case where malignancy was present. Here, it's pending. Since the high-res images are pending, the current findings don't confirm malignancy. So "ei" might be correct. Alternatively, if the sample is suspected but not confirmed, maybe "NA". But the options don't have a "pending" value. The user instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. Wait, no: "sallitut arvot 'kyllä', 'ei' tai 'NA'". So "NA" is for when it's not applicable, perhaps when the sample isn't malignant or the information isn't available. In this case, since the examination isn't complete (pending images), maybe "NA" is better. But the user's example used "kyllä" when malignancy was present. Here, the report doesn't state any malignancy yet, just suspicion. So the answer is "ei" or "NA". I think "NA" might be more appropriate here because the assessment isn't complete. But I need to check the exact wording. The text says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta, mutta korkearesoluutioiset kuvat ovat toistaiseksi odottamassa digipatologian jonossa." So the initial assessment is that the sample is from the prostate, but high-res images (which are needed for detailed analysis) are pending. So the malignancy hasn't been determined yet. Therefore, the answer for Malignancy should be "NA" because the results are pending. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm or deny malignancy, "NA" would indicate that the information isn't available. So I'll go with "NA" for Malignancy.

Third, Gleason score. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed (or the assessment is pending), the Gleason score would be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so even if malignancy were suspected, without the actual grades reported, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "biopsy", Malignancy is "NA", Gleason is "NA".
