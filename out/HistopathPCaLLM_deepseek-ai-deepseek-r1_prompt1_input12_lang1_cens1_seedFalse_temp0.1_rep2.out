Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text here is "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" which translates to started in eight parts. But I need to figure out the sample type. The term "näyte" (sample) is mentioned, but there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's a suspected cancer tissue and divided into parts, maybe it's a biopsy? But the example given for biopsy had "prostata biopsiasta" explicitly. Here, it's not clear. The report mentions that most of the sample seems to be from the prostate, but high-resolution images are pending. Without explicit terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe the sample type is NA. But wait, the first part says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which is suspected cancerous tissue. Could this imply biopsy? Hmm. The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". Here, the sample is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" which might refer to being processed in parts, but not necessarily the procedure type. Since the procedure isn't specified, maybe Sampletype is NA.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which translates to suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the report states that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. So, the histological examination hasn't been completed yet. The presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here; it's still under suspicion. The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is a confirmed malignancy. Here, since the results are pending, maybe Malignancy is NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the examination is pending, then the answer might be NA. Alternatively, if the suspicion is noted but not confirmed, maybe it's still NA. The key is whether the report states any confirmed malignancy. Since it's only suspected and the images are pending, the answer is likely "ei" (no) because no malignancy has been found yet, or NA. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the examination is pending, then the result isn't available yet. So maybe Malignancy is NA. But the example had a confirmed case. Here, since the high-res images are pending, the analysis isn't complete. So the answer would be NA for malignancy because it's not determined yet.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed (pending), the Gleason would be NA. Even if there's suspicion, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported. So in this case, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA. Malignancy is pending, so NA. Gleason also NA. Let me check the original text again. The sample is "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" (suspected cancerous tissue), but the histology is still under examination. So no confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, the answers would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure type isn't mentioned)
Malignancy: NA (results pending)
Gleason: NA (no malignancy confirmed)
