Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so the Sampletype should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "In sample B carcinoma is observed." Since carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The user wants the format "major+minor=sum." Here, 4+5=9. Even though there's a mention of Gleason score 5, the highest or most severe lesion is the 4+5=9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given in the instructions uses the highest reported, so even if there's a lower score mentioned, the highest one is taken. The 20% on the left might refer to the extent, but the grade itself is 4+5=9. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have "biopsy" for Sampletype, "yes" for Malignancy, and "4+5=9" for Gleason. No nested structures, just flat JSON keys. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example to ensure compliance. Everything seems to fit.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
