Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the raw data, the statement starts with "prostate needle biopsies." So that clearly indicates the sample type is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text here says "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The correct format would be "4+5=9." Even though the text mentions "Gleason score 5," the highest or most severe lesion is the one with 4+5=9. The other part about 20% might refer to the percentage of higher grade, but the main Gleason reported is 4+5=9. So Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided doesn't have any, so just key-value pairs. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. Even though there's a mention of Gleason score 5, the highest sum is 9, so that's the one to report.

Double-checking the fields: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. All values are correctly formatted as per the allowed options. No NA needed here since all information is present.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
