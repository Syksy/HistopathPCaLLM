Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so the allowed value here is "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "In sample B carcinoma is observed." Since carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The preferred format is major+minor=sum. So combining those numbers, it should be "4+5=9." Even though there's mention of a Gleason score 5 earlier, the highest or most severe is the 4+5=9. The user specified to take the most severe lesion, so that's the one to use.

I need to make sure the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the exact keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Also, check allowed values for each field. Everything seems to fit here. No NA needed since all info is present. Alright, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
