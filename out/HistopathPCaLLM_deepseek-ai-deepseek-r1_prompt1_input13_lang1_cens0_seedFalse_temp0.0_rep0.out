Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita tyyppipaikoista otettuna". The term "paksuneulabiopsioita" translates to "thick-needle biopsies", which I know is typically referred to as a biopsy. So the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", which means carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The correct format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4 and 5 add up to 9, so it should be "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The other samples are normal, so the main focus is on sample B. Also, the JSON structure shouldn't have nested elements. All values are present and fit the allowed options. No NA needed here since all information is available.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
