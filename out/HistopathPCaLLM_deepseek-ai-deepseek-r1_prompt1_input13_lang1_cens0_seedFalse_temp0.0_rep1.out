Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita". The term "biopsioita" translates to biopsies, so the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", which means carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the malignancy field should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers, or "NA" if benign. The text mentions "Gleason tasolle 5" and "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The total is 9, composed of 4 and 5. The major pattern is the higher number, which is 5, and the minor is 4. So the correct format here is "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, only the worst lesion's results are to be reported. The text mentions that in sample B, there's carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples are normal. So the worst is from sample B, which is what we include.

Double-checking the sample type: "paksuneulabiopsioita" refers to core needle biopsies, which falls under "biopsy". Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is correctly formatted as per the given example. All fields are accounted for, and the values are within the allowed options. No issues here.
