Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita tyyppipaikoista otettuna". The term "paksuneulabiopsioita" translates to "thick-needle biopsies", which I think refers to a biopsy procedure. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", which means carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4 and 5 add up to 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9". Even though there's mention of "menee jo Gleason tasolle 5", which might refer to the primary pattern, the sum is clearly given as 4+5=9. The example provided in the instructions uses a similar structure, so following that format is key.

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions that sample B has carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples are normal. So the worst is from sample B, which is correctly captured.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON. All three fields are top-level. Also, check that all values are within the allowed options. Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is kyllä, and Gleason is in the correct format. Everything seems to fit. No issues here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
