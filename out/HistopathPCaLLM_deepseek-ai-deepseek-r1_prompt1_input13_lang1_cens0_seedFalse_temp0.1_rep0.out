Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the given input text carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the input text here, the first sentence starts with "Näytteinä prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita tyyppipaikoista otettuna..." The term "paksuneulabiopsioita" translates to "thick-needle biopsies", which is a type of biopsy. So the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The input text states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa..." which means "Carcinoma is detected in sample B". Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text mentions "Gleason tasolle 5 ja kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The total is 9, composed of 4 and 5. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9". Even though it says "menee jo Gleason tasolle 5", which might refer to the primary pattern being 5, the actual sum given is 4+5=9. The structure requires the major and minor components, so 4+5=9 is correct here.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided doesn't nest anything, so just the three top-level keys. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The input mentions that in sample B there's carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples are normal. So we take the worst one, which is 4+5=9.

Double-checking the sample type again. "Paksuneulabiopsioita" is definitely a biopsy, so "biopsy" is correct. Malignancy is confirmed as "kyllä" because carcinoma is present. Gleason is correctly formatted as per the example. All fields seem to fit the requirements.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
