Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: the first sentence mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita". The Finnish word "biopsioita" translates to biopsies, so the sample type here is "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", which means carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is malignant, so malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers, or "NA" if benign. The text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". Here, the total is 9, composed of 4 and 5. The standard format is major (higher grade) first, so 4+5=9. Wait, but the order here is written as 4+5, which sums to 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value structure. All three fields are present and correctly filled. Let me double-check each part again.

Sampletype: "paksuneulabiopsioita" is definitely a biopsy. Malignancy: carcinoma is present, so "kyllä". Gleason: the report explicitly states 4+5=9. No other lesions are mentioned as worse, so this is the primary one. The other samples have normal tissue, so only sample B's result matters here. The answer should be correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
