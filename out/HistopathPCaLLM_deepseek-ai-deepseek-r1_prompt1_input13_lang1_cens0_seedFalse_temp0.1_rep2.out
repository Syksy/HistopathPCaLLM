Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita", which translates to "thick needle biopsies of the prostate". The Finnish word "biopsioita" clearly indicates biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", which means "Carcinoma is detected in sample B". Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the malignancy field should be "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text mentions "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". Here, the total is 9, composed of 4 and 5. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9". 

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions that in sample B, there's carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples show normal structure. So the worst is indeed 4+5=9. 

No nested structures allowed in the JSON, so straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
