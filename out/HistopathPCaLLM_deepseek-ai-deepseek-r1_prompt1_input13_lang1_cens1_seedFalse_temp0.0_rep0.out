Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." The term "näytteet" means samples, but the original type isn't explicitly mentioned. The example used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern). However, it also says they need to consult a colleague and confirmation is needed. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? The example required malignancy only if confirmed. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The example used "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, perhaps the malignancy is not confirmed, so maybe "ei" or NA. But the question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant yet. Alternatively, maybe NA. Hmm. The example had a clear malignancy. In this case, since they need to consult, it's uncertain. The instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the worst is suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Or maybe "kyllä" if suspicious is considered as possible malignancy. But according to medical reporting, suspicious might be considered as not confirmed, hence "ei". But I'm not sure. Let me check the example again. The example had a clear adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, it's not clear. The text says "poikkeavaisuuksia" (abnormalities) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern), but needs consultation. So perhaps the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei" or NA. The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the sample B has abnormalities but it's not confirmed as malignant, maybe the answer is "ei"? Or maybe "kyllä" if suspicious is considered as malignant. But I think in medical terms, until it's confirmed, it's not classified as malignant. So Malignancy would be "ei". Wait, but the example had "kyllä" when it was confirmed. Here, it's not confirmed, so maybe "ei". Alternatively, maybe the presence of suspicious findings is enough to mark as "kyllä", but the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe it's not classified as malignant yet. So "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei" in this case, Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the type isn't specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no confirmed malignancy), Gleason is NA.
