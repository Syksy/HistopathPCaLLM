Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the report mentions "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to "Samples were taken from the prostate's typical locations." The term "näytteet" (samples) here is a bit generic. The original sample types like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly mentioned. Since there's no specific procedure named, I think the correct answer here is "NA" because we can't determine the exact sample type from the given information.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions that in sample B, there are some abnormalities ("poikkeavaisuuksia") with differentiation patterns that require consulting a colleague. It's described as "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern), but it hasn't been confirmed yet. The other samples show normal patterns without inflammation. Since the suspicious findings aren't confirmed as malignant yet and the rest are normal, the malignancy status isn't definitively positive. However, the presence of suspicious cells might lean towards "kyllä", but the report states that confirmation is needed. But according to the instructions, we should only report confirmed malignancies. Since it's still under consultation and not confirmed, maybe "ei" is safer. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If it's suspicious but not confirmed, should we mark it as "ei" or "NA"? The options are only yes, no, or NA. Since the sample B is suspicious but not confirmed, and others are normal, maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy reported. Alternatively, if "suspekti" is considered as possible malignancy, but the user instructions say to report only the worst lesion. However, since it's not confirmed, perhaps "ei" is correct. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. In this case, the report is uncertain. The user might expect "kyllä" if there's suspicion, but according to the rules, maybe it's better to go with "ei" because it's not confirmed. Or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, perhaps "ei" is not correct. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, then technically, the answer would be "ei" because malignancy isn't confirmed. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the status is uncertain. But the options don't have an uncertain value. The example given in the problem statement uses "kyllä" when malignancy is present. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" is the answer. But I need to be careful. Let me check the original text again. The report says "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia... suspekti patterni... tarvitaan konsultaation kautta." So, they found some suspicious patterns but need a consultation to confirm. Since it's not confirmed, the malignancy isn't definitively present. Therefore, the answer should be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. The other samples are normal. So, the worst lesion here is the suspicious one in sample B, but since it's not confirmed, malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" in this case, the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no confirmed malignancy, and Gleason is "NA".
