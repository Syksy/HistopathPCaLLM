Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to "Samples were taken from the prostate's typical locations." The term "biopsia" (biopsy) isn't explicitly mentioned here. The other options are RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), but there's no indication of surgery being performed. Since it's about taking samples from the prostate, but the exact type isn't specified, I might have to go with "NA" here. Wait, but in the example given, "prostata biopsiasta" led to "biopsy". Here, the text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern). However, it also says that confirmation is needed via consultation. The other samples have normal patterns without inflammation. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If the suspicious finding is the worst, but it's not confirmed, maybe the malignancy is still "kyllä"? Or since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei"? Wait, the example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is clearly malignant. Here, the suspicious pattern isn't confirmed. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's only suspected and needs consultation, maybe the answer is "ei" or "NA". But the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, so perhaps "ei" isn't correct either. Wait, the user instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's only suspected and not confirmed, then technically, there's no confirmed malignancy. So maybe "ei"? But the example had a clear malignancy. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if uncertain. But the options don't include uncertainty. Hmm. The text says "poikkeavaisuuksia" (abnormalities) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern), which might imply possible malignancy but not confirmed. Since the user wants the worst lesion's results, and if the worst is a suspicious but unconfirmed case, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant. Or maybe "kyllä" because it's suspected? This is a bit ambiguous. But according to medical reporting, unless malignancy is confirmed, it's not reported as positive. So perhaps "ei" here. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the presence of malignancy is uncertain. The user's example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's not confirmed. So maybe "ei" or "NA". The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, then technically, the answer is "ei". So Malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, else "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei" in this case, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: ei (since no confirmed malignancy)
Gleason: NA
