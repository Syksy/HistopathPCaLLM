Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." The term "näytteet" translates to samples, and "biopsiasta" would mean biopsy. However, the original text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since it's talking about samples taken from typical locations but doesn't specify the procedure, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern). However, it also says they need to consult a colleague and confirmation is needed. So it's suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. The other samples have normal patterns and no inflammation. Since malignancy requires confirmation, and the report doesn't state it definitively, the answer here might be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA". But according to the instructions, if there's no confirmed malignancy, perhaps "ei" is appropriate. Wait, but the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant yet. Or does "suspekti" imply possible malignancy? The user's example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's uncertain. The report says they need to consult, so maybe it's not confirmed. So "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy stated. But I'm a bit unsure here. Alternatively, maybe NA if the presence is uncertain. Hmm.

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. The example included Gleason when malignancy was present. Since in this case, malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy, just suspicious findings needing consultation. Gleason is NA as there's no mention of it.
