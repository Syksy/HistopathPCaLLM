Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." I think that's a typo and should be "prostatectomy," which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma." Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The statement says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%." Wait, Gleason 7 can be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion here is score 3, which is 60%, so the major component is 3 and minor is 4. So it should be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses "4+3=7" as the format, so following that, "3+4=7" is correct here. The sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the original text for any other possible mentions, but it seems clear. No other tumor findings are mentioned as more severe. So the final JSON should have those three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
