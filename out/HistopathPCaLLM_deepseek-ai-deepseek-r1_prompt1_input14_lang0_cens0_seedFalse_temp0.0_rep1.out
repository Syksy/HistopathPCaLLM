Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query to understand exactly what they want. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, and only the most severe lesion's results should be considered.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" is probably a typo, likely meaning "prostatectomy". A prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, and "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here is "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The statement says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The text mentions the larger portion is score 3 (60%), which would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. Also, check if there's any more severe lesion mentioned, but the text only refers to one tumor. So the structured JSON should be as above.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
