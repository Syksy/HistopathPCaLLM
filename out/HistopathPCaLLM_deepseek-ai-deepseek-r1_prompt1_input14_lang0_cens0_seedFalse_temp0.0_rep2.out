Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think that's a typo for "prostatectomy", which is a radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The text says "tumorous growth" and mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The statement says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with the larger portion being score 3 (approx 60%). Wait, Gleason score is determined by the two most common patterns. If the major is 3 and minor is 4 (since 3+4=7), but the text says "larger portion of score 3". So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should follow that. Let me double-check each part again. Sampletype is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7. That seems right.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
