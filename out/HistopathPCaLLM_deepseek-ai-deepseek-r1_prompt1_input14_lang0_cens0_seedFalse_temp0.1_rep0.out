Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they want. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are given, and only the most severe lesion's results should be used.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" is probably a typo for "prostatectomy". The correct term for the surgical removal of the prostate is radical prostatectomy, abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes".

Third, Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The statement says, "the found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The text mentions the larger portion is score 3 (approx 60%). In Gleason grading, the primary (major) pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. If the larger portion is 3, then the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making it 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Now, checking if there's a more severe lesion mentioned. The text talks about tumors reaching near the capsule but no breach. The main tumor is Gleason 7. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere, so this is the most severe.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures. Also, check for typos. The user example uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should follow that. Double-checking the original text for any other possible mentions, but it seems clear. The answer should be as specified.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
