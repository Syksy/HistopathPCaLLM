Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think that's a typo for "prostatectomy", which is the surgical removal of the prostate. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here should be RP.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The report says "tumorous growth" and mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 (60%) would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4. So it should be 3+4=7. But the way it's written here is "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". So the major is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "3+4=7".

Let me double-check. The sample type is RP because it's a prostatectomy specimen. Malignancy is yes because carcinoma is present. Gleason is 3+4=7 since the larger portion is 3. The answer should be structured in JSON without nested structures, only the most severe lesion. The example uses "4+3=7" as the format, so following that, "3+4=7" is correct.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
