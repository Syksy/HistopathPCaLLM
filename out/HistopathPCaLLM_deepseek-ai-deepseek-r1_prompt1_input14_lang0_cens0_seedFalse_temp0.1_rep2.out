Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think that's a typo and should be "prostatectomy", which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma indicates malignancy, so Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The report states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with the larger portion being score 3 (60%). Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Since the major portion is 3, that would be 3+4=7. Wait, no—the major component is the higher grade. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). If the larger portion is 3 (60%), then the major is 3 and minor is 4, making 3+4=7. But sometimes, if two grades are present and the higher is more than 5%, it's considered. Wait, the user's example had 4+3=7, which would be major 4, minor 3. So in this case, the larger portion is 3 (60%), so major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". So the majority is 3, but the sum is 7. So 3 + 4 =7. Therefore, the correct format is 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP

Malignancy: yes

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should be valid with those keys and string values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
