Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatektomia-preparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, which is typically a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which means the tumors found are carcinoma (cancer) with Gleason 7. So malignancy is present. The allowed value here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and further details "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason scores are typically in the format major + minor = sum. Here, the sum is 7. The major component is the higher grade, but the text mentions the larger part (isompi osuus) has a score of 3. Wait, that's confusing. If the sum is 7, and the major component is 3, then the minor would be 4 (3+4=7). But usually, the major is the higher number. However, the text says "scoorauksella 3" for the larger part. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the major is 4 and minor 3, but the larger portion is 3. But according to Gleason grading, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. If the larger part is 3 (60%), then the primary would be 3, secondary 4, making 3+4=7. But the way it's written here might need careful parsing. The exact phrase is "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the larger portion (isompi osuus) has a score of 3, which would be the primary, and the minor would be 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to confirm that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only the worst lesion is reported. The example given uses "4+3=7", so the format is major + minor = sum. Wait, but in the example, 4+3=7 is a sum of 7 where major is 4 and minor 3. However, in the current case, if the major is 3 and minor 4, the sum is still 7, but the order is 3+4=7. However, in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most common pattern, and secondary (minor) is the next. But the current case states that the larger portion (isompi osuus) is score 3 (60%), so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct notation is 3+4=7. However, sometimes in reports, the higher grade is listed first regardless of extent. Wait, no, the standard is that the primary pattern is the most common, and secondary is the next, even if the secondary is higher grade. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. If the highest grade is present but not the most extensive, it's still the secondary. For example, if the majority is pattern 3 and a smaller part is pattern 4, the score is 3+4=7. If the majority is 4 and some 3, it's 4+3=7. So in this case, since the larger part is 3 (60%), the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason field is "3+4=7".

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions "pahimman leesion" in the instructions, so we take the highest Gleason score found. Since it's stated as Gleason 7, and the breakdown is 3+4, that's the correct entry.
