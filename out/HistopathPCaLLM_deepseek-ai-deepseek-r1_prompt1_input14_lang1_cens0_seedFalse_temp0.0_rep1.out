Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is often abbreviated as RP, so I think the sample type here is RP. That should be the first field.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa," which clearly states carcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and also mentions "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%." Gleason grading typically combines the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. If the total is 7, the possible combinations are 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The mention of the larger part (isompi osuus) being score 3 at 60% suggests that the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary is 4, making it 3+4=7. Wait, but wait—if the larger portion is 3 (60%), then primary is 3 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem shows "4+3=7" when the text mentions "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3." So the order matters based on which is major and minor. Here, since the major (primary) is 3 (60%), it's 3+4=7. But I need to confirm if the text explicitly states the order. The Finnish text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%." So the major component is 3 (60%), minor would be 4, since 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the original text for any possible errors. The sample is a prostatektomia-preparaatti, which is RP. The tumor is present, so malignancy is yes. Gleason 7 with major 3 (60%) so 3+4=7. Yes, that's correct.
