Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatektomia-preparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, which is typically a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which means the tumors found are carcinoma (cancer) with Gleason 7. So malignancy is present. The allowed value here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and further details "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason scores are typically in the format major + minor = sum. Here, the sum is 7. The major component is the higher grade, but the text mentions the larger part (isompi osuus) has a score of 3. Wait, that's confusing. If the sum is 7, and the major component is 3, then the minor would be 4 (3+4=7). But usually, the major is the higher grade. However, the text says "scoorauksella 3" for the larger part. Maybe the primary pattern is 3 and secondary is 4, making 3+4=7. But I need to check if the order is correct. In Gleason scoring, the first number is the primary (most prevalent) pattern, and the second is the secondary. However, if the larger portion (isompi osuus) is 3, then primary would be 3, secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the larger part (60%) is score 3, and the remaining 40% would be score 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The example given uses "4+3=7" when the text had 4 and 3. So the order here matters based on the primary and secondary patterns. Since the larger portion is 3, it's primary, so 3+4=7.
