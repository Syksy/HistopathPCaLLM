Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into a JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is a surgical removal of the prostate. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa". "Karsinoomaa" means carcinoma, which is malignant. So the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and further details "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason grading is based on the two most common patterns, major and minor. A total of 7 can be 3+4 or 4+3. Here, the major component (which is the higher grade) is score 3, but wait, that doesn't make sense because Gleason scores are composed of two numbers adding up to the sum. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The text says "scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the major component (which is the higher grade) is 3, but that would sum to 3+4=7? Wait, no. If the sum is 7, the possible combinations are 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The text mentions that the larger part (isompi osuus) is score 3, which is 60%. So the major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, making 3+4=7. But wait, in Gleason scoring, the first number is the primary (most prevalent) pattern, and the second is the secondary. However, if the sum is 7, the primary could be 3 or 4. But in the example given in the problem statement, "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7. So the order matters based on which is major. Here, the major component is 3 (60%), but that's conflicting because if the sum is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor would be 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the example in the problem statement has 4+3=7 when the major is 4. So in this case, since the major is 3 (60%), but the sum is 7, that would imply 3+4=7. However, the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista", which is the sum. So the correct format would be "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example shows that if the major is 4 and minor 3, it's written as 4+3=7. So the order is major + minor. Here, the major component is 3 (60%), but that's the primary pattern. Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if the two patterns are of different grades, the higher grade is listed first if it's the secondary. Wait, no. The current Gleason grading system (since 2016) uses the Grade Groups, but the original Gleason score is the sum of the most common (primary) and the next most common (secondary) patterns. However, if there are multiple patterns, sometimes the highest grade is considered even if it's less in quantity. Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me clarify.

In the traditional Gleason system, the score is the sum of the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (second most extensive) grade. However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller area, it might be considered. But in the problem statement's example, the primary is 4 and secondary is 3. In the current case, the text says "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%", which means the larger part (60%) is grade 3, and the remaining 40% is grade 4. Therefore, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, leading to 3+4=7. So the correct Gleason format here would be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is "RP" because it's a prostatectomy specimen.

Malignancy is "kyllä" because carcinoma is present.

Gleason is "3+4=7" based on the major component being 3 (60%) and minor 4, summing to 7.
