Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The input text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti". The Finnish term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which in the allowed values corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa". The presence of carcinoma (karsinoomaa) indicates malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason 7 typically consists of a primary and secondary pattern. The major component here is 3 (since it's the "isompi osuus" at 60%), but wait, Gleason 7 can be 3+4 or 4+3. However, the mention here is "Gleason 7-tasoista", which refers to the sum. The primary and secondary grades need to be determined. Since the major component is 3 (60%), the minor would be 4 to sum to 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the exact wording is "scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the score for the major component is 3, which is 60%, and the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to ensure no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions Gleason 7, which is the highest here. So the answer should be as structured.
