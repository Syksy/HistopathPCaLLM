Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to process a histopathological report from a prostatectomy specimen and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti". The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which indicates the presence of carcinoma. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and mentions "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason 7 typically is 3+4 or 4+3. Here, the major component is 3 (60%), so minor would be 4. Wait, but if the score is 3+4=7, but the way it's written here, the "scooraus" (scoring) for the major part is 3. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The Gleason sum is 7, and the major component is 3 (60%), so the minor would be 4. So the format should be "3+4=7". But the text just says Gleason 7. However, the example given in the problem uses the specific pattern with major and minor components. Since the user wants the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format, even though the text mentions "Gleason 7-tasoista" and the major component is 3 (60%), then it's 3+4=7. But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. Hmm. Wait, the example given in the problem had the text explicitly stating the grades 4 and 3, so they could form 4+3=7. Here, the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista" and mentions the major component is 3 (60%). So the minor would be 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But I need to confirm if the text provides both components. The text says "scoorauksella 3 n. 60%", which might mean the major pattern is 3 (60%) and the minor is 4 (40%), summing to 7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and only the worst lesion is considered. Since the report mentions Gleason 7 and the components, this should be correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
