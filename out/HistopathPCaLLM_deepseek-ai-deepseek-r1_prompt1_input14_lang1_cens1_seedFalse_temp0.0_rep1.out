Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Näyte koostuu kattavasta katsauksesta potilaan prostatakudokseen, ja on valmistettu ajettavaksi kaseteilla normaalin rutiinin mukaisesti." The mention of "kasetit" (cassettes) and the process sounds like a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the text also mentions "kattavampi näytteenotto" which suggests a more extensive sampling, but the original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Wait, maybe "kattava katsaus" refers to a biopsy? Or could it be a resection? The text doesn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection). Since it's not clear, maybe Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) which might be suspicious but not definitively malignant. There's a reference to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. The text says it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and a more comprehensive sampling is needed. So, there's no explicit mention of malignancy here. The findings are inconclusive, so Malignancy would be NA.

Gleason score. The example uses "major+minor=sum". The text refers to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample doesn't report a Gleason score. The recommendation is to do more sampling to rule out intermediate-grade findings. Since the current sample's Gleason isn't provided, it should be NA. The previous patient's score isn't relevant for this sample.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA. Malignancy isn't confirmed, so NA. Gleason isn't reported for this sample, so NA. The answer should have all three as NA.
