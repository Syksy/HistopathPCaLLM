Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as "Prostatakudos" and "näytteet" which are samples. The report talks about "kattavampi näytteenotto" (more comprehensive sampling), but the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. It mentions "näyte koostuu kattavasta katsauksesta potilaan prostatakudokseen" which translates to the sample consists of a comprehensive review of the patient's prostate tissue. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So I think the original sample type isn't specified here, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (peculiar growth structures) peripherally. It also refers to a colleague's patient who had a Gleason 7 classification, suggesting malignancy. However, the current report doesn't confirm malignancy; it's discussing further testing. The phrase "mahdotonta arvioida" (impossible to assess) regarding capsular penetration or margins. So there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy here. The recommendation is for more comprehensive sampling to exclude certain findings. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Malignancy should be "ei" or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report doesn't state malignancy is present, but there are suspicious findings. However, the user instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. If there's no explicit mention of malignancy, maybe it's NA. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is found. Here, the findings are "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" which might be atypical but not confirmed as malignant. Since the report doesn't state malignancy, but suggests further testing, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. Hmm. The user says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's a reference to another patient with Gleason 7, but that's not the current sample. The current sample's findings are inconclusive, so Malignancy would be "ei" only if benign, but if it's uncertain, maybe NA. Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The problem says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, but has suspicious features, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed, but the user might expect "kyllä" if there's suspicion. Wait, the example given in the problem had a clear adenocarcinoma, so "kyllä". Here, the text is more ambiguous. The key is whether the report states malignancy. Since it's not stated, and the assessment is pending, perhaps Malignancy is "ei" or NA. But according to the instructions, if there's no malignancy, it's "ei", and if it's uncertain, maybe NA. But the user's example uses "kyllä" when malignancy is present. Here, the report doesn't confirm malignancy, so maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. The text says "eivätkä ole vielä varmoja" (they are not sure yet), so maybe NA. But the options are only kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, and the report is suggesting further tests, perhaps Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in the sample) or NA (not assessed). But the presence of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be considered as possible malignancy. However, the user's instructions say to report only the worst lesion. If the current sample's findings are not confirmed as malignant, then Malignancy would be "ei". Alternatively, if the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe NA. But the options don't have 'suspicious', only yes/no/NA. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei" because the report doesn't state malignancy, but the example shows that if adenocarcinoma is found, it's "kyllä". Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the text again. The report mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" which are peculiar growth structures. That could be atypical but not necessarily malignant. The need for further testing suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed. So Malignancy should be "ei" because the sample doesn't show malignancy, but there are atypical findings. Or maybe NA? The problem says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there are no malignant findings, then "ei". If uncertain, NA. But the user's example uses "kyllä" when malignancy is present. Here, the answer is likely "ei" because the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's a need for more tests. So Malignancy: "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. However, the text mentions a colleague's patient with Gleason 7. But that's another patient, not the current sample. The current sample's Gleason isn't reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in the sample), Gleason is NA.
