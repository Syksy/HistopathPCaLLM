Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as "Näyte koostuu kattavasta katsauksesta potilaan prostatakudokseen" which translates to a comprehensive review of the prostate tissue. It also mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" which refers to samples being processed. The term "biopsia" (biopsy) isn't explicitly used here. The report talks about not being able to assess margins, which is common in biopsies, but since it's not directly stated, maybe the sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype might be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) peripherally. There's a reference to a colleague suggesting a more comprehensive sampling to exclude intermediate-grade GG findings and a previous patient with Gleason 7. However, the current report doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The unusual growths might be suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. So Malignancy could be "ei" or maybe NA. Wait, but the presence of Gleason 7 in a previous patient is mentioned, but that's not the current sample. Since the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe Malignancy is NA. Hmm, but the user wants the worst lesion's results. If the current sample has no confirmed malignancy, then Malignancy would be "ei" or NA. The text says "mahdotonta arvioida" (impossible to assess) regarding invasion or margins, but the presence of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be considered suspicious. However, without explicit mention of cancer, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. This is a bit ambiguous. The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. Here, since it's not confirmed, perhaps Malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the user wants the worst lesion's results. If there's no confirmed malignancy, then "ei". But if the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe NA. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state malignancy, then "ei". But the example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is clear. Here, it's unclear. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. The user might prefer "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if it's uncertain, maybe NA. The text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but that's not the current sample. So current sample's malignancy is not confirmed. So Malignancy: "ei"?

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since Malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason would be NA. But wait, the text mentions a colleague's patient had Gleason 7, but that's not the current case. The current sample's Gleason isn't reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA. Malignancy isn't confirmed, so "ei". Gleason is NA. But wait, the example had "biopsy" even though the Finnish word was "biopsiasta". Here, the sample is a "kattava katsaus" (comprehensive review) but not sure if that's a biopsy. The processing mentions "ajettiin" which is about cutting into cassettes, common in biopsies. But without explicit mention, maybe Sampletype is NA. Alternatively, if "prostatakudos" refers to a biopsy, but not sure. The user's example used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't use that term, so Sampletype is NA.

So final answer:

Sampletype: NA (since not explicitly biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: "ei" (since no confirmed malignancy, only unusual growths)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy, so no Gleason)
