Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Näyte koostuu kattavasta katsauksesta potilaan prostatakudokseen, ja on valmistettu ajettavaksi kaseteilla normaalin rutiinin mukaisesti." The word "katsaus" here might refer to a review, but the mention of "kaseteilla" (cassettes) is a hint. Biopsy samples are often processed in cassettes. However, the text doesn't explicitly state "biopsia" (biopsy), "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection). Since it's not clear, maybe the sample type is "NA" here. Wait, but the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So perhaps the sample type is "NA" because it's not specified.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (peculiar growth structures) which could be suspicious but not definitive. There's a reference to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current report doesn't confirm malignancy. The need for further examination suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed yet. So, since there's no explicit mention of cancer (like adenokarsinooma), the malignancy field might be "ei" or "NA". Wait, but "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be atypical but not necessarily malignant. The report also states it's impossible to assess invasion or margins. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because there's no confirmation, or "NA" if it's uncertain. However, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no clear malignancy, then "ei". But the example had "kyllä" when cancer was mentioned. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA". Hmm. The text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current case is being compared and suggests more sampling is needed to rule out intermediate grade findings. So the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. Therefore, "ei" might be appropriate, but maybe "NA" if the presence is uncertain. The instructions say "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the sample doesn't have malignant findings, then "ei". Since the report doesn't state any malignancy found, just suspicious structures needing further testing, perhaps "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". However, the text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but that's not the current sample. The current sample's Gleason isn't reported, so it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is "ei" because no confirmed malignancy. Gleason is "NA".
