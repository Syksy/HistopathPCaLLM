Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g..." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often described as chippings or shavings. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "does confirm adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material." Adenocarcinoma here is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." The Gleason score is typically the sum of the two most common grades. If the most represented is 4, then the major pattern is 4. Since the sum is 8, the minor would be 4 (4+4=8). So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure I'm only taking the most severe lesion. The text doesn't mention multiple lesions, just that adenocarcinoma is throughout. So the highest Gleason here is 4+4=8. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example. The example uses "biopsy" and the format "4+3=7". So my answer should follow that structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
