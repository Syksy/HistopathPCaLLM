Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often resulting in chips or shavings. Biopsy would typically be small cores or fragments, but the mention of "shavings" leans more towards TURP. So Sampletype is likely "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". Wait, if the most represented is 4, then major is 4. But the sum is 8, so minor would be 4 as well (4+4=8). However, sometimes the wording can be tricky. The phrase "along with its variants" might imply that the minor component is also 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no higher grade lesion mentioned. The user specified to take the most severe lesion. The text doesn't mention any other lesions, so this is the one.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. Let me check the allowed values again. All look good. The JSON should be as specified.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
