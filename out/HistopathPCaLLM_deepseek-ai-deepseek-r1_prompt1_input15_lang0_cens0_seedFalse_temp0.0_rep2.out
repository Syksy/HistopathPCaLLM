Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often resulting in chips or shavings. Biopsy would typically be small cores or fragments, but the mention of "shavings" leans more towards TURP. So Sampletype is likely "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". Wait, if the most represented is 4, then the major pattern is 4. But the sum is 8, which would mean the minor is also 4 (4+4=8). However, sometimes in reports, if the highest grade is 4 and there's another component, but maybe the sum is 8 because of tertiary patterns? But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The example uses major+minor=sum. So here, the major is 4, minor is 4, sum 8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be straightforward. Let me check again. The sample type is TURP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+4=8. That fits the allowed values. The example uses "biopsy" for a similar structure, so TURP is correct here. The answer should be in JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
