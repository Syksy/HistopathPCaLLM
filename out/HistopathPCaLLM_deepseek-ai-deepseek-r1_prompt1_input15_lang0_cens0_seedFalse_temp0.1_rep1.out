Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the first field: Sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings". I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which often results in chippings or shavings. Biopsy samples are usually small pieces, but the term "chippings" here seems more aligned with TURP. So, Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, the Malignancy field. The text clearly states "confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So, Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". Since the most severe lesion is considered, and the sum is 8, the primary and secondary grades need to add up to 8. The most common combination for sum 8 is 4+4, but the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants". Variants of 4 might still be grade 4, so likely 4+4=8. However, sometimes it could be 5+3=8 if the minor is 3, but the text emphasizes that Gleason 4 is the most represented, implying major is 4. So, the correct format would be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure there's no nested structure in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
