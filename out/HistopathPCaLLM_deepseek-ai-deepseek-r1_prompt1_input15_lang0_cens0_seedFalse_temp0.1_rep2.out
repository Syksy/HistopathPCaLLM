Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the first field: Sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings". I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which often results in chippings or shavings. Biopsy samples are usually small pieces, but the term "chippings" here seems more aligned with TURP. So, Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text clearly states "confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So, Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". Since the sum is 8, and the primary pattern is 4, the secondary would also be 4 (since 4+4=8). So, Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the format correctly, so the JSON should follow that structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
