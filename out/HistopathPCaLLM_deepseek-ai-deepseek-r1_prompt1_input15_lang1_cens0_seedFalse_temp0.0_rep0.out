Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan höylälastuja". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Höylälastuja" translates to "chips" which is typical in a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa" which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report states "pistesumma 8" (score 8) and mentions Gleason 4 variants. The format should be major + minor = sum. Since the primary pattern is 4 and the secondary is also 4 (because 4+4=8), the Gleason would be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja". That suggests the major component is 4. If the sum is 8, then minor would be 4. So yes, 4+4=8. 

Double-checking the example given. The example had 4+3=7, so the format is correct. The answer should follow that structure. All fields seem to fit. No nested structures, just the three top-level keys. No other details needed. Looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
