Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan höylälastuja". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Höylälastuja" translates to "chips" in English, which is typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report states "pistesumma 8". The mention of Gleason 4 and its variants suggests the primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the secondary must be 4 as well (4+4=8). So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are correctly mapped to the allowed options. No other details are needed. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype: TURP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+4=8. Yep, that fits the example format provided. All set.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
