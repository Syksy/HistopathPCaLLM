Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja..." The term "höylälastuja" translates to "chips" in the context of prostate samples, which typically refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "edustavin Gleason 4:ää... pistesumma 8". Here, the primary pattern is 4, and since the total is 8, the secondary must also be 4 (4+4=8). However, the exact wording is a bit ambiguous. The phrase "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja" suggests that the main component is 4, but the secondary isn't explicitly stated. But since the sum is 8, and primary is 4, secondary has to be 4. So Gleason would be "4+4=8".

Wait, but sometimes in reports, if the sum is 8, it could be 5+3 or others. But the text says the most representative (edustavin) is Gleason 4 and its variants, leading to a sum of 8. So primary is 4, secondary is 4. Hence, "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures. The example given uses "4+3=7", so following that format. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields correctly filled based on the text.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
