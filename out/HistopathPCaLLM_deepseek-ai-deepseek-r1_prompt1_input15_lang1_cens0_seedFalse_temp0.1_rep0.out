Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja..." The term "höylälastuja" translates to "chips" in the context of a medical procedure. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically produces chip-like samples. So the Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was seen in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score: The report states "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". The primary pattern is 4, and since the sum is 8, the secondary must be 4 as well (4+4=8). However, the exact wording here is a bit ambiguous. The phrase "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" might mean the most representative (major) is 4, and the minor could be another pattern. But the sum is 8, so if major is 4, minor would need to be 4 to total 8. Alternatively, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, hence 4+4=8. The user example used "4+3=7", so the format should be "major+minor=sum". Therefore, the Gleason here is "4+4=8".

Wait, but the text says "pistesumma 8" (total score 8). The user example included both components, so even if the minor isn't explicitly stated, we have to infer from the total. Since the major is 4 and the sum is 8, minor must be 4. So the correct format is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions "lähes kaikissa" (almost all) samples have adenocarcinoma, so the worst is accounted for.
