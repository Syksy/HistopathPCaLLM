Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided example and the instructions again to make sure I understand correctly.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, and the input text here mentions "prostatan höylälastuja". I need to figure out what that corresponds to. "Höylälastuja" translates to "chips" in the context of a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), right? So TURP is the sample type here.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Then Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". Wait, "pistesumma" is the total score. But here, the primary pattern is 4, and since the total is 8, the secondary would be 4 as well (4+4=8). But the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. The user says to take the worst lesion's results. The example had 4+3=7. Here, the total is 8, and the primary is 4. So secondary must be 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja". Does that mean the major is 4 and minor is some variants, but maybe the minor is also 4? Because the sum is 8. So 4+4=8. That makes sense. So the Gleason is 4+4=8.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since höylälastuja refers to TURP chips)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example used "4+3=7" so the format is correct. The answer should be in JSON with those three keys.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
