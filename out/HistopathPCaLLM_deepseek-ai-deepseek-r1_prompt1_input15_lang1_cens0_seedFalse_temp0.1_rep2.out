Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostatan höylälastuja". I remember that "höylälastu" translates to "chips", which in medical terms often refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The report says "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text states "pistesumma 8" and mentions Gleason 4 variants. The typical format is major + minor = sum. Since the primary pattern is 4, and the total is 8, the minor must also be 4 (4+4=8). So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example uses "major+minor=sum", so combining the two 4s gives 8. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
