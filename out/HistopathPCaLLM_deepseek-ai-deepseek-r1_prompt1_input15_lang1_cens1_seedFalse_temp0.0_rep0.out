Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka..." which translates to the prostate tissue material being quite scarce. The term "skooppitutkimuksessa" refers to a scope examination, which is typically a biopsy. So the sample type here is likely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions that there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but the histopathology hasn't confirmed it yet. The key part is "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" meaning they can't confirm Gleason or other markers here. Also, it says potential findings need to be re-examined. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy from histopathology, only clinical suspicion, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't show malignant findings.

For Gleason score, the report states that clinical notes mentioned suspicion aligning with Gleason sum 8 or ISUP GG 4, but this isn't based on histopathology. Since the actual sample doesn't confirm any Gleason score, and there's no malignancy found in the sample, the Gleason field should be "NA".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA.
