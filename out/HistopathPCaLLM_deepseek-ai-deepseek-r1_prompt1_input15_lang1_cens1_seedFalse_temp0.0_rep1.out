Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "skooppitutkimuksessa" refers to a scope examination, which might be a biopsy. But there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). The text says the sample was processed with high priority due to clinical suspicion, but the original sample type isn't clearly stated. So maybe "NA" here.

Second, malignancy. The report mentions suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but the histopathology hasn't confirmed it yet. The alustavasti (preliminary) part says they can't confirm Gleason or other markers. So the presence of malignant findings isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's a suspicion without histopathological confirmation, the answer should be "ei" (no) because the actual sample doesn't show malignancy, or maybe "NA"? Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings in the sample. Since the report says they can't confirm Gleason or other markers, and the suspicion was based on clinical notes, not histopathology, the sample itself doesn't have confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The clinical notes mention suspicion of Gleason sum 8, but this isn't based on histopathology. The report states that representative Gleason couldn't be confirmed. So since there's no malignancy found in the sample, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy ei, Gleason NA. Let me check the example again. In the example, even though there was a suspicion, if the sample doesn't confirm it, the answer is based on the sample findings. Here, the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, so malignancy is "ei", Gleason NA. Sample type isn't specified, so NA.
