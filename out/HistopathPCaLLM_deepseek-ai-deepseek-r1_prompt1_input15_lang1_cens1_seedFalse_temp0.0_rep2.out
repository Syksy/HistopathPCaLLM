Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion results should be reported, and the structure shouldn't be nested.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka kokonaisuudessaan..." which translates to the prostate tissue material being quite scant. The term "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" (prostate tissue material) suggests a biopsy, but I need to check if there are any specific terms like "biopsia" (biopsy), "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't mention RP or TURP explicitly. The mention of "skooppitutkimuksessa" (scope examination) might refer to a biopsy. However, since the sample type isn't explicitly stated, I might have to consider "NA". But wait, the example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta", so maybe "biopsy" is inferred here. However, in the current text, there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The user might have to default to "NA" if it's not clear. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The text starts with "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which is just prostate tissue material. Without a specific procedure mentioned, maybe the sample type is "NA".

Next, the malignancy field. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" (representative Gleason or other markers cannot be confirmed at this point). The clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma ("kliiniset muistiinpanot mainitsivat epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta"), but this wasn't based on histopathology. The current report says that potential findings need to be re-examined in the next session. So, there's a suspicion but no confirmation. Since malignancy is determined by the presence of malignant findings in the sample, and the report doesn't confirm any, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the sample doesn't show malignancy yet. But wait, the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, the suspicion is mentioned, but the actual sample doesn't confirm it. So "Malignancy" should be "ei" because the current sample doesn't have malignant findings; they need to recheck. So "ei".

For Gleason, the value should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA". However, the text mentions that clinical notes suspected something like Gleason sum 8, but this wasn't based on histopathology. The report states that representative Gleason couldn't be confirmed. So even though there's a suspicion, the actual sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy confirmed in the sample)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy, no Gleason reported)

Wait, but the sample type. The text says "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which could be from a biopsy, TURP, or RP. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to put "NA". The example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was in the text. Here, there's no such term, so "NA" is appropriate.
