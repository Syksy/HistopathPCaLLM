Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "skooppitutkimuksessa" might refer to a scope examination, possibly a biopsy. However, the exact type isn't clearly stated. The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions that there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but it says "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" which means they couldn't confirm Gleason or other markers. Also, "potentiaaliset löydökset täytyy katsoa uudelleen" implies that potential findings need re-examination. Since there's no confirmed malignancy in the current sample, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm any malignant findings yet. The suspicion mentioned is from clinical notes, not the histopathology results here.

For Gleason score: The text refers to clinical notes mentioning suspicion of adenocarcinoma corresponding to Gleason sum 8 or ISUP GG 4 or higher, but it states "tämä ei pohjautunut histopatologiaan" meaning it's not based on histopathology. Since the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, Gleason should be NA. The example given in the instructions shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was confirmed in this sample. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy here.
