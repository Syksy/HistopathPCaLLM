Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka kokonaisuudessaan..." which translates to the sample being a prostate tissue material that's quite scant. The term "biopsiasta" was in the example, but here the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). However, since it's a tissue sample and the context is checking for cancer, it's likely a biopsy. But wait, the text also mentions "skooppitutkimuksessa" which might refer to a scope examination, possibly TURP. Hmm, but the example used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta". Here, there's no clear mention. The user might default to "NA" if unsure. But given the context of checking for cancer without specifying the procedure, maybe it's a biopsy. Alternatively, since the sample is scant, maybe it's a TURP? Not sure. Let me check again. The text says "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which is prostate tissue material. If it's a biopsy, they usually take multiple cores. But the mention of "skooppitutkimuksessa" (scope examination) might suggest TURP. However, without explicit terms, maybe the safest answer is "NA". But the example used "biopsy" when biopsy was mentioned. Here, since it's not clear, perhaps "NA" is better. Wait, the user instructions say to choose from the allowed values. If the sample type isn't specified, then "NA" is correct. So Sampletype: "NA".

Next, Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" (representative Gleason or other markers cannot be confirmed at this point). Also, "kliiniset muistiinpanot mainitsivat epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta" (clinical notes mentioned suspicion of adenocarcinoma), but this wasn't based on histopathology. The current report doesn't confirm malignancy, just that potential findings need to be re-examined. So there's no confirmed malignancy in the sample. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't show malignancy, even though there's suspicion. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). Since the report says they can't confirm Gleason or markers, and the suspicion is from clinical notes, not the histopathology, the answer would be "ei" because the sample itself doesn't show malignancy. So Malignancy: "ei".

Gleason: For malignant cases, it's "major+minor=sum", otherwise "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: "NA" (since the procedure isn't specified)
Malignancy: "ei" (no malignancy found in the sample)
Gleason: "NA" (because no malignancy)
