Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are given, so I need to make sure each field adheres to those.

First, let's look at the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "skooppitutkimuksessa" refers to a scoop examination, which is a type of biopsy. So the sample type here is likely "biopsy". There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but it explicitly says that representative Gleason or other markers couldn't be confirmed. The key part here is "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" and "tämä ei pohjautunut histopatologiaan". Since the histopathology doesn't confirm malignancy yet, and they need to re-examine in the next session, the current findings don't confirm malignancy. So malignancy should be "ei". Even though there's a clinical suspicion, the actual sample doesn't show malignant findings yet.

For Gleason score, the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text mentions that the clinical notes suspected something like Gleason sum 8 (ISUP GG 4 or higher), but this wasn't based on histopathology. Since the current sample doesn't confirm any Gleason score, and the report says they can't confirm it here, the Gleason field should be "NA". The key phrase is "edustavaa Gleasonia... ei voida vahvistaa".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. Also, check that there are no nested structures. The example given uses "Gleason": "4+3=7", but here it's NA because no malignancy was confirmed. Even though there's a suspicion, the actual sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, so Gleason remains NA.
