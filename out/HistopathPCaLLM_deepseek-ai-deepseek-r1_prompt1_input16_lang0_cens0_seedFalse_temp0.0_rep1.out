Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The inspected material consists of three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The key term here is "fusion biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "carcinoma focuses," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The statement says, "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." The Gleason score is 7, composed of the major and minor patterns. Since architecture 3 is covering 2/3 and 4 is 1/3, the major component would be 3 and the minor 4. However, the standard Gleason grading takes the most predominant pattern as the primary grade and the next most predominant as the secondary. But in cases where a higher grade is present, even if less in quantity, sometimes it's considered. Wait, the report mentions "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4 -type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third." So the majority is 3, and a smaller portion is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the conclusion part says "score 7 comes from... architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses "4+3=7" which is different, but in this case, it's 3+4=7. The order matters for the Gleason score, but the sum is the same. However, the user wants the major and minor as per the report. Since the majority is 3 and the minor is 4, the correct format is 3+4=7.
