Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the first field: Sample type. The text mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The term "biopsies" clearly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy." So that's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The presence of "carcinoma focuses" in the sample points to a malignant tumor. The allowed value here is "yes" since carcinoma is a type of cancer.

Now, the Gleason grade. The example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text states "Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Here, the major component (which is the higher grade) is 4, and the minor is 3. Even though the majority of the carcinoma is grade 3, the highest grade present is 4. According to Gleason grading rules, the primary grade is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common, but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller portion, it might affect the score. Wait, no—the primary grade is the most predominant, and the secondary is the second most. However, in cases where a higher grade is present but not the most common, the primary is still the most common. Wait, the text says "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. So I need to check the rules again. The Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade followed by the secondary (next most extensive). So if grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then primary is 3, secondary is 4, leading to 3+4=7. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. Wait, maybe the example was a typo? Let me confirm. In the example, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3," so the primary is 4, secondary 3, hence 4+3=7. So in the current case, the primary is 3 (since it's 2/3), secondary 4 (1/3), so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the user's example shows that the order is based on the grades mentioned, not the extent. Wait, no—Gleason score is always primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive). So in the current case, the primary is 3, secondary 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".
