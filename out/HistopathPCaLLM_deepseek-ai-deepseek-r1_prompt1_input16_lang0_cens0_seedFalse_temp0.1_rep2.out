Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The original sample type is mentioned as "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the answer here should be "biopsy."

Next, Malignancy. The text states "contains carcinoma focuses," which indicates a malignant tumor. So the answer is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text mentions "score 7 comes from... architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." Since the major grade is the higher one, even if it's a smaller portion, I need to check. Wait, Gleason scoring is based on the most common (major) and next most common (minor) patterns. If grade 3 is covering 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then the major is 4 (since it's higher grade) even if it's less in quantity? Wait, no. Wait, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. But if there's a higher grade, even if it's less, sometimes it's considered. Wait, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) might have different rules, but the user just wants major+minor=sum. 

Wait, the example given in the problem statement uses "4+3=7" where 4 is the major and 3 is the minor. So in the current case, the conclusion says the score 7 comes from architecture 3 covering 2/3 and architecture 4 covering 1/3. So the primary pattern is the most extensive, which is 3, and the secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be 3+4=7. But the user's example uses the higher grade first if they are different. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, secondary is the next. So if the majority is 3 and the secondary is 4, it's 3+4=7, sum 7. So the correct format here is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 3+4=7
