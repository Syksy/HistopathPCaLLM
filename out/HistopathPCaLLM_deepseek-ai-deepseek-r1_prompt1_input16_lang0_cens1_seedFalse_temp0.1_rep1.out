Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated here. The sample could be from a biopsy, but there's no direct mention. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text refers to "multiple suspicious foci," which suggests there's a suspicion of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. The conclusion says that grading needs to be done manually, implying that the digital assessment wasn't conclusive. So the presence of malignant tumor isn't confirmed here. Therefore, Malignancy might be NA as well.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses a format like "4+3=7." The text mentions that mid-grade differentiations (like 3+4 or 4+3) are hard to assess due to digitalization issues. However, the actual Gleason score isn't provided here because the digital images have resolution problems. They recommend manual grading. So there's no specific Gleason grade reported here. Hence, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's suspicious but not confirmed. Gleason is NA because no score was determined yet.
