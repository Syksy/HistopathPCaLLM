Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The terms "biopsy," "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly stated. Since the sample type isn't specified, I should put NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text refers to "multiple suspicious foci," which suggests possible malignancy, but there's no explicit confirmation of malignant tumor findings. The conclusion mentions that grading needs to be done manually, which implies uncertainty. Since it's not confirmed, the answer here should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows a format like "4+3=7." The text states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. They mention mid-grade differentiations (3+4 or 4+3) are hard to assess, but no actual Gleason score is provided. Therefore, the Gleason field should be NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified, Malignancy is NA since it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA because no score was given.
