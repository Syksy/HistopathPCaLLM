Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So the Sampletype here should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text clearly mentions "karsinoomafokuksia" (carcinoma foci), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

Now the tricky part: Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The example given was "4+3=7". The text here says "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." This translates to a score of 7, with Grade 3 architecture in about 2/3 and Grade 4 in 1/3. Since Grade 4 is higher than 3, the major component is 4 and minor is 3. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the text mentions "tason 3 graduksen kasvua, joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4". So the primary pattern is 3 and secondary is 4? But in Gleason scoring, the higher grade is taken as the primary if present. Wait, no. The Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (major) and the next most common (minor), but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller portion, it might still be considered. Wait, I need to recall the Gleason grading rules. The current system (Grade Groups) considers the primary and secondary patterns, but the Gleason score is the sum of the most predominant grade and the highest grade present, even if the highest is less prevalent. Wait, no. Actually, in the updated Gleason system, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if a higher grade is present, even if it's less common, it might affect the score. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The text says: "tason 3 graduksen kasvua, joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4". So the main growth is grade 3, and sometimes some grade 4. Then in the summary: "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So 3 is 2/3 and 4 is 1/3. Therefore, the primary pattern is 3 (since it's more prevalent), and the secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But wait, the example given in the problem statement was 4+3=7. So the order depends on which is the major and minor components. If grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then the major is 3 and minor is 4, leading to 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement had 4+3=7, which would be major 4 and minor 3. So in this case, the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order is major first. So in the current case, the major is the higher of the two? Or the most prevalent? Let me check the actual Gleason scoring rules. The Gleason score is determined by the sum of the most common grade (primary) and the highest grade (secondary) if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no. The current system (since 2016) uses the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) guidelines, where the Gleason score is the sum of the most predominant pattern and the highest remaining pattern. For example, if the tumor has 60% pattern 3 and 40% pattern 4, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. If it's 40% pattern 4 and 60% pattern 3, it's still 4+3=7, because the primary is the higher grade if it's the second most common? Wait, no. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, regardless of grade. So if the majority is pattern 3 (say 60%) and the next is pattern 4 (40%), then it's 3+4=7. If the majority is pattern 4 (60%) and next is pattern 3 (40%), then it's 4+3=7. So the primary is the most common, secondary is the next most common. But if there are multiple patterns, the secondary is the highest grade among the remaining. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The Gleason score is the sum of the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. However, if there are multiple grades present, even if a higher grade is less extensive, it's still considered. For example, if a tumor has 50% grade 3, 30% grade 4, and 20% grade 5, the primary is 3 (most extensive), secondary is 5 (highest remaining), so 3+5=8. But in the case where the most extensive is 3 (say 60%) and the next is 4 (40%), then it's 3+4=7. In the current case, the text says that in the summary, 3 architecture is 2/3 and 4 is 1/3. So the most extensive is 3, next is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order depends on which is the primary (most extensive) and which is the secondary. Therefore, in this case, the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. However, the user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which was translated to 4+3=7, implying that the order is the first mentioned. But in reality, the order is determined by the extent. So perhaps in the example, the primary was 4 and secondary 3, hence 4+3=7. In the current case, the primary is 3 (2/3) and secondary 4 (1/3), so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason here is "3+4=7".

But wait, the text says "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." So the summary states that the score is 7, with 3 architecture in about 2/3 and 4 in 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure that the user's example didn't have a different scenario. In the example, the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which was translated to 4+3=7, implying that the order is as listed. But in reality, the order should be based on the predominant pattern. So perhaps in that example, the primary was 4 and secondary 3, hence the sum. But in the current case, the primary is 3, so the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason here is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is "biopsy" because of "fuusiobiopsiaa".

Malignancy is "kyllä" because carcinoma is present.

Gleason is "3+4=7" based on the summary.
