Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa" which translates to three fusion biopsies. So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The report talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This translates to a score of 7, where the majority (2/3) is grade 3 and a minor part (1/3) is grade 4. Wait, but Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. The primary is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next most common. Here, grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, making the score 3+4=7. But the way it's written in the example is major (primary) + minor (secondary) = sum. So the correct format would be "3+4=7".

But I need to check the original text again. The user's example had "4+3=7" because the primary was 4. In the current case, the primary is 3 (since it's 2/3) and secondary is 4 (1/3). So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". The text mentions "score 7" which aligns with that sum. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me make sure there are no other details. The report mentions "Gleason 4 -tyypin silmukoituvaa rakennetta" which supports the presence of grade 4. The summary part confirms the score 7 with the breakdown. So the JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
