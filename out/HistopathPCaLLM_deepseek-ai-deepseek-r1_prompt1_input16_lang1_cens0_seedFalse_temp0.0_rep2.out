Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The report mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The text talks about "karsinoomafokuksia", which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason. The report says "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This indicates the primary pattern is 3 (2/3) and secondary is 4 (1/3). So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The correct format is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example in the instructions uses "4+3=7". Does the order matter here? The primary pattern is the higher grade if they are different. Wait, no, the primary is the most predominant, and secondary is the next. In the example, 4+3=7, which is primary 4, secondary 3. In the current case, the primary is 3 (2/3) and secondary 4 (1/3). So it should be 3+4=7. The order is based on prevalence, not the grade. So even though 4 is a higher grade than 3, if the primary (most prevalent) is 3, then it's 3+4. So the correct Gleason is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that the answer follows the "major+minor=sum" format. The major is the most common, minor the second. So yes, 3+4=7 here.
