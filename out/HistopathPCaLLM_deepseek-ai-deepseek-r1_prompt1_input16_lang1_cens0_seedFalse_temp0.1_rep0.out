Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". "Fuusiobiopsia" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The report talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". Here, the primary pattern (major) is 3 and the secondary (minor) is 4. But wait, Gleason grading is based on the two most prevalent patterns. However, in some cases, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller proportion, it might affect the score. The text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3", meaning 2/3 of the tumor is pattern 3 and 1/3 is pattern 4. Normally, the primary is the most prevalent, so 3 would be primary, and 4 secondary. But according to current guidelines, if a higher grade is present, even if less, it might be considered. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses major+minor=sum. So in this case, the major would be the higher grade if present. Wait, no. The primary is the most common, secondary is the next most common. But if there's a tertiary pattern, it's sometimes noted. However, the user's example uses the two most common. Let me check the example again. The example sentence has "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7", which is 4+3=7, so the primary is 4, secondary 3. So in the current case, the report says "score 7" with 3 architecture 2/3 and 4 architecture 1/3. So the majority is 3, but the highest grade present is 4. Wait, but in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next, but if a higher grade is present, even in a smaller amount, does it affect the score? For example, if the majority is 3 but there's some 4, the score would be 3+4=7. But if the majority is 4 and some 3, it's 4+3=7. The text here says "score 7 yhteensä" and breaks down the components as 3 being 2/3 and 4 being 1/3. So the primary is 3 (since it's 2/3), secondary is 4 (1/3). Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement uses the higher grade first. Wait, the example given by the user was "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So in that case, the primary was 4. But in the current case, the primary is 3 (2/3) and secondary 4 (1/3). So the correct Gleason sum would be 3+4=7. However, the user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Wait, the question states: "huomioon että vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (take into account that only the worst lesion's results should be returned). So if there are multiple lesions, we take the worst one. The text mentions three biopsies with carcinoma foci of lengths 7, 6, and 2mm. The worst would be the largest or highest grade. The report says "score 7" with 3 and 4 architecture. But the breakdown is 2/3 pattern 3 and 1/3 pattern 4. So the primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -tyypin silmukoituvaa rakennetta vajaalta kolmasosalta karsinooman pituudelta." So in some parts, there's Gleason 4. So the worst lesion might have a higher component. But according to the summary, the total score is 7 with 3 being 2/3 and 4 being 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason is 3+4=7.
