Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The input text starts with "Tutkittavana kolme fuusiobiopsiaa prostatan suspektista fokuksesta." The key term here is "fuusiobiopsiaa," which translates to fusion biopsy. Biopsy is one of the allowed values, so Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "karsinoomafokuksia" (carcinoma foci) and "Gleason 4 -tyypin silmukoituvaa rakennetta," which are indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report states "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." This translates to a Gleason score where the major component is 4 (since 4 is higher than 3) and minor is 3. However, the percentages are 2/3 (66.6%) for grade 3 and 1/3 (33.3%) for grade 4. Wait, but Gleason scoring is based on the most predominant (major) and the next most predominant (minor) patterns. Even if grade 4 is less in percentage, if it's the second most common, it would be major 4 and minor 3. But here, the majority is grade 3 (2/3) and grade 4 is 1/3. So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4, making the score 3+4=7. But the text says "score 7," which aligns with 3+4=7. However, sometimes in reports, the order might be mentioned differently. Wait, the example given in the problem statement had 4+3=7. So the user expects the higher grade first. But according to the latest Gleason grading, the primary pattern is the most predominant, and the secondary is the next. So if grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7". However, the text says "score 7," which could be either 3+4 or 4+3. But in the breakdown, 3 is 2/3 and 4 is 1/3, so primary is 3. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". 

But wait, the example in the problem statement had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3." So the order in the text is primary first. In the current case, the text says "tason 3 graduksen kasvua, joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4." So grade 3 is the main, and grade 4 is secondary. Therefore, the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".
