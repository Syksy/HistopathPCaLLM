Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text starts with "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa prostatan suspektista fokuksesta." The word "biopsiaa" is the key here. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, specifically "fuusiobiopsiaa" (fusion biopsy), the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "karsinoomafokuksia" which translates to carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The text has "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." This indicates a Gleason score of 3 and 4. The majority (2/3) is grade 3 and the minor (1/3) is grade 4. So the format should be major + minor = sum. Here, the major is 3 and minor is 4, leading to 3+4=7. Wait, but the order in Gleason is based on the most predominant and then the next. However, in the example given, the user used "4+3=7" when the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order in the example is first the higher grade. Wait, no, in the example, the original text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to grades 4 and 3, so the sum is 4+3=7. But in the current case, the text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So grade 3 is the major (2/3) and grade 4 is minor (1/3). Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (major) is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, sometimes if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might be considered. But according to the user's example, when the text mentions grades 4 and 3, it's written as 4+3=7. So in this case, the major is 3 (since it's 2/3) and minor is 4 (1/3), so the sum would be 3+4=7. However, I need to check if the user's example is based on the order mentioned in the text. In the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which is 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. In the current case, the text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So the primary is 3 (major) and secondary is 4 (minor). Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the user's example uses the order as mentioned in the text. So if the text says "3 ja 4", then it's 3+4. But in the current case, the text mentions "3 arkkitehtuuri" first (2/3) and then "4 arkkitehtuuri" (1/3). So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. However, sometimes in practice, the higher grade is listed first even if it's the minor component. Wait, no, the standard is that the primary (most extensive) pattern is listed first, then the secondary. So if grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then it's 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format here is "3+4=7".

But let me double-check the text. The user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. In the current case, the text says "tason 3 graduksen kasvua, joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4". So the main is 3, and some 4. Then in the summary: "score 7" with 3 architecture 2/3 and 4 architecture 1/3. So the majority is 3, so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Hence, 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".
