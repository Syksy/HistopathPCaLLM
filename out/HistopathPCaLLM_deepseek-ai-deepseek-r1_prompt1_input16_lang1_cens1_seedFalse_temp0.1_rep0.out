Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the original sample is described as "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here refers to the material studied, but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but in this case, there's no such indication. So I might have to default to "NA" for the sample type.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report talks about "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja", which suggests varying differentiation grades. Differentiation grades are typically related to cancer, but the text doesn't explicitly state malignancy. However, the mention of "keski-graden (esim. 3+4 tai 4+3)" refers to Gleason scores, which are indicators of prostate cancer. So even though it's not directly stated as malignant, the presence of Gleason grading implies malignancy. Therefore, malignancy should be "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that scoring is difficult due to resolution issues in digital images. It also says that the exact score couldn't be classified ("tarkan scoren luokittaminen on mahdoonta"). Therefore, even though there's a mention of possible scores, the actual reported Gleason isn't provided. So the Gleason field should be "NA" because they couldn't determine it definitively.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "kyllä" because Gleason scores are discussed, indicating cancer. Gleason is NA because no specific score was assigned in the report.
