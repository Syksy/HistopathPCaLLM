Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Since a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, and the term "preparate" refers to the processed specimen, this indicates the sample type is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," which refers to cancer grading. Additionally, phrases like "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat" and "perineural invasion" are clear indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy is definitely "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to report the major and minor patterns as "major+minor=sum". The statement says the most dominant is grade 4 with some grade 3. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) pattern is listed first, followed by the secondary (minor) pattern. So it should be 4+3=7. The example given in the instructions uses this format, so I'll follow that exactly.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The user specified to take the most severe lesion, which here is the dominant Gleason 4 with grade 3. Also, checking that all values are correctly formatted. No issues there. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
