Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Since a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, and the term "preparate" refers to the processed specimen, this indicates that the sample type is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," which refers to cancerous cells. Additionally, there's mention of "Perineural invasion" and the tumor "infiltrating through the capsule to the fat," both of which are indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy is definitely "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to present it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant. The report states the most dominant is grade 4 and some grade 3. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) grade is the most prevalent, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. So here, major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4," so that's the primary focus. Other areas might have grade 3, but the highest grade (4) is the main contributor. Also, the sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy, so no ambiguity there. The malignancy is confirmed by tumor invasion and perineural involvement. The Gleason score is correctly calculated as 4+3=7. No nested structures in the JSON, just straightforward key-value pairs. Everything checks out.
