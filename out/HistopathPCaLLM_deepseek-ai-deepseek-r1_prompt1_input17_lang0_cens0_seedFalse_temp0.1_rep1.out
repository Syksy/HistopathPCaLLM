Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they're asking for. The task is to extract structured data from a given histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I have to make sure each field adheres to those.

Starting with the first field: Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The provided text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. Since a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, the sample type here would be "RP". So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text states "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat" and mentions "malignant tumor findings" implicitly by discussing Gleason grades and invasion. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to present it as "major+minor=sum". The text says "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". The dominant grade is the major, and the minor is the next. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions multiple foci but specifies the most dominant as grade 4. That's the one to use. Also, check that there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that.

Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatectomy preparate" definitely points to RP. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of tumor infiltration and perineural invasion. Gleason is clearly stated as 4 and 3. All fields fit the allowed values. No part of the answer should be nested, just a straightforward JSON object with the three keys. That should cover everything.

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
