Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to extract are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." so that's a prostatectomy sample. RP is the abbreviation for radical prostatectomy, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and "tumor is clearly infiltrating..." which indicates malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The dominant is grade 4, and some grade 3. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Need to make sure there's no nested structures in JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses quotes around the values, so follow that. Check if any other parts might affect the answer, but the most severe here is Gleason 4+3=7. Perineural invasion and capsule infiltration confirm malignancy but don't affect Gleason scoring here. Seminal vesicles are clear, so no impact. All right, that's covered.
