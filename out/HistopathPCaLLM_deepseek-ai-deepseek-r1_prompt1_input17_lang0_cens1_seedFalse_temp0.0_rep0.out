Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prostate tissue sites" but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The first part talks about prepared samples and processing, but the original sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This seems to be a discussion about assessing whether Gleason grades (which are indicative of cancer) are present. However, the report is preliminary and the actual assessment is pending. There's no definitive statement confirming or denying malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the Gleason grades mentioned are part of a possible assessment (using "between 3 to 5" as a range, not specific grades), there's no actual reported Gleason grade. The report is waiting for further assessment. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no confirmed malignancy or specific Gleason score, all fields remain NA. The example given in the problem shows that if there's a confirmed malignancy with Gleason, it's structured, but here everything is pending. So the final JSON should have all NAs.
