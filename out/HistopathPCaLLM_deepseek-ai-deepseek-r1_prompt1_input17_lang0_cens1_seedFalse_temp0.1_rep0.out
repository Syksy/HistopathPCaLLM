Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the three structured fields from the given text. The user wants the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade.

Looking at the sample type: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample type isn't clearly stated, so I'll put "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text says "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This is a bit ambiguous. It's discussing the possibility of Gleason grades but doesn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer detected, the answer here should be "no" or "NA". But wait, Gleason grades are only for malignant cases. The mention of checking if the material is "fully healthy" suggests they're looking for malignancy. However, the report is preliminary and the assessment is pending. So maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed yet. So "NA" might be safer here.

For Gleason grade: The text mentions "Gleason between 3 to 5" but doesn't give a specific major+minor=sum. Since it's a range and not a specific grade, and the assessment is pending, the Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. But wait, the user said to take the most severe lesion. However, the text doesn't mention any lesions, just that the assessment is pending. So all fields would be NA.

 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
