Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prostate tissue sites" but there's no explicit mention of how they were obtained. The text talks about samples A-D, E-F, etc., which might be from a biopsy or a surgical procedure. However, terms like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP" aren't present. So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions assessing differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's part of a hypothetical scenario for a course session. The report is preliminary, and the actual assessment is pending. There's no definitive statement of malignancy found. So Malignancy should be NA since it's not confirmed yet.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 are being considered, but it's part of an assignment for residents. There's no specific Gleason score reported here. The actual assessment is pending the consensus update. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no confirmed findings, all fields default to NA. The JSON should reflect that with no nested structures.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
