Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prostate tissue sites" but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about prepared samples and processing, but without specific procedure names. So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions assessing differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's part of a teaching scenario for residents. It says "if the material is fully healthy" which suggests uncertainty. There's no definitive statement of malignancy found. So Malignancy should be NA since it's a preliminary report pending further assessment.

Lastly, Gleason. The example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 are being assessed but doesn't report a specific grade. Since it's part of a future assignment and not confirmed, there's no actual Gleason score provided. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. The answer should be a JSON object with those values.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
