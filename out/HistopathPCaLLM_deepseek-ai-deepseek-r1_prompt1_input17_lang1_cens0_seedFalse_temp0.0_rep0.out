Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The sample mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, which is usually RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The report talks about "useampi selkeä fokus" with Gleason grades, and mentions invasion into the capsule and perineural invasion. These are malignant features. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary is 4, secondary is 3. So the format is "4+3=7". 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the basis. The worst here is Gleason 4+3=7. 

Check if all fields are correctly formatted. Sampletype RP, Malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. That fits the example structure. No issues spotted. Ready to output the JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
