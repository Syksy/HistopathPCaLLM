Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the text starts with "Prostatetomiapreparaatti normaalin kaavan mukaan..." which translates to prostatectomy specimen processed in the usual way. So, the sample type here is a prostatectomy, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3, and terms like "kasvain infiltroi" (tumor infiltrates) indicating malignancy. So Malignancy is definitely "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary (major) is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base. The worst here is Gleason 4+3=7. Also, perineural invasion and capsular infiltration are noted but don't affect the Gleason score.

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetomiapreparaatti" is a prostatectomy specimen, so RP is correct. No mention of biopsy or TURP. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is correctly formatted. All fields accounted for. No other structures needed. Looks good.
