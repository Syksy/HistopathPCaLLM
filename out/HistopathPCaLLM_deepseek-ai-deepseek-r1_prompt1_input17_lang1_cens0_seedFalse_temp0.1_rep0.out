Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Ajetaan prostatetomiapreparaatti normaalin kaavan mukaan..." The term "prostatetomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. Prostatectomy typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus, joissa vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4..." The presence of Gleason grades indicates malignancy. Also, terms like "kasvain infiltroi selvästi kapselin läpi rasvaan" (the tumor clearly infiltrates through the capsule into the fat) confirm malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The dominant (major) grade is 4, and minor is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions multiple foci but specifies the dominant grade as 4 with some 3, so that's the primary one. Other areas like apex and seminal vesicles are clean, so they don't affect the Gleason score here.

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetomiapreparaatti" is indeed RP. No mention of biopsy or TURP. Malignancy is confirmed by tumor presence and Gleason. Gleason is correctly formatted. No nested structures, just the three fields. All seems to fit.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
