Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Ajetaan prostatetomiapreparaatti normaalin kaavan mukaan..." The term "prostatetomiapreparaatti" refers to a prostatectomy specimen. In medical terms, a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, which is typically a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be RP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus, joissa vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4..." Gleason grading is only applicable to malignant tumors, so the presence of Gleason 4 and 3 indicates malignancy. Also, terms like "kasvain infiltroi selvästi kapselin läpi rasvaan" (tumor clearly infiltrates through the capsule into fat) confirm malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3." The primary (major) pattern is 4, and the secondary (minor) is 3. The format should be "major+minor=sum". So 4+3=7. 

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions multiple foci, but the dominant is Gleason 4, so that's the one to report. 

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetomiapreparaatti" definitely points to RP. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of carcinoma with Gleason scores and invasion. Gleason sum is correctly 4+3=7. 

Everything seems to fit. No conflicting information in the text. The apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base, which is where the malignancy is noted. Perineural invasion and capsular infiltration further support malignancy.
