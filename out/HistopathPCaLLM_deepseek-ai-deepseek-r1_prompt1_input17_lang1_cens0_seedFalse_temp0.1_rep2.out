Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Ajetaan prostatetomiapreparaatti normaalin kaavan mukaan..." The term "prostatetomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. Prostatectomy usually refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus, joissa vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4..." which indicates the presence of malignant findings (adenocarcinoma with Gleason grading). Also, there's mention of perineural invasion and tumor infiltrating the capsule into fat. So Malignancy is definitely "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary (major) pattern is 4, and the secondary (minor) is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported. The report mentions multiple foci, but the main one is Gleason 4 with some 3, so that's the one to use. Also, the sample type is RP, not a biopsy or TURP. No other sample types are mentioned. The apex and seminal vesicles are clean, but the main findings are in the base, which is part of the prostatectomy specimen.

Double-checking that there are no nested structures in the JSON. All three fields are top-level. The malignancy is confirmed as yes because of the presence of carcinoma. The Gleason score is correctly formatted. Everything seems to fit the required structure.
