Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text report in Finnish, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to prostate biopsy. Wait, no, the example given in the problem had "biopsy" as the sample type when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". But in the current input, the text starts with "Valmistellut näytteet prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti..." which translates to "Prepared samples are processed according to standard routine procedures..." and talks about different parts of the prostate being marked. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example had "biopsy" because the text mentioned "biopsiasta", but here there's no such term. So maybe the sample type here is NA because it's not specified? Or perhaps the mention of "näytteet" (samples) being processed from different parts of the prostate implies a biopsy? Hmm, but without explicit terms like "biopsia", "RP", or "TURP", maybe it's safer to put NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "Useampaa selvästi hyvin valmisteltua prostatan kudoskohdetta havaitaan, joten voidaan todnäk arvioida esim. erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een siten että onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia." This translates to "Several well-prepared prostate tissue samples are observed, so it is likely to assess differentiation degrees for Gleason between 3 to 5, whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal." So they are considering whether there's Gleason grading (which is for cancer), but it's not confirmed. The report mentions that the evaluation is left to specialists in an upcoming session. So there's no definitive statement of malignancy present. The possible Gleason scores are mentioned, but it's part of an assessment that hasn't been concluded yet. Therefore, malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe "ei" (no) or NA. But the presence of Gleason evaluation might suggest that there's suspicion, but the actual determination is pending. Since the report doesn't state malignancy explicitly, and the assessment is pending, perhaps the malignancy field should be NA. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report doesn't confirm any malignancy and says that the evaluation is left for later, then the answer should be "ei" (no) because no malignancy is confirmed, or NA because it's not determined yet. The example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's pending, maybe NA. But the instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or NA. If the sample is being assessed but no conclusion is given, perhaps NA is appropriate. However, the text mentions that they can assess Gleason grades between 3 to 5, which are for cancer. But the presence of Gleason grading would imply malignancy. Wait, but the example had Gleason mentioned and malignancy was "kyllä". However, in this case, the report is talking about assessing whether there's any Gleason present (i.e., cancer) or if it's normal. So it's possible that the samples could be either malignant or benign, but it's not determined yet. Therefore, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so the answer would be NA. Alternatively, if the possibility of Gleason is mentioned, does that imply that malignancy is present? But the text says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" (whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal). So it's uncertain. Therefore, the malignancy field should be NA because it's not confirmed.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, and the Gleason is mentioned as a range (3 to 5) but no specific score is given, the Gleason field should be NA. The example had a specific score, but here there's no sum provided. The text says "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which means differentiation degrees for Gleason between 3 to 5. But no specific major and minor components are given. So the Gleason is not reported yet, hence NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified (biopsy, RP, TURP not mentioned). Malignancy is NA because it's pending assessment. Gleason is NA because no specific score is given.
