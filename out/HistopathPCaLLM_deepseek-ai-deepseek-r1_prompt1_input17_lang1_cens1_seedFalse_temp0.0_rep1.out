Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The example given helps, so I need to follow that structure.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to prostate biopsy, hence "biopsy". In the current case, the text starts with "Valmistellut näytteet prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti..." which translates to prepared samples processed according to standard routine procedures. It talks about different parts of the prostate (right and left sides) and various samples labeled A-O. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which translates to differentiation degrees for Gleason between 3 to 5. Gleason scores are only relevant for malignant cases. However, the text also says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" which means whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal. The report is preliminary and leaves the assessment to specialists in an upcoming session. There's no definitive statement of malignancy found. So, since it's uncertain and pending further evaluation, Malignancy should be "NA".

Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since Malignancy is "NA" here, and there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason should also be "NA". Even though they mention Gleason grades between 3 to 5, it's part of a pending assessment, not a reported result. The example only includes Gleason when malignancy is confirmed.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed yet, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
