Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through the requirements again to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to "prostate biopsy", so that's why the sample type was "biopsy" there. In the current case, the text starts with "Valmistellut näytteet prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti..." which translates to "Prepared samples are processed according to standard routine procedures..." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about different sections of the prostate (right and left sides, samples A-N, etc.), but it doesn't specify the origin. So I think the sample type here is "NA" because it's not explicitly stated.

Next, the malignancy field: whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The example had adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". In the current text, they mention assessing differentiation grades for Gleason from 3 to 5, but it's phrased as "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" which translates to "whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal." This suggests that the presence of malignancy is uncertain here. The report is preliminary and mentions that the evaluation will be done in a future session. Since there's no definitive statement of malignancy, maybe the answer here is "NA". But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the report is discussing Gleason grades (which are for cancer), does that imply malignancy? But the text says "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which means differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 to 5. However, the presence of Gleason grading typically indicates cancer. But the text is talking about an assessment that's yet to be done. The current report doesn't confirm malignancy; it's left for specialists to evaluate next week. So the malignancy isn't confirmed here. Therefore, the answer might be "NA" because it's not determined yet.

Third, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the report is preliminary without a specific Gleason score provided, the Gleason field should be "NA". The text mentions that the assessment of Gleason grades is pending, so there's no actual score reported yet.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed. Gleason is NA because no score is given. The example had all fields filled because the data was present, but here the data is pending. So the JSON should reflect that with NAs where information isn't available.
