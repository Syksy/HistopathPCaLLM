Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to prostate biopsy. But in the current case, the text provided doesn't explicitly mention the sample type. It talks about "Valmistellut näytteet" (prepared samples) and mentions different parts of the prostate being processed. However, there's no clear indication if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or something else. Since the sample type isn't specified, I should go with NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions that there are "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which translates to differentiation degrees for Gleason between 3 and 5. Gleason grading is used for cancer, so the presence of Gleason scores suggests malignancy. However, the text also says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" (whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal). This part is a bit ambiguous. It seems like they are evaluating whether there's any malignancy (Gleason present) or if it's normal. Since the report is preliminary and the final assessment is left for specialists next week, there's no definitive conclusion here. So, the malignancy isn't confirmed yet. Therefore, the answer might be NA, but I need to check if the mention of Gleason scores between 3-5 implies malignancy. However, the text says "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille" which refers to differentiation grades, which are part of Gleason scoring for cancer. So even though it's not confirmed, the presence of Gleason evaluation suggests that malignancy is being considered. But the actual answer requires whether malignant findings were present in the sample. Since the report doesn't confirm it and leaves it for further assessment, maybe the answer here is NA. Alternatively, if the mention of Gleason implies that malignancy is present, but the example given in the instructions shows that when Gleason is mentioned, malignancy is "kyllä". But in this case, the Gleason is not confirmed, just that they are evaluating between 3-5. So maybe the answer is NA for malignancy as well.

Third, Gleason. The format should be "major+minor=sum" or NA. The text mentions that differentiation degrees are between 3 and 5, but no specific scores are given. The example had specific numbers, but here it's a range. Since there's no exact Gleason score reported (like 4+3=7), and it's just a range mentioned for evaluation purposes, the Gleason field should be NA. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's results, but if there's no specific score, then NA is appropriate.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed yet, just under evaluation. Gleason is NA because no specific score is given.
