Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to prostate biopsy. However, in the current case, the text says "Valmistellut näytteet prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti..." which translates to prepared samples processed according to standard routine procedures. The terms used here are "näytteet A-D", "E-F", "G-N", etc., which refer to samples but don't specify the type. The original example had "biopsy" because it was explicitly mentioned, but here there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified, so it should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions assessing differentiation grades for Gleason from 3 to 5, asking whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal. The phrase "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" translates to "whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal." Since they are considering the presence of Gleason grades (which are for cancer), but the report doesn't confirm malignancy, just that they need to assess it. So there's no explicit statement of malignancy found. Therefore, malignancy would be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA". Wait, but the options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions the need to assess it, perhaps it's not determined yet. However, the user instruction says to report only the worst lesion's results. If there's no mention of malignancy, maybe "ei" or "NA". But the example had "kyllä" when Gleason was present. Here, since Gleason is being considered (grades 3-5), but not confirmed, maybe the malignancy is still uncertain. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the report says they need to assess whether there's any presence (implying it's not confirmed), then malignancy would be "ei" or "NA". Since the example used "kyllä" when Gleason was present, but here Gleason is not confirmed, just that they need to evaluate. So maybe "NA" is safer here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which means differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 to 5. But it's stated as a range and that they need to assess whether they are present at all. Since no specific Gleason score is given (like 3+4=7), and it's just a possible range, the Gleason here isn't reported yet. So the answer should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, just under evaluation. Gleason is NA because no specific score is given.
