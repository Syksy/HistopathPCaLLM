Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the report mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to "prostate biopsy". However, in the current case, the text given is in Finnish. The input text here says "Valmistellut näytteet prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti..." which translates to "Prepared samples are processed according to standard routine procedures..." There's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about samples A-D, E-F, G-N, etc., but doesn't specify the origin. So the sample type isn't clearly stated here. Therefore, the answer for Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "erilaistumisasteet Gleasonille välille 3:sta 5:een" which translates to "differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 to 5". Gleason scores are only relevant if there's malignancy. However, the report states that the evaluation (whether there's any presence of malignancy or if the material is completely normal) is left to specialists in an upcoming course session. So the current report doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the Gleason scores are mentioned as a range (3 to 5) but not specific values for a lesion, there's no definitive Gleason sum provided. The text says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä" (whether they are present at all), indicating uncertainty. Thus, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, none of the fields can be definitively determined from the given text. All three should be "NA".
