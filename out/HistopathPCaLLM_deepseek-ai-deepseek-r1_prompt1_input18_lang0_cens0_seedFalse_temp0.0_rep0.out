Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the three structured fields from the given text. The original sample type: the text mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves removing tissue chips via a shaving method, so the sample type here is likely "TURP."

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason sum 7" and mentions the larger fraction is stage 3 (which is Gleason grade 3) but wait, the sum is 7. If the larger fraction is 3, then the major grade is 3 and the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the description says "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60%." Wait, stage 3 here might be referring to the grade. If the major component is grade 3 (60%) and minor is grade 4 (40%), then the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the way it's written says "the larger fraction with stage 3" which is 60% of the tumor area. So major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the sum is 7, that's the key part. The example given uses "4+3=7" but in this case, it's 3+4=7. The order matters for the grade group, but the user just wants major+minor=sum as the format. So "3+4=7" is correct here.
