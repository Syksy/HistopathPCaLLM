Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the necessary information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure". I recall that TURP is a procedure where tissue is shaved from the prostate, so "TURP" seems likely here. The term "chippings" is often associated with TURP samples. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text states "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma". Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason sum 7" and mentions the larger fraction is stage 3 (which is Gleason grade 3) representing 60% of the tumor area. Wait, but if the larger fraction is grade 3, that would be the major component, and the minor would be grade 4 (since 3+4=7). But the text says "the larger fraction with stage 3". Wait, stage 3 here might refer to Gleason grade 3. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But I need to confirm. The statement says "Gleason sum 7" and the larger fraction is grade 3. So major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses "4+3=7" which is different, but here the major is 3. But wait, wait, in Gleason scoring, the first number is the primary (most prevalent) pattern, and the second is the secondary. So if the larger fraction is grade 3 (60%), then primary is 3, secondary is 4 (since 3+4=7). So the correct notation is "3+4=7". 

Yes, that's correct. So the JSON should reflect that.
