Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the three structured fields from the given text. The original sample type: the text mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves removing tissue chips via a shaving method, so the sample type here is likely "TURP."

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason sum 7" and mentions the larger fraction is stage 3 (which is Gleason grade 3) but wait, the user wants major + minor = sum. Wait, the larger fraction is grade 3? Wait, no. Wait, the user example had "4+3=7" where 4 is major and 3 is minor. But in the given text, it says "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Wait, stage 3 here might be referring to Gleason grade 3. But if the larger fraction (major) is grade 3 and the minor would be grade 4? Because the sum is 7. So 3+4=7. But the text says "Gleason sum 7" with the larger fraction being grade 3. So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user example had "4+3=7" which is major 4, minor 3. So in this case, the larger fraction (60%) is grade 3, so that's the major component. Then the minor would be 4, adding up to 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together: sampletype is TURP, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7.
