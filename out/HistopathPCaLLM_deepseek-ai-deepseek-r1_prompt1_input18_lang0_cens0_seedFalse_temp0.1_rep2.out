Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure." I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves removing tissue chips via a shaving method. Biopsy is usually needle cores, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the whole gland. Since it's chippings from a shaving procedure, that points to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The statement says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma indicates malignancy, so the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason, the text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60%." Wait, stage 3 here might be a typo. Gleason grades are patterns 3, 4, 5. The larger fraction (major) is 3, but that's 60% of the tumor area. Wait, but if the sum is 7, major + minor = 7. If the major is 3, then minor would be 4 (3+4=7). But the text says "the larger fraction with stage 3" – maybe "stage" here refers to the grade. So major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". However, the way it's written: "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." So the major component is grade 3 (60%), minor grade 4 (40%), leading to 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's only one carcinoma mentioned with Gleason 7, that's the one to report. The answer should be in the format "major+minor=sum". So the JSON should have "3+4=7" for Gleason.

Double-checking all fields: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. That seems correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
