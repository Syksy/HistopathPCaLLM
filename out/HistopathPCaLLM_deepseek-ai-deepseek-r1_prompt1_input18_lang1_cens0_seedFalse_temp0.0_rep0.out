Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The term "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shavings" or "from chips", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). TURP samples are often referred to as chips or shavings. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "karsinoomaa", which is carcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The report states: "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60% of the tumor). But Gleason scoring is based on the two most prevalent patterns. If the major is 3 and the minor is 4 (since 3+4=7), even though 3 is the majority (60%), the major component is the higher grade. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is determined by the most common grade followed by the next most common, regardless of their proportions. However, in current practices, if the higher grade is more than 5% but less than 50%, it's considered the minor component. But here, the major component is 3 (60%), so the primary pattern is 3, and the secondary is 4 (since 3+4=7). So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60%". So the larger portion (major) is grade 3, and the minor would be grade 4, adding up to 7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's from höyläys, which is TURP)
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The example given uses "4+3=7" when the major was 4. In this case, the major is 3, but the sum is still 3+4=7. The order matters for the Gleason score, but the sum is correct. The user's example had 4+3=7, but here it's 3+4=7. However, the sum is the same, and the format is correct as "major+minor=sum". Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is reported as the primary pattern (most extensive) plus the secondary pattern (second most extensive). So if the primary is grade 3 (60%) and secondary is grade 4 (40%), the score is 3+4=7. So the correct notation is "3+4=7".

Yes, that's right. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
