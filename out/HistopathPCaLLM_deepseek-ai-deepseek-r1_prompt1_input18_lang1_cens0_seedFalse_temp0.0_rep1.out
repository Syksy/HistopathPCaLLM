Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The term "höyläys" in Finnish refers to a procedure, and "lastuja" means chips or fragments. In medical context, "höyläys" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major (larger portion) being grade 3. But Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the sum is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the text mentions that the larger portion (suuremman osuuden) is grade 3, which is 60% of the tumor. So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4, making the sum 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. So the order is primary + secondary. In this case, since the major is 3 (60%), but the sum is 7, that would mean 3+4=7. But the way it's written in the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3", which translates to the larger portion is grade 3. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure that the text isn't indicating something else. The user's example had "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So the order is primary (major) first, then minor. So in this case, the major is 3, but the sum is 7. That would mean 3 + 4 =7, so the Gleason is "3+4=7". Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since höyläys refers to TURP)
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
