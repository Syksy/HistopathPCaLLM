Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja..." The word "höyläys" in Finnish might refer to a procedure. TURP is a common procedure where tissue is shaved off, so "höyläys" here likely corresponds to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "karsinoomaa", which is carcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, Gleason score is primary + secondary = sum. Here, the sum is 7, with the major (primary) being grade 3? But if the sum is 7, the primary and secondary grades should add up to 7. However, the text says the major part is grade 3 (60%), which would mean the secondary is grade 4 (since 3+4=7). But the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. The user's example uses "major+minor=sum", so in this case, it should be 3+4=7. But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3", which translates to the larger portion being grade 3. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example given in the problem shows "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So the order is primary (major) first, then secondary (minor). Here, the major is 3, but that would make the sum 3+4=7. But the user's example has the higher grade first. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. But in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most predominant grade, and the secondary is the next. However, if two grades are present, the higher grade is sometimes listed first if it's more significant. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, even if it's a lower grade. For example, if the majority is grade 3 and a smaller part is grade 4, it's 3+4=7. If the majority is grade 4 and minor is 3, it's 4+3=7. So in this case, since the major portion (60%) is grade 3, then the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (from "höyläys" = TURP)
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
