Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shavings" or "from planing," which makes me think of TURP, as that procedure involves cutting or shaving off tissue from the prostate. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total sum is 7, with the major component (suuremman osuuden) being grade 3. But Gleason scores are based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the sum is 7, and the major component is 3, then the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the text says the major is grade 3 (60% of the tumor), which would make it 3+4=7. But the user example shows "4+3=7" when the major is 4. So here, since the major is 3, it should be 3+4=7. But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which translates to the major grade being 3. So the correct Gleason format is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user example had "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So the structure is major + minor = sum. Here, major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct entry is "3+4=7".

Therefore, the JSON should be:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The carcinoma is present, so malignancy is yes. The sample type is TURP based on the procedure described. Gleason is correctly formatted as major+minor=sum.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
