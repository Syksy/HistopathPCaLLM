Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja", which translates to shavings or chips obtained from a procedure. The term "höyläys" might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a common procedure where tissue is shaved off. So Sampletype should be "TURP". The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. TURP fits here.

Next, malignancy. The report states "pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa" which means carcinoma was found in a small part. So malignancy is present. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. So "kyllä" here.

Third, Gleason score. The text says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista". Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total sum is 7, with the major component (larger portion) being grade 3. But Gleason scoring is major + minor = sum. If the major is 3 and minor is 4, sum is 7. But the way it's phrased here says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major grade is 3, and the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text said major 4 and minor 3. So the order matters. In this case, the major is 3 (since it's the larger portion, 60%), but that doesn't make sense because Gleason's major pattern is the higher grade. Wait, no. Wait, Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). But if the major is grade 3 and minor is grade 4, that would be 3+4=7. However, typically, the higher grade is considered the major even if it's less in quantity. Wait, no. The Gleason score is based on the two most prevalent patterns, with the first number being the predominant (most extensive) pattern, and the second being the next most extensive, even if it's a higher grade. Wait, no, actually, in current grading, if there's a higher grade pattern present, even if it's less extensive, it might be considered. Wait, I might be getting confused here. Let me recall: The Gleason score is the sum of the most common pattern and the highest grade pattern. Wait, no. The standard is that for Gleason scoring in biopsies, it's the most common grade (major) and the second most common (minor), but if there's a tertiary pattern (third), that's handled differently. However, in this case, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the larger portion is grade 3, and the sum is 7. So 3 + 4 =7. Therefore, the major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. But wait, in some cases, if a higher grade is present, even if less, it might be considered. But according to the text, the major portion is grade 3 (60% of the tumor), so the minor would be 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP

Malignancy: kyllä

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested structures and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when the major was 4 and minor 3. So the order is major + minor. In this case, the major is 3 (60% of the tumor), but wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns. However, if the secondary pattern is of a higher grade than the primary, does that affect the order? No, the primary is the most extensive, even if it's a lower grade. Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the old and new systems. In the current system, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. The sum is primary + secondary. So if the primary is 3 (most extensive) and secondary is 4 (next most extensive), then it's 3+4=7. But in some cases, if there's a higher grade pattern that's less extensive, but still present, it might be considered. But according to the text here, the neoplastic part has Gleason sum 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60% of the tumor). So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7".
