Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The term "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shavings" or "from chips", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). TURP samples are often referred to as chips or shavings. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "karsinoomaa", which is carcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60%). But Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the sum is 7, and the major (primary) is 3, then the minor (secondary) would be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which translates to "the larger portion's grade 3". But that would mean primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making 3+4=7. But the user example had "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So here, if the major is 3, but the sum is 7, that would imply 3+4=7. Wait, but 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are both possible, with the first number being the primary (major) pattern. However, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3", meaning the larger portion is grade 3. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the example given in the problem statement had "4+3=7" when the primary was 4. So the format is major + minor = sum. So in this case, major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure that the text is correctly interpreted. The sentence says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." So the sum is 7, and the larger portion (major) is grade 3 (60% of the tumor). The remaining 40% would then be grade 4, since 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (from "höyläyksestä lastuja")
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to check if there's any possibility of misunderstanding. For example, could "höyläys" refer to a biopsy? Probably not. TURP is a procedure where chips are obtained, so "höyläys" here is TURP. Biopsy would be "biopsia" in Finnish. So Sampletype is correctly TURP.

Malignancy is definitely "kyllä" because carcinoma is mentioned.

Gleason sum is 7, major grade 3, minor grade 4. So the format is correct.
