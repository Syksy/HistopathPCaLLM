Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytemateriaali, joka on saatu standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä..." The phrase "standardien eturauhasproseduurien" translates to standard prostate procedures. However, the exact type isn't specified. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. So maybe the sampletype is NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "pieni osa vaatii tarkempaa tutkimusta (alle 5%)" and "saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa". ISUP GG 1 refers to Grade Group 1, which is a malignant finding. However, it's noted that the suspicious focus is too small for reliable grading. The majority (over 95%) is benign. Since there's a suspicion of malignancy (GG1 or higher) even if uncertain, the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes). But wait, the presence of ISUP GG1 is a malignant finding, but the report says it's suspected but too small. Does that count as malignant? The question is whether there are malignant findings. If they mention possible GG1, even if uncertain, it's still indicating possible malignancy. So "kyllä".

For Gleason, the report mentions ISUP GG1. ISUP Grade Group 1 corresponds to Gleason 3+3=6. However, the text says "saattaa sisältää pienen osan ISUP GG 1:tä tai korkeampaa" but it's too small to grade reliably. Since they can't reliably determine the grade, should Gleason be NA? The instructions say to report the Gleason for malignant cases. But if the grade can't be determined due to small size, even if malignancy is present, maybe Gleason is NA here. Wait, the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when it's confirmed. Here, the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, and the grade can't be reliably determined. So the Gleason would be NA because they can't assign a grade. But the user's third point says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa... ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." Since the malignancy is "kyllä", but the Gleason isn't reliably determined, should we put NA here? The example had a confirmed Gleason. Here, even though malignancy is present (suspected), the Gleason isn't reported because it's too small. So the answer would be NA for Gleason.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified beyond standard prostate procedures)
Malignancy: kyllä (due to suspected ISUP GG1 or higher)
Gleason: NA (because the grade couldn't be reliably determined)
