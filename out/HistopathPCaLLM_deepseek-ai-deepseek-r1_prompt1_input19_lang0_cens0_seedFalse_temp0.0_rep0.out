Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions in sample 4 that the whole cylinder contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The report states that in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most predominant pattern as the primary grade and the next most predominant as the secondary. However, if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, that might be considered. Wait, no, the Gleason score is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive). But in cases where a higher grade is present but less extensive, does that affect the primary? Let me think. For example, if there's a small amount of pattern 4 but the majority is pattern 3, the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making 3+4=7. But in the given text, it says "larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. 

Wait, but the user example had 4+3=7. So the order matters based on the majority. The primary is the most common, even if a higher grade is present. So in this case, since 90% is Gleason 3 and 10% is Gleason 4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. 

So the structured JSON should have Gleason as "3+4=7". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, that's the most severe. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative. 

Double-checking the report: Yes, sample 4 has adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 and 4. No mention of higher grades elsewhere. Capsule breach or perineural invasion isn't present, but that doesn't affect the Gleason score. 

So the final JSON should be as specified.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
