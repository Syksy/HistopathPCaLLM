Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text starts with "targeted prostate biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions adenocarcinoma in sample 4, which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." In the text, sample 4 has Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. Wait, no—wait, Gleason grading is based on the most predominant pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). But if there are two patterns, the higher grade is listed first if they are different. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. So in this case, 90% is Gleason 3 and 10% is Gleason 4. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. But according to current guidelines, the Gleason score is the sum of the most common and the highest grade present. Wait, no—I think I might be mixing up the rules. Let me recall: For Gleason scoring in biopsies, if there are two patterns, the primary (most extensive) and the secondary (second most extensive). If the secondary is a higher grade than the primary, does that affect the score? Wait, no. The Gleason score is primary + secondary, regardless of which is higher. Wait, but in some cases, if there's a tertiary pattern, that's handled differently. But here, it's two patterns: 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the score would be 3+4=7. But the user example had 4+3=7, which is different. So the order matters based on the primary and secondary. In this case, since the majority is Gleason 3 (90%), that's the primary, and the 10% is Gleason 4 as secondary. So the correct Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the text says "the larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So larger portion is Gleason 3, which is primary, and smaller is Gleason 4, secondary. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes in reports, if the higher grade is present even in a smaller portion, does that affect the primary? No, the primary is the most extensive. So in this case, primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy

Malignancy: yes

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the JSON is correctly formatted, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, and it's the most severe, that's the one to report.
