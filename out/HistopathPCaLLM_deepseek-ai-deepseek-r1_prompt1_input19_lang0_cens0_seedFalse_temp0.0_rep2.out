Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text starts with "targeted prostate biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions adenocarcinoma in sample 4, which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." In sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, Gleason grading considers the most predominant pattern as the primary and the next most as secondary. However, if one is higher grade, even if less in quantity, it might affect the score. Wait, no—the primary is the most common, and secondary is the next most common, but if there's a higher grade even in a smaller amount, that's the secondary. Wait, actually, the current Gleason system (Grade Groups) considers the primary as the most prevalent pattern and the secondary as the next highest grade, even if it's less. So in this case, the largest portion is Gleason 3 (90%), and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason sum would be 3+4=7. The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4 and minor 3, but in this case, it's 3 and 4. So the correct format here should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" where the major was 4 and minor 3, but the order here is 3 (major) and 4 (minor). So the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy

Malignancy: yes

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, and the Gleason there is 3+4=7, that's the one to report. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative, so they don't affect the result. The answer should be in JSON without nested structures. Let me double-check the allowed values for each field. Sampletype is correct as biopsy. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is in the correct format. Alright, that should be it.
