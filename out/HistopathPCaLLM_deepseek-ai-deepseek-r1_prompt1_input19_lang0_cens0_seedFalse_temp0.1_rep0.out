Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". In sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, does that affect the primary? Wait, no. Wait, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) considers the primary as the most common pattern and the secondary as the next highest grade, even if it's less in quantity. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern is the most predominant, and the secondary is the second most predominant. But in cases where a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, does that change the primary? For example, if there's 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so sum is 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7, which would be primary 4, secondary 3. So in this case, since the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is 4 (10%), the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. 

Wait, but the user's example had "4 and 3" resulting in 4+3=7. So the order is based on the grades, not the quantity. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern. If the majority is grade 3 (90%) and a smaller part is grade 4 (10%), then the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the correct format here would be "3+4=7". 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure that the answer follows the example's format exactly. The text specifies that only the most severe lesion should be considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, that's the one to report.
