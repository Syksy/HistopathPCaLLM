Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". In sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. However, if one pattern is higher grade but less prevalent, the primary is still the higher grade. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern, even if a higher grade is present in a smaller amount. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. But if there's a higher grade even in a smaller amount, does that affect the primary? Wait, no. The primary is the most common pattern. For example, if there's 90% grade 3 and 10% grade 4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so Gleason score 3+4=7. But in the example given in the problem statement, the user had 4+3=7, which would be if the primary was 4 and secondary 3. So in this case, since the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%), that's the primary, and the smaller part is 4 (10%), so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. 

Wait, but the user's example had "4 and 3" resulting in 4+3=7, but in reality, the primary is the higher grade if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less? No, no, the primary is the most extensive pattern. So if the majority is 3 and a smaller part is 4, it's 3+4=7. If the majority is 4 and a smaller is 3, it's 4+3=7. So in the given text, sample 4 has 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. Therefore, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. 

But the user's example had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So perhaps the order is based on the order mentioned in the text. Wait, in the example statement, it says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so they wrote 4+3. But in reality, the primary is the most extensive. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the user expects that the order in the text is followed. Wait, the user's example says "grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So perhaps the order in the text is taken as primary and secondary. But in reality, the primary is the most extensive. However, in the given problem's text, it says "larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So the larger portion is Gleason 3, which would be primary, and the smaller is 4. So the correct Gleason score should be 3+4=7. 

Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".
