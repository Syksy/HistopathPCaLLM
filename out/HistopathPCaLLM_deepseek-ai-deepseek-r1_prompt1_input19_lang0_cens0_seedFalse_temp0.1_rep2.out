Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given medical text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the first question: Sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example format is major+minor=sum. The text specifies that in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most common pattern as the primary grade and the next highest as the secondary, not necessarily the largest area. However, in practice, sometimes the largest area is considered the primary. But according to the latest guidelines, the primary grade is the most predominant, and the secondary is the next highest, even if it's a smaller percentage. Here, the largest portion is Gleason 3 (90%), but the secondary is Gleason 4 (10%). However, since Gleason 4 is a higher grade than 3, the primary should be the higher grade. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. But if there's a higher grade present, even in a smaller amount, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the highest remaining. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (highest remaining) grade. So in this case, the most extensive is Gleason 3 (90%), and the highest remaining is Gleason 4 (10%). Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But the text says "the larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So primary is 3 (most extensive), secondary is 4 (next highest), so sum is 3+4=7. But the user example had 4+3=7, which is different. Wait, the example in the instructions was 4+3=7, which sums to 7. So in this case, the user's example uses the higher grade first if it's the major component. Wait, no, the example in the instructions says "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So the primary is 4, secondary 3. But in the current case, the primary is 3 (90%) and secondary is 4 (10%). So the correct Gleason should be 3+4=7. However, according to current medical guidelines, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next highest. So even if the secondary is a higher grade but less in quantity, the primary is still the most extensive. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (primary) and the highest remaining grade (secondary). Wait, no, actually, the current grading system (since 2016) for prostate cancer uses the Grade Groups, but the Gleason score is still reported as the sum of the primary and secondary patterns. The primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if there's a tertiary pattern of higher grade, that's noted separately. But in this case, the text mentions only two patterns: Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, leading to 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". 

Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order is primary first, then secondary. So in the current case, primary is 3 (most extensive), secondary is 4 (next highest), so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "targeted prostate biopsies")

Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)

Gleason: "3+4=7"

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I should double-check the text again. The samples are biopsies. Sample 4 has adenocarcinoma. The Gleason components are 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). So yes, the answer is correct.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
