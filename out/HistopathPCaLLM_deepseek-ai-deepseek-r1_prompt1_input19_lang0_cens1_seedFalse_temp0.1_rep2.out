Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the raw data, the text mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." But it doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The samples are referred to as samples 1-4, which might be biopsies, but it's not clear. So Sampletype would be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says sample 4 has tissue that "may differ from normal" and mentions "possibly malignant." However, it's uncertain, and they need to verify if there's a lab mishap. Since it's not confirmed, the malignancy isn't definitively present. So Malignancy should be NA because it's uncertain, not a clear yes or no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. The focus is on uncertainty about malignancy, not grading. So Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. The most severe lesion mentioned is in sample 4, but it's not confirmed as malignant, so all fields default to NA.
