Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: the first line mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies, so the sample type here is definitely biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states that in sample 4, there's adenokarsinoomaa, which is adenocarcinoma, a malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Since Gleason 4 is the minor component (10%) and Gleason 3 is the major (90%), the sum would be 3+4=7. Wait, but the standard Gleason grading takes the primary (most predominant) and secondary (next most predominant) patterns. However, in the example given in the problem statement, the user had a case where the major was 4 and minor 3, leading to 4+3=7. But here, the major is Gleason 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%). So the correct Gleason score should be 3+4=7. However, the problem says to report the worst lesion's results. Wait, but in the example, they took the major and minor from the same lesion. In the given case here, sample 4 has adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order is primary + secondary. So in this case, since 3 is the major (90%) and 4 is minor (10%), the correct format is 3+4=7. So the answer is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested structures and only includes the worst lesion. Since sample 4 is the one with malignancy, and the others are benign or non-representative, we take the Gleason from sample 4. The answer should be correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
