Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line says "Näytteinä kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat eri puolilta tyyppilokaatioita." The word "prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions in sample 4: "näytteessä 4 nähdään... adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So there's a malignancy present. The answer here should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text states that in sample 4, the larger part is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. However, if the highest grade is present, even if it's less than 5%, it's included. But in this case, the major part is 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%). So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The order here is important. The primary pattern is the most common, which is 3, and the secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. The report also mentions "Gleason 3" and "Gleason 4", so combining them as 3+4=7 is correct.

Wait, but sometimes there's confusion between primary and secondary. The major component is the higher grade, but in this case, the higher grade is 4, but it's the minor component. However, according to Gleason scoring rules, the primary grade is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, even if the secondary is a higher grade. Wait, no, actually, the primary is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the second most prevalent. But if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less than 5%, it's considered. But in this case, the major part is 90% Gleason 3, and minor 10% Gleason 4. So the correct Gleason score is 3+4=7. The order is primary (most common) first, then secondary. So the sum is 3+4=7. The text says "isompi osuus... Gleason 3" and "pienempi osuus... Gleason 4", so the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. The other samples (1-3) are either non-representative or benign, but the instruction says to take the worst lesion, which is sample 4. So the JSON should reflect that.
