Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example used "biopsy" because the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current case, the text starts with "Näytteinä kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat..." which translates to "Targeted prostate biopsies as samples...". So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The example had "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma was found. In the given text, it mentions "Näytteessä 4 nähdään... adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma is present in sample 4. Even though samples 2 and 3 are healthy, sample 4 is malignant. The question asks if there were malignant findings in the sample, and since at least one sample (sample 4) is malignant, the answer here should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The example had 4+3=7. In the current text, for sample 4, it states "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. However, in the text, Gleason 3 is 90% and Gleason 4 is 10%. So the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7, which is different. Wait, the example had the higher grade first. But according to Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (most extensive) is listed first, then the secondary. So if the major is 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%), it's 3+4=7. However, sometimes in reports, the higher grade might be considered the major even if it's less in percentage. Wait, no, the standard is that the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next, regardless of grade. But in some cases, if there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is taken as the secondary if it's less than 5%? Wait, no. The Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and the secondary (second most extensive) patterns. If there are only two patterns, the most extensive is primary, the next is secondary. So in this case, 90% is Gleason 3 and 10% is Gleason 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 3+4=7. But the example had 4+3=7, which would be if the primary was 4 and secondary 3. So in this case, the correct Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the text says "isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)". So the larger portion is Gleason 3, smaller is 4. Therefore, the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So in that case, the order was 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. So perhaps in the current case, the order is 3 and 4, leading to 3+4=7. So the answer here is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure that the major and minor are correctly identified. The major is the most prevalent, which is 3 (90%), and minor is 4 (10%). So yes, 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
