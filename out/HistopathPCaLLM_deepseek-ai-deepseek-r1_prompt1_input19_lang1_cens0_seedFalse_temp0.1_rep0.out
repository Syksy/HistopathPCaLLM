Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies, so the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 4, there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So there are malignant findings. Therefore, Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Since the major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. However, in cases where the highest grade is present, even if it's a smaller percentage, it might be considered the secondary. Wait, no—the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. But in the example given in the problem statement, they took the higher grade as major even if it's the minor component. Wait, no, the example was "4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So in the example, the first number is the primary (major) pattern, and the second is the secondary (minor). But in the current case, the report says "isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)". So the major component is Gleason 3 (90%), and minor is Gleason 4 (10%). Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. Wait, but the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". So we need to take the worst lesion's results. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, and in that sample, the Gleason is 3 (major) and 4 (minor), the sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but in the example given by the user, the order was 4+3=7. That's because the major was 4 and minor 3. So in our case, the major is 3 (90%) and minor 4 (10%), so it's 3+4=7. But sometimes, the Gleason score is reported as the higher grade first if there's a tertiary pattern, but according to standard practice, the primary pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next, regardless of their grades. However, in some cases, if the highest grade is present even in a small amount, it might be considered. Wait, no—the standard Gleason score is primary (most extensive) + secondary (second most extensive). So in this case, primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%), so the score is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and that only the worst lesion (sample 4 here) is considered. The other samples (1-3) are either non-representative or benign, so they don't affect the malignancy or Gleason score. The answer should only reflect the malignant sample's details.
