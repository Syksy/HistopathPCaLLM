Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the example, "Prostata biopsiasta" translates to biopsy, so the sampletype was "biopsy". In the current case, the text starts with "Näytteinä kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat..." which means the samples are targeted prostate biopsies. So the sampletype here should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The example had adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". In the current text, for sample 4, they mention "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. The example had 4+3=7. In the given text, sample 4 has Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading is based on the most predominant pattern (major) and the next most predominant (minor). However, if one is higher grade, even if it's a smaller percentage, it becomes the major. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns. So if the majority is Gleason 3 (90%) and a smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%), then the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason sum would be 3+4=7. But the text says "isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)". So the major is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. But the user wants the format as major+minor=sum. So the correct entry should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the higher grade is considered the major even if it's a smaller percentage. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most extensive, regardless of grade. However, if there are two patterns where one is higher grade but less extensive, the primary is the most extensive. For example, if 60% is pattern 3 and 40% is pattern 4, then it's 3+4=7. But if 40% is pattern 4 and 60% is pattern 3, it's still 3+4=7. Wait, no. Wait, the primary is the most common, even if lower grade. So in this case, 90% is Gleason 3 (primary) and 10% is Gleason 4 (secondary). So the Gleason score is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct entry is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
