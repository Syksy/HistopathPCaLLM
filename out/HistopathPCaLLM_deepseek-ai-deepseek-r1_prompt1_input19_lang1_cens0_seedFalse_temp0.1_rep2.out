Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example used "biopsy" because the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current case, the text starts with "Näytteinä kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat..." which translates to "Targeted prostate biopsies as samples...". So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The example had "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma was found. In the given text, for sample 4, it mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. The other samples (2 and 3) are healthy, but since at least one sample (4) is malignant, the overall malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The example had 4+3=7. In the current text, sample 4 has Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading is based on the most common and the highest pattern. Wait, no—Gleason score is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive, even if less than 5%). But in cases where there are only two patterns, the primary is the higher grade if they are different? Wait, no. Wait, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if there are two patterns, the primary is the one with the higher grade only if it's more extensive. Wait, no. Let me recall: the Gleason score is determined by the most prevalent pattern (primary) and the second most prevalent (secondary), regardless of which is higher. But in cases where there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is considered if it's a tertiary component. But in this case, the text says "isompi osuus Gleason 3 (90%)" and "pienempi osuus Gleason 4 (10%)". So the primary is 3 (since it's 90%), secondary is 4 (10%). Therefore, the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. Wait, but the user's example had 4+3=7 when the major was 4 and minor 3. So in this case, since the major is 3 and minor 4, it should be 3+4=7. But wait, the way the user wants it is "major+minor=sum", where major is the higher grade. Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if the secondary is a higher grade than the primary, does that affect the order? No. The primary is the most extensive, even if it's a lower grade. For example, if the primary is 3 (60%) and secondary is 4 (40%), the score is 3+4=7. If primary is 4 (60%) and secondary is 3 (40%), it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7, but the order matters for the grade group. So in the given text, the major component is Gleason 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%), so the correct Gleason score should be 3+4=7. However, I need to check if the user's example considered the higher grade as the first component. In the example, the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. So the order is based on the order mentioned or the actual primary and secondary? The example's text mentions "4 ja 3", so the user's example used 4+3. But in reality, the primary is the most extensive. So perhaps in the current case, since the major is 3 (90%) and minor 4 (10%), the correct format is 3+4=7. However, the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). So in the worst lesion (sample 4), the Gleason is 3 and 4. But which is the primary? The text says "isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)". So the larger part is Gleason 3, smaller is 4. Therefore, the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score is 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7 when the order in the text was 4 and 3. So perhaps the order in the text is the order of the components. Wait, in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so the user took 4+3. In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the major) and then Gleason 4 (minor). So the correct format would be 3+4=7. But I need to confirm. The key is that the major component is the most extensive, which here is 3 (90%), so the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
