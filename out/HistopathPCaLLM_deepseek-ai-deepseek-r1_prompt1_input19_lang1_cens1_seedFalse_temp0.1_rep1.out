Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields and the provided text to figure out the correct answers.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the beginning mentions "Näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." Translating that, it says the samples are typically processed prostate tissue samples, routinely handled for the sample type. However, it doesn't explicitly state the type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text refers to samples 1-4, but the original sample type isn't specified. So I think the answer here is "NA" because the type isn't mentioned directly.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions that sample 4 shows cellular architecture deviating from normal prostate tissue. There's a suspicion of possible malignancy: "mahdollisesti malignia". However, it's stated that they need to verify if there's a mix-up with non-prostate tissue or if it's truly abnormal. Since it's uncertain and requires further confirmation, but there's a mention of possible malignancy, should this be considered as "kyllä"? Wait, the instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. The samples 2 and 3 are benign, sample 1 is non-representative, and sample 4 is under question. Since the malignancy is not confirmed yet but is a possibility, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but the system might require confirmation. Alternatively, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA"? The example given in the prompt had a clear malignancy. Here, the report is uncertain. The question says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's uncertain, but there's a mention of possible malignancy, should we consider it as "kyllä"? Or since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei"? Hmm. The key is whether there's a confirmed malignancy. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" (possibly malignant) and they need to check for lab error. Since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer should be "ei" because the presence isn't confirmed. But the example had a clear case. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if it's uncertain. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). The worst here is sample 4, which is under investigation. Since the malignancy is not confirmed, but there's a suspicion, perhaps the answer is "kyllä" because the possibility is mentioned. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed. The example had a clear malignancy. In this case, the report is uncertain. The question is whether there were malignant findings. If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä"? The user's instructions might expect "kyllä" if there's any mention, but I need to be careful. Let me check the original text again. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" and they are checking for lab error. So it's possible but not confirmed. The malignancy field is "oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (were there malignant findings in the sample). If the findings are uncertain, perhaps the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. But maybe the system expects "kyllä" if there's any mention. This is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe "NA" is used when it's unclear. But the options don't include "NA" for malignancy unless it's not mentioned. Here, it's mentioned as a possibility. Hmm. The example given had a clear "adenokarsinoomaa" which is malignant. In this case, the answer might be "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, even if not confirmed. But I'm not certain. Maybe the correct approach is to mark it as "kyllä" because the possibility is raised, and the worst case is considered. So I'll go with "kyllä".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is uncertain, but if we marked malignancy as "kyllä", then Gleason should be reported. However, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. The sample 4 has cellular changes but no specific Gleason grading is provided. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA" because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "kyllä" due to suspicion. Gleason is "NA" because no score is given.
