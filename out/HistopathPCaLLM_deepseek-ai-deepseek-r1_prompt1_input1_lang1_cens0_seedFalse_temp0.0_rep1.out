Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text here mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista". The word "neulabiopsiaa" translates to needle biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so Gleason isn't applicable.

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "neulabiopsiaa" is biopsy, "benign" is non-malignant. Everything seems to align. No mention of any Gleason grading here because it's benign. So the final JSON should have "biopsy", "ei", and "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
