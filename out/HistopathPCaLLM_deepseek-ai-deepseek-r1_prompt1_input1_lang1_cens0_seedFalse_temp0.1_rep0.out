Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana 12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." The word "neulabiopsiaa" translates to needle biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benignin" means benign, so there are no malignant findings. The Malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

Since the result is benign, the Gleason score isn't applicable. According to the instructions, if there's no malignancy, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to format this into JSON without nested structures and ensure the values match the allowed options. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of malignancy or Gleason scores. Yep, it's all benign. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
