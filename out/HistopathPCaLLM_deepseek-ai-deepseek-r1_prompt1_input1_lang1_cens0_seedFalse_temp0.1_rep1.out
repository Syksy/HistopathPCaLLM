Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana 12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." The key term here is "neulabiopsiaa", which translates to "needle biopsy" in English. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states: "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so there are no malignant findings. Therefore, malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided in the problem shows that when malignancy is "kyllä", the Gleason is filled, but here it's "ei", so Gleason is "NA". 

Double-checking the sample type: "neulabiopsiaa" definitely refers to a biopsy. The malignancy is clearly stated as benign, so no issues there. Gleason isn't mentioned because there's no malignancy, so "NA" is correct. All fields are correctly filled without any nesting. The final JSON should look as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
