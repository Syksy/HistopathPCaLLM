Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The key term here is "prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista" which translates to samples taken from specific locations of the prostate. This sounds like a biopsy, as it's referring to taking samples from different spots. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" which translates to gland structures and some wavy epithelium. Wavy epithelium might refer to benign changes. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so maybe they haven't found malignancy yet. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since it's not mentioned, and the conclusion isn't ready, should I default to "ei" or "NA"? The example given in the problem uses "NA" only when benign. Wait, the instructions say for Gleason, use "NA" if benign. For Malignancy, the options are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't mention malignancy, but the conclusion is pending, maybe it's safer to put "NA" here. But the example had a case where malignancy was present. Wait, in the example, the answer was "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, there's no mention of malignancy, just some benign structures. So maybe "ei" (no) is correct. But the conclusion is pending, so maybe the pathologist hasn't decided yet. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the report doesn't state any, even if the conclusion is pending, perhaps the answer is "ei". But I need to be careful. The text says "nähdään mm. rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" which are benign findings. No mention of cancer. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". The example used "NA" when benign. So in this case, since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Let me double-check the original text for any clues I might have missed. The sample is from prostate tissue, multiple sites, sufficient quantity. They see gland structures and some wavy epithelium. The final conclusion is pending. No mention of cancer, so Malignancy is "ei". Therefore, the JSON should be as follows.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
