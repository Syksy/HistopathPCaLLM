Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text is "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The key term here is "prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term "sovituista paikoista" might refer to biopsy sites, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, I should mark it as NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Nähdään mm. rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä." The presence of "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (undulating epithelium) might be a benign finding. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or other malignant terms like "adenokarsinoomaa" which was in the example. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so the final diagnosis isn't available. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, but the report is not finalized, should I mark it as "ei" (no) or "NA"? The instructions say if there are no malignant findings, use "ei". But since the conclusion is pending, maybe it's safer to put "NA". Wait, the question says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – if the report doesn't mention any malignancy, even if it's pending, the answer would be "ei". But the example had a clear malignancy. Here, the findings mentioned are benign structures. So maybe "ei" is correct. But the final conclusion is pending, so maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed yet. Hmm. The user instruction says to consider only the existing findings. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the answer should be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason grades here. The example included Gleason when malignancy was present. Here, since malignancy is not present (or not reported yet), Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are mentioned. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy. Wait, but the conclusion is pending. Does that affect malignancy? The user instruction says to report based on the findings in the sample. If the current findings don't show malignancy, even if the final conclusion is pending, the answer is "ei". So I think that's correct.
