Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The term "prostatakudosta" translates to prostate tissue, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" which translates to gland structures and some wavy epithelium. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so malignancy isn't confirmed. Hence, Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy reported. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. The example provided uses simple key-value pairs, so I'll follow that structure.

Double-checking the Finnish terms to make sure I didn't miss any malignancy indicators. Words like "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) or "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant) aren't present. The report is still pending, so the final diagnosis isn't available yet. Therefore, all three fields should be "NA".
