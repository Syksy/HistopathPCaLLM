Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, so I need to look for similar terms in the input text. The input here mentions "Prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista". "Sovituista paikoista" might refer to biopsy sites, but the exact term "biopsia" isn't present. However, "prostatakudos" translates to prostate tissue. Since there's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), and it's talking about samples from specific sites, maybe it's a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. If there's uncertainty, should I default to "NA"? The example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. Here, the term isn't as clear. Maybe "NA" is safer here since the original text doesn't explicitly state the sample type.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "rauhasrakenteita" (gland structures) and "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (undulating epithelium). These terms don't indicate malignancy. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"), so there's no mention of cancer. Therefore, malignancy should be "ei" because there's no evidence of malignancy reported yet. Wait, but "ei" means no malignancy. If the report is pending, maybe it's not confirmed. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the final conclusion isn't ready yet, but the current findings don't mention malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the report is pending, maybe it's "NA". But the instructions say to report based on the sample's findings. Since no malignancy is mentioned, and the conclusion isn't final, but the current observations don't show malignancy, "ei" might be appropriate. The example had a clear malignancy, so here the absence of malignant terms suggests "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" here, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports this.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is "ei" because no signs mentioned. Gleason is "NA" as no malignancy. Let me check the example again. The example had "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was present. Here, the sample is from prostate tissue, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype is "NA". Malignancy: no mention, so "ei". Gleason: "NA".
