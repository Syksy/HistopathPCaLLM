Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and the provided medical statement to extract the required structured data. The user wants the output in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement mentions "prostatectomy resection," which I know is typically referred to as RP in medical terms. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The statement clearly states "adenocarcinoma" in the samplings from apex and basis. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the user wants the most severe lesion's grade in the format major+minor=sum. The text mentions two areas: the apex has Gleason 3+4, and the basis has 4+4. The most severe would be the higher sum. 3+4=7 and 4+4=8. Since 8 is higher, the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. No typos in the keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Allowed values are respected. The answer should be valid JSON without any extra fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
