Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given medical statement and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostatectomy resection," which I know is typically referred to as RP in medical terms. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there were malignant tumor findings. The text states "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The text mentions two areas: the apex with Gleason 3+4 and the basis with 4+4. Comparing these, 4+4 is higher (sum 8) than 3+4 (sum 7). The most severe is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so Sampletype is RP. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is the highest reported, which is 4+4=8. That's all. Let me double-check the example provided to ensure the format matches. The example uses "4+3=7" as the Gleason value, so following that pattern, "4+4=8" is correct.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
