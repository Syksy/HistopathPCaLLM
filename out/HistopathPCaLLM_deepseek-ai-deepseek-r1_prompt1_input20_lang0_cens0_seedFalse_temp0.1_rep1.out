Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." I know that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given prefers the format "major+minor=sum". The text has two mentions: "Gleason 3+4" and "class 4+4". Since we need the most severe lesion, we should pick the higher grade. Gleason 4+4=8 is higher than 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the example uses "4+3=7". The order here is important. The user specified that the most severe lesion should be considered. The basis presents mostly with 4+4, which is a higher sum (8) compared to 3+4 (7). So the correct Gleason is 4+4=8.

Double-checking the allowed values for Gleason: it should be in the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text uses "3+4" and "4+4", so "4+4=8" is correct.

No mention of biopsy or TURP, so sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is 4+4=8. All fields accounted for. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. That should be it.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
