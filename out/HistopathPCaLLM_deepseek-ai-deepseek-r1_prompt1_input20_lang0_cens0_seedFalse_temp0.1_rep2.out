Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and the provided medical statement to extract the required information. The user wants structured data in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given statement mentions "prostatectomy resection". I recall that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement clearly states "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Since adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, the Malignancy field should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants the most severe lesion's Gleason grade in "major+minor=sum" format. The text mentions two areas: the apex has Gleason 3+4, and the basis has 4+4. Comparing these, 4+4=8 is more severe than 3+4=7. Therefore, the highest grade here is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. That fits the requirements. No other information conflicts with this. The answer should be valid JSON without any extra nesting.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
