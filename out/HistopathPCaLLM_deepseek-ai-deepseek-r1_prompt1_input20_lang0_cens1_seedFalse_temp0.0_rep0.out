Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." That sounds like a biopsy procedure where samples are taken from different regions. But wait, the text also says the samples have been highly affected by therapies. However, the method of obtaining the samples isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Hmm. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, the text just says "prostate tissue samples." Maybe the sample type isn't specified here, so I should go with NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." So they can't determine if there's adenocarcinoma (which is malignant). The example had a clear "adenocarcinoma detected," but here it's impossible. The hypothetical mentions "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but that's a hypothetical scenario. Since the actual examination couldn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be NA, not yes or no.

For Gleason grade, the example used the format "4+3=7". The text here mentions a hypothetical "3+4" but states that even if that were found, the patient's situation is influenced by other treatments. Since the actual samples can't be assessed due to therapy effects, there's no confirmed Gleason grade. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the method isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's impossible to determine, and Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed grade. The hypotheticals don't count as actual findings. The instructions say to use the most severe lesion's results, but in this case, there's no confirmed lesion. So all fields are NA.
