Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't explicitly stated. So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions that even if a lower Gleason like 3+4 could be found, the main issue is other treatments. Since they can't confirm adenocarcinoma because of the therapies affecting the samples, there's no clear malignant finding. So Malignancy should be "no" because they can't confirm it, but wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Wait, maybe if it's impossible to determine, should it be NA? Hmm. The user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if they can't examine it, maybe it's NA. But the example given in the instructions had a case where adenocarcinoma was detected. Here, it's impossible. So maybe Malignancy is "no" if no cancer found, but if it's uncertain, maybe NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" so they can't determine. So perhaps Malignancy is NA. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the sample is too damaged to assess, does that count as NA for malignancy? The user might consider that if the presence can't be determined, then Malignancy is NA. But the example given in the instructions had a clear yes. Here, the answer isn't clear. Let me check the text again. The samples are highly affected, making examination impossible. So there's no evidence of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. So maybe Malignancy is "no"? Or is it NA? The user's example used "yes" when adenocarcinoma was detected. Here, since they can't examine, maybe it's "no" if no malignancy was found, but if they can't assess, then NA. The text doesn't say they found any malignancy, just that it's impossible to check. So perhaps Malignancy is NA. But I need to be careful. The user's instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." If there's no lesion found, then Malignancy would be "no". But if the assessment couldn't be done, maybe NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." So they can't determine if there's malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The text mentions "even in the hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found..." but this is a hypothetical. The actual report doesn't confirm any Gleason score. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because they couldn't assess due to sample issues, and Gleason is NA because no actual grade was reported, just a hypothetical.
