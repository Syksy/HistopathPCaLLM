Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from apex, middle, and basis regions. The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated, but since they're talking about tissue samples obtained, maybe that's a biopsy. However, sometimes RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. The text doesn't mention either of those procedures directly. The samples are just referred to as obtained, so maybe the sample type isn't specified here. So Sampletype might be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." So they can't determine if there's adenocarcinoma because the samples are compromised. Even if they mention a hypothetical lower Gleason like 3+4, that's just a scenario, not an actual finding. So there's no confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA because it's uncertain.

Lastly, Gleason. The text mentions a hypothetical "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clarifies that even if found, the focus is on other treatments. Since this is a hypothetical and not an actual finding, there's no reported Gleason grade. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the exact procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because they can't confirm due to affected samples, and Gleason is NA because there's no actual grade reported, only a hypothetical.
