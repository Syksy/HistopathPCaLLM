Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy. In medical terms, "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says that in the apex, it's best suited for Gleason 3+4, and in the basis, mainly 4+4. The instruction says to take the worst lesion. Gleason 4+4=8 is worse than 3+4=7. So the highest grade here is 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason value should be "4+4=8".

Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is definitely RP because it's a prostatectomy specimen. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of adenocarcinoma. The worst Gleason is 4+4=8 from the basis. All seems correct. No nested structures, just the three fields as required.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
