Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti..." which translates to "The sample is a prostatectomy resection..." So prostatektomiaresekaatti likely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa." That means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, we need the major + minor = sum. The report says in the apex, it's best suited for Gleason 3+4, and in the base, mainly 4+4. The instruction says to take the worst lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher sum is 4+4=8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a flat structure, so just the three keys. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is "RP", Malignancy "kyllä", and Gleason "4+4=8". No issues with allowed values here. Everything seems to fit.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
