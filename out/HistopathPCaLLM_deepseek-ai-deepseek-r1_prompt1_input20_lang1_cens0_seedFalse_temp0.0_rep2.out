Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to "The sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatektomiaresekaatti refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, we need to report the major + minor = sum format. The text says that in the apex longitudinal section, the best fit is Gleason 3+4, and in the base, mainly 4+4. The instruction specifies to take the worst lesion's result. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the worst is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. The other details like focus sizes or margins aren't relevant here. Also, checking that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. No issues spotted, so the JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
