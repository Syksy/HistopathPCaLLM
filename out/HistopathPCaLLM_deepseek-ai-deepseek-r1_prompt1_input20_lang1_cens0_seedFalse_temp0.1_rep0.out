Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given report starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to "The sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatektomiaresekaatti refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type here should be "RP."

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The report mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, we need the worst (pahin) lesion. The report states that in the apex longitudinal section, it's best classified as Gleason 3+4, but in the base, it's mainly 4+4. The highest or worst here would be 4+4=8. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result, so Gleason should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are in the allowed formats. No nested structures, just the three fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" is indeed RP. The adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. The highest Gleason mentioned is 4+4=8. All looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
