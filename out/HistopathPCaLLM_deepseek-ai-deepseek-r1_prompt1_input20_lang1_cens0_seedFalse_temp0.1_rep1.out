Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to "The sample is a prostatectomy resection." So prostatektomiaresekaatti likely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. So there are malignant findings. Hence, Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the report says "Apexin pitkittäinen leike... Gleason 3+4 luokkaan" and "basiksessa lähinnä luokkaa 4+4." The instruction is to take the worst lesion's result. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher sum is 8. So the major is 4 and minor is 4, making the Gleason score "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst Gleason. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. No issues spotted here. The margins and other findings like no extracapsular extension don't affect the required fields, so they can be ignored.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
