Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "prostatektomiaresekaatti". I need to translate that into one of the allowed terms. "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" translates to prostatectomy resection, which I believe corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text has two mentions: "Gleason 3+4" and "lähinnä luokkaa 4+4". Since we need the worst (pahimman) lesion, the highest sum here is 4+4=8. However, the instruction says to take the worst lesion's result. The first one is 3+4=7, the second is 4+4=8. So the worst is 4+4=8. But wait, the example given in the problem uses the format "4+3=7". So the correct format here would be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and that only the worst Gleason is reported. The text mentions two different Gleason scores, but we pick the higher one. Also, check that the sample type is correctly mapped. "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" is indeed RP. The margins and other findings like no extracapsular extension don't affect these specific fields. So the final JSON should be as above.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
