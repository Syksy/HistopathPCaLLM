Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The text also mentions that the samples are divided into six parts from apex to base, which sounds like a biopsy procedure. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "näytteet" (samples) is generic. Since the example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta", but here there's no such direct term. Wait, the text says "näytteiden shiftailu pitkittäisesti tai poikittaisesti" which might refer to how the samples were taken, but not the method. Without a clear indication, maybe the sample type is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text states that "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" (evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible) due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. So, they can't confirm malignancy. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the assessment is impossible, does that mean they didn't find any, or they can't determine? The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the presence can't be assessed, maybe "ei" (no) isn't correct. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't state it's absent. So perhaps "NA" is appropriate here. Wait, the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. But in this case, the samples are too altered to assess. So malignancy is uncertain, hence "NA".

Third, Gleason score. The text mentions a hypothetical situation where a low-level Gleason like 3+4 might be found, but even then, they would prioritize ongoing treatments. Since this is a hypothetical, the actual report doesn't state a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy, and the example shows that if malignancy is "ei" or "NA", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA". Malignancy can't be determined due to altered samples, so "NA". Gleason isn't reported because malignancy isn't confirmed, so "NA".
