Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The text also mentions that the samples are divided into six parts from apex to base, which sounds like a biopsy procedure. There's no mention of RP or TURP, so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. However, there's a hypothetical mention of a low-grade Gleason (3+4). But since the actual assessment can't confirm malignancy because of the altered tissue, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. So, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm malignancy, just a hypothetical scenario.

For Gleason score, the report mentions a hypothetical situation where a low-grade Gleason 3+4 might be found. However, since the samples are altered and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason score isn't applicable. Therefore, it should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no confirmed malignancy, so Gleason remains NA. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text to confirm there's no other mention of sample types or confirmed malignancy. Yep, looks right. The key points are the impossibility of evaluation due to altered tissue and the hypothetical Gleason which isn't actual.
