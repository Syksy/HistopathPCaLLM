Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text to find the necessary information.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet jaetaan kuuteen pääsettiin..." which translates to samples taken from the prostate. The word "näytteet" (samples) is used, but the exact type isn't specified. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think the answer here is NA because the type isn't clearly stated.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which means evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. Since they can't confirm malignancy because of the treatments affecting the samples, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. However, there's a hypothetical mention of a low-grade Gleason (3+4), but that's in a hypothetical scenario. So the actual findings don't confirm malignancy. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the evaluation is impossible, maybe the answer is NA? Or does the fact that they can't assess it mean it's not confirmed, so malignancy is "ei"? Hmm. The key phrase is "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" – they can't assess it, so the sample doesn't show clear malignancy. So Malignancy would be "ei" because no malignancy was found, or is it NA because it couldn't be assessed? The user's example had a case where malignancy was present. Here, since the assessment is impossible, maybe the answer is "ei" because the sample doesn't show clear signs, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. But in this case, the samples are altered, so they can't evaluate. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was detected, or NA because it's uncertain. The example uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's impossible to assess, so maybe the answer is "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the text doesn't say they found any. Alternatively, since they can't assess, maybe it's NA. The user's allowed values are kyllä, ei, NA. The text says the samples are altered, making evaluation impossible. So perhaps the malignancy status can't be determined, hence NA. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings. If they can't assess, then the answer is NA. So I think Malignancy is NA here.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed, and the Gleason mentioned is in a hypothetical scenario ("hypoteettisessa tilanteessa jos vaikka matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4) löytyisi"), that's not an actual finding. Therefore, the Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is NA (couldn't be assessed), Gleason is NA (no confirmed malignancy, hypothetical mention doesn't count).
