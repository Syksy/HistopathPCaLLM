Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part of the given text to find the relevant information.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet jaetaan kuuteen pääsettiin..." which translates to samples taken from the prostate. The term "näytteet" (samples) is a bit generic. The report doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Since it's not explicitly stated, I might have to go with NA here. But wait, sometimes in medical reports, the type can be inferred. However, in this case, there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy or surgery. So Sampletype is likely NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta johtuen paikallisista hoidoista" which means assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments. Also, "eturauhasen kudosnäytteet ovat selkeästi muuntuneita" indicates the samples are altered. So they can't confirm malignancy. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the assessment is impossible, does that mean they can't determine it, so Malignancy is NA? Or is there a mention of possible malignancy? The text mentions "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman" (possible adenocarcinoma), but it's stated that evaluation is impossible. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. However, the user instructions say to report if there were malignant findings. Since they can't assess due to treatments, maybe the answer is NA. But the example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is found. Here, it's possible but unconfirmed. The question is whether the sample contains malignant findings. Since they can't evaluate, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, if the text says there's no evidence, but here it's unclear. The key phrase is "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" – evaluation is impossible. So the presence isn't confirmed, hence Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason would be NA. However, the text mentions a hypothetical situation: "hypoteettisessa tilanteessa jos vaikka matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4) löytyisi..." which is a hypothetical case. The actual sample doesn't have a Gleason score because they couldn't assess due to treatments. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because they can't confirm due to altered samples, and Gleason is NA because there's no actual finding, just a hypothetical mention.
