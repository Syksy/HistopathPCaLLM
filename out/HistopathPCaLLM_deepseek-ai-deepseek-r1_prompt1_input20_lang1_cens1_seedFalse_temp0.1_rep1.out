Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part of the given text to find the relevant information.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet jaetaan kuuteen pääsettiin..." which translates to samples taken from the prostate. The word "näytteet" (samples) is used, but the exact type isn't specified. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think the Sampletype here is NA because the type isn't clearly stated.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta johtuen paikallisista hoidoista" which means assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments. Also, "eturauhasen kudosnäytteet ovat selkeästi muuntuneita" (samples are clearly altered). Since they can't confirm malignancy because of the treatments, but there's a mention of possible adenocarcinoma, but the samples are altered. The presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe the answer here is "ei" or NA. Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the assessment is impossible, maybe Malignancy is NA. But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. However, in this case, they can't assess due to altered samples. So maybe Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. But the example given in the problem had a case where malignancy was present. Here, the text says even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, they would prioritize ongoing treatments. But the actual samples can't be assessed. So the answer here is that malignancy can't be determined, hence NA.

Third, Gleason. The format is major+minor=sum. Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed, and the samples are altered, the Gleason score isn't provided. Even though there's a hypothetical mention of 3+4, it's not an actual finding. The report states that even if such a score were found, it's hypothetical. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because they can't assess due to altered samples. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy and the 3+4 is hypothetical.
