Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The text also mentions that the samples are divided into parts from apex to base, which sounds like a biopsy procedure. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "näytteet" (samples) is generic. Since it's not specified, maybe the sample type is NA here. But wait, sometimes in medical reports, if they talk about taking multiple samples from different regions, it's often a biopsy. However, without clear terms like "biopsia" (biopsy in Finnish), I might have to go with NA. Hmm, but the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention biopsy explicitly. So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says that evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. It also mentions that even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, they would prioritize ongoing treatments. So, the presence of malignancy is uncertain because the samples are transformed, making assessment impossible. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since they can't assess it due to treatment effects, the answer might be "ei" (no) because they didn't find any definitive malignancy, or "NA" because it's uncertain. But the options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since the report states that the assessment is impossible, and no malignancy is confirmed, maybe Malignancy is "ei". Wait, but the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, they can't confirm it, so maybe "ei" is not correct. Alternatively, since they mention "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" (evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible), it's unclear. So perhaps Malignancy should be "NA" because the presence can't be determined. But the options are only yes, no, or NA. If the samples are inconclusive, maybe NA is appropriate here.

Third, Gleason score. The text mentions a hypothetical situation where a low-grade Gleason like 3+4 might be found, but since the assessment is impossible and the samples are transformed, there's no actual Gleason reported. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy, and the mention is hypothetical.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the type isn't specified), Malignancy is NA (because it's uncertain due to altered samples), and Gleason is NA (no confirmed malignancy). But wait, the user instructions say that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. However, in this case, there's no confirmed malignancy, so all fields related to malignancy would be NA. Let me double-check the Finnish terms. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which means evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible. So they can't determine if there's malignancy, hence Malignancy is NA. Gleason is also NA because there's no confirmed malignancy. Sampletype: the text mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" (prostate tissue samples) but doesn't specify the method. So Sampletype is NA.
