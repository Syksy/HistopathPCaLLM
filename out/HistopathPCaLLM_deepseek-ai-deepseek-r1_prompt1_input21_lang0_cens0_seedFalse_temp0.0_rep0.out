Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often leading to chippings. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chippings. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Also, nuclei being enlarged with visible nucleoli are signs of cancer. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For Gleason, the key part is: "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." The Gleason score is typically major + minor = sum. Here, the primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so 5+4=9. The user prefers the format "major+minor=sum," so "5+4=9."

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses the highest Gleason found, which aligns with the instruction. The answer should be in JSON without nested structures. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype: TURP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 5+4=9. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
