Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often leading to chippings. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chippings. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "poorly differentiated growth," "nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth and nuclear atypia are strong indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For Gleason, the text states: "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the most prevalent (major) and second most prevalent (minor) grades. So major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which here is the Gleason 5+4=9. Everything checks out. No ambiguities here. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
