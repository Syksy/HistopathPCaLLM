Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings." From what I know, "chippings" and "shavings" are terms often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, like needle cores, while RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the entire gland. So Sampletype here should be "TURP."

Next, determining malignancy. The text describes "poorly differentiated growth," which is a sign of malignancy. Also, there's mention of "tumor-like tissue" with Gleason grades. Since Gleason grading is used for carcinomas, this indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the report states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. The correct format is major + minor = sum. So that's 5+4=9. Even though the sum is 9, which is high, the format is correct as per the example given. So Gleason should be "5+4=9."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the most common is 5 and the next is 4, that's the primary and secondary patterns. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
