Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often resulting in chips. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "poorly differentiated growth," "nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth and nuclear features like prominent nucleoli are strong indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

Lastly, Gleason grade. The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant. The text states: "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." So the primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4. Therefore, Gleason would be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report specifies the most common and second most common, that's the primary and secondary patterns. Also, no nested structures in JSON. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as TURP, Malignancy yes, and Gleason 5+4=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
