Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they're asking for. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I have to make sure each field adheres to those.

Starting with the first field: Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the first part mentions "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" is a bit unclear, but "TURP" typically refers to the removal of prostate tissue using a resectoscope, often resulting in chips or fragments. So "chippings" here likely refers to TURP samples. Therefore, Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Additionally, the presence of Gleason grading (which is used for prostate cancer) further supports malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text states "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". In Gleason scoring, the primary (most common) pattern is listed first, followed by the secondary (next most common). So major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. Therefore, Gleason should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the report mentions the most common Gleason is 5 and second is 4, that's the highest grade present. Also, the structured result shouldn't have nested structures, so the JSON should be flat.

Double-checking the allowed values for each field. Sampletype is TURP, which is allowed. Malignancy is yes, which is correct. Gleason is in the correct format. All looks good. No NA needed here because all information is present.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
