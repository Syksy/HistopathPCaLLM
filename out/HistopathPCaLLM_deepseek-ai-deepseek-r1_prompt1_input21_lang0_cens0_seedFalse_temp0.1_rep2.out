Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings". I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which often results in chippings or shavings. Biopsy samples are usually smaller pieces, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the entire prostate. So here, the sample type should be TURP.

Next, determining malignancy. The text describes "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grades (which are used for cancer grading) suggests malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the report states the most common is 5 and the second most is 4. The format should be major + minor = sum. So that's 5+4=9. Even though the sum is 9, the correct format is to present it as "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check allowed values: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 5+4=9. All valid. No mention of benign findings, so no need to consider other possibilities. The most severe lesion is the one with Gleason 5+4=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
