Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated here. However, the description of fragments being extracted and processed for histology might suggest a biopsy. But I need to be careful. TURP usually refers to removing tissue from the prostate to relieve symptoms, often in cases of BPH. RP is the surgical removal of the entire prostate. Since the text mentions fragments and histology, but doesn't specify the procedure, maybe it's safer to put NA here unless there's a clear indicator. Wait, the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, the text doesn't mention the procedure type, just "extracted prostate material." So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed." Carpet-like growth might be a term used for certain growth patterns, but I'm not sure if that's indicative of malignancy. The nuclei are dissolved, and there's technical noise affecting the assessment. The text also mentions that half the area is too noisy, and additional QC is needed. Since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant cells, and the assessment is confounded, the malignancy can't be confirmed. So Malignancy should be NA here.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" when both grades are mentioned. In this case, there's no mention of Gleason grades because the assessment is hindered by technical noise. The report states that differentiation patterns can't be assessed properly. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed due to technical issues, and Gleason is NA because the grades couldn't be assessed.
