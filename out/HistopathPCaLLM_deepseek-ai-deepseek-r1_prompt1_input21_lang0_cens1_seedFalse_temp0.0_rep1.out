Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece." The term "extracted" and "fragments" might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the statement doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here, so I should go with NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed," but then mentions technical noise affecting the assessment. There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. Carpet-like growth could be a term used in pathology, but without confirmation of malignant cells, it's uncertain. Since the report states that the assessment is confounded and additional QC is needed, there's no definitive evidence of malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. They can't assess differentiation due to technical issues, so Gleason is definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because it's not reported. The answer should be a JSON object with these values.
