Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments" and "prostate biopsy" in the example. Wait, in the example, "biopsy" was the sample type. But in the current statement, the exact wording is "extracted prostate material." Hmm, does that indicate the sample type? The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, the term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated. The material is described as fragments, which could be from a biopsy, TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or RP (radical prostatectomy). However, without specific terms like TURP or RP mentioned, maybe it's a biopsy. But the user might consider NA if it's unclear. Wait, the example had "biopsy" because the text said "prostate biopsy." Here, the text doesn't specify the procedure, just mentions "extracted prostate material." So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth," but also says "nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment." There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. Carpet-like growth could be a term used in pathology, but without confirmation of malignant cells, and given the technical issues, the report isn't confirming malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA because it's uncertain due to the noise and inability to assess properly.

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" when Gleason grades are mentioned. Here, the text states that technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns, so they can't determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified beyond "extracted prostate material." Malignancy is NA because the assessment is inconclusive. Gleason is NA because differentiation couldn't be assessed.
