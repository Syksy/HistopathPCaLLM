Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) and describes poorly differentiated growth, enlarged nuclei, etc., which are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." This translates to the primary pattern 5 and secondary pattern 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are included and that the JSON structure isn't nested. The example provided uses the format without any nesting, so I'll follow that exactly. Let me double-check the terms to make sure I didn't misinterpret anything. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is correctly calculated. All seems good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
