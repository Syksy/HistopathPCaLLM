Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text mentions "paljon fibromuskulaaria stroomaa ja mattomaista huonosti erilaistunetta kasvua stroomassa" which includes terms like "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth), and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue). These indicate malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score: The text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. All the necessary information is present here. No conflicting data, so the final JSON should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
