Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: the report starts with "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typically associated with a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text mentions "kasvainkudosta" which means tumor tissue, and describes poorly differentiated growth ("huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua") with enlarged, variable-sized nuclei. These are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score: the text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The example provided uses the format correctly, so following that, the JSON should be straightforward. Let me double-check each part again to confirm accuracy.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
