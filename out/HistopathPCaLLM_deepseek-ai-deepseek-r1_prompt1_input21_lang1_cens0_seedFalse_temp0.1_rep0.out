Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "lastuja" translates to chips, which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chips. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate, which isn't the case here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text describes "mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" which means poorly differentiated growth, indicative of malignancy. Also, it mentions "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue), confirming malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the report states "eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4. The sum is 5+4=9. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 5+4=9. All other details like the amount of tissue or stromal changes don't affect the required fields. So the JSON should reflect these three points accurately.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
