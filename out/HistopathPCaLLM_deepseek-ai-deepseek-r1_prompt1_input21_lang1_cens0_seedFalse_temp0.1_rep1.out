Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typical for a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "kasvainkudosta" which means tumor tissue, and describes poorly differentiated growth with enlarged, variable nuclei and prominent nucleoli—these are signs of malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The example provided uses "biopsy" as sample type when biopsy is mentioned, which aligns with TURP here. All criteria seem met. No conflicting information in the text. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
