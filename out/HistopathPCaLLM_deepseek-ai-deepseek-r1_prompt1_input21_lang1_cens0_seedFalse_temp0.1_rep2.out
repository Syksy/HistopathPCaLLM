Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these one by one based on the provided text.

First, the sample type. The original text starts with "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chips. RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy, but there's no mention of surgical removal of the entire prostate here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth) and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue). These terms indicate malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grading (taso 5 and 4) is a clear sign of cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the report states "eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4". The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is correctly formatted. No other information in the text contradicts these conclusions.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
