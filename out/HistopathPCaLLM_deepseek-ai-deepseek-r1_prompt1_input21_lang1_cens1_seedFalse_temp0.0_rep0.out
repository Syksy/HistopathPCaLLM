Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale..." The mention of "fragmentti" (fragments) and the context of extracting material suggests it's a biopsy. RP usually refers to radical prostatectomy, and TURP is transurethral resection. Since it's fragmented and mentions "histologiaan" (histology), biopsy seems right. So Sampletype is "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" (stromal tissue and mat-like growth). However, it also states that "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical noise makes assessing cell differentiation difficult. There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The report seems inconclusive, possibly due to poor sample quality. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or "NA". But wait, the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be a benign growth. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer, maybe "ei" is appropriate. But I'm not entirely sure. The example given in the problem had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was mentioned. Here, there's no such mention, so likely "ei" or "NA". However, the user instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't state it's benign, maybe "NA" is safer. But the example used "kyllä" when malignancy was present. Here, since there's no clear malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct. Hmm. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" which might be benign. So Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since we determined Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA". But wait, if Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. If Malignancy were "kyllä", then we'd need to look for Gleason scores. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades in the text, even if Malignancy were "kyllä", but in this case, since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text for any missed keywords. The text talks about technical issues and sample quality, but no mention of cancer. So yes, the answer should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
