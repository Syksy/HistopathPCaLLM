Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each requirement.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti..." which translates to extracted prostate material consisting of multiple fragments. The term "fragmentti" (fragments) often relates to biopsy samples, as biopsies typically yield fragmented tissue. So Sampletype here is likely "biopsy".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" (stromal tissue and mat-like growth are seen). However, it also mentions that the nuclei (tumat) are faded and technical background noise complicates assessing cell differentiation. There's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "carcinoma" or "karsinooma". The growth mentioned might be benign or insufficiently clear due to technical issues. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, Malignancy should be "ei" or "NA". But wait, "mattomainen kasvu" could be suspicious. However, without clear malignancy terms and considering the technical difficulties noted, it's safer to go with "ei" or maybe "NA". But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the text doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. Hmm, but sometimes stromal changes can be non-malignant. Let's check again. The key is whether there's a mention of malignant findings. The text doesn't state cancer, so Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
