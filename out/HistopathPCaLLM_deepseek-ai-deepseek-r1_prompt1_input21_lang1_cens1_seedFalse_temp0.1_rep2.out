Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti..." The key term here is "fragmentti," which suggests that the sample is fragmented. Biopsy samples are often multiple fragments, whereas RP or TURP might be more intact. So I'm leaning towards "biopsy" here. But wait, TURP can also produce fragments. However, the mention of "3/5g" and the way the sample is processed might indicate a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. Hmm. Maybe the original sample type isn't specified here. The user allows "NA" if not clear. So maybe Sampletype is "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään," which translates to stroma and mat-like growth. However, the nuclei are faded ("tumat ovat häiventyneet") and technical noise makes assessing cell differentiation difficult. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms. The focus seems to be on technical issues and sample quality. So, no clear malignancy is reported. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the user says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no mention of cancer, then "ei". But the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be benign. So likely "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since Malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention Gleason grades, which aligns with no malignancy detected.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is "ei". Gleason is "NA".
