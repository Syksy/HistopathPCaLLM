Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to identify the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The left side has carcinoma structures with Gleason scores, and there's mention of cancerous growth around neural bundles. The right side doesn't show malignancies. Since the instructions say to take the most severe lesion, the left side is malignant. So malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the left side has primary grade 3 and secondary grade 4. The format should be "major+minor=sum," so "3+4=7." Even though the order in the text is "firstly 3 and secondly 4," the major component is the higher grade. Wait, no—Gleason scoring actually takes the most predominant (major) and the next highest (minor), even if they are in order. But in the example given, the user used "4+3=7" when the text said "grades 4 and 3." So maybe the order in the text is primary then secondary, but the major is the higher one. Wait, no, the example in the instructions had "grades 4 and 3" resulting in "4+3=7." So the first mentioned is the major, even if it's lower? Wait, no, Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next highest (minor), regardless of the order mentioned. But in the example given, the user structured it as 4+3=7 when the text said "grades 4 and 3." So perhaps the user expects the order as mentioned. Wait, but in reality, the Gleason score is the highest grade as the major. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. So if the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," that would mean primary is 3 (most extensive) and secondary is 4 (next), so the sum is 3+4=7. But in the example provided by the user, the text says "grades 4 and 3" and the JSON is "4+3=7." So the order in the text is primary then secondary. Therefore, in this case, the left side has first 3, then 4, so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, in reality, the Gleason score is determined by the highest grade as the primary if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, not necessarily the highest. So if the most extensive is 3 and the next is 4, then it's 3+4=7. But if the highest grade is 4, even if it's less extensive, the current grading system (Grade Groups) might consider it differently, but the user's example just takes the order as mentioned. The example given by the user had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7, so perhaps the user expects the order as mentioned in the text. So in this case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," so the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, leading to 3+4=7. But wait, the example in the instructions had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the user's example takes the order as written. Therefore, in the current case, the order is 3 first, then 4, so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But I need to confirm. The user's example: the text says "grades 4 and 3" and the JSON is "4+3=7." So the order in the text is primary then secondary. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," so primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the correct Gleason is "3+4=7."

So putting it all together: sampletype is biopsy, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7.
