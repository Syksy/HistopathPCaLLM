Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

The original sample type: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Malignant tumor findings: The left side has carcinoma (low grade differentiation, Gleason scores 3 and 4), and the right side doesn't. Since the most severe lesion is considered, and malignancy is present on the left, the answer should be "yes."

Gleason grade: The left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The major is the higher grade, so 4, and minor is 3. So it should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The right side is benign, but left is malignant, so that's the one to report. JSON format as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
