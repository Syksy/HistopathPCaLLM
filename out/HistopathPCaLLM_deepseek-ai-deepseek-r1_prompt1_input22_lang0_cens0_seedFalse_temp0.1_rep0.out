Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they're asking for. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are given, and only the most severe lesion's results should be included.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies from both side." The term "biopsies" clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that the left side fragments have "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth." The right side doesn't show malignancies. Since carcinoma and cancerous growth are malignant, the answer here is "yes." Even though the right side is benign, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which is on the left.

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." Typically, the Gleason score is reported as the primary grade (major) followed by the secondary grade (minor), so 3+4=7. However, the example given in the user's query uses "4+3=7" when the text says "grades 4 and 3." Wait, in the example, the statement says "grades 4 and 3" but the JSON uses 4+3=7, which is correct because the primary is the higher grade if they are different? Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (primary) and the next most common (secondary). If the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," that would mean primary 3 and secondary 4, making 3+4=7. But in the example provided by the user, the statement says "grades 4 and 3" and the JSON is "4+3=7." So maybe the order in the text is primary then secondary. So in this case, the left side fragments have firstly 3 and secondly 4, so 3+4=7. But wait, the highest grade is considered the primary in the current grading system. Wait, I need to recall the current Gleason grading rules. 

Wait, prior to 2016, the Gleason score was based on the primary (most common) and secondary (next most common) patterns. However, since the 2016 revision, for biopsy specimens, if there are multiple patterns, the Gleason score is the highest grade present plus the next highest, even if the highest isn't the most extensive. Wait, no, that's for the Grade Groups. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. The Gleason score is still the sum of the most common (primary) and the second most common (secondary) grades. However, in cases where there's a tertiary pattern (third most common), that's handled differently. But in the given text, there's only two grades mentioned: 3 and 4. The text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But wait, in the example given by the user, the statement says "grades 4 and 3" and the JSON is "4+3=7". So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. So in this case, the text says "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, so primary 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. But according to current guidelines, the higher grade is considered the primary if it's more significant. Wait, no. The primary is the most extensive pattern. If the most common is 3 and the next is 4, then it's 3+4. If the most common is 4 and next is 3, it's 4+3. The example in the user's query has "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7, which aligns with primary being the first mentioned. So in the current case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". However, sometimes in reports, the higher grade is listed first even if it's less extensive. Wait, but the example given by the user seems to take the order as written. The example statement says "grades 4 and 3" and the JSON is "4+3=7". So perhaps the instruction is to take the order as mentioned in the text, regardless of which is more extensive. So in the current case, the text mentions "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, so the order is 3+4=7. But I need to check if the user's example is illustrative. Let me look again. The example statement: "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So the grades are listed as 4 and 3, and the JSON is 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as primary and secondary. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4," so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". However, in current practice, sometimes the higher grade is considered the primary if it's present, even if it's not the most extensive. Wait, no. The primary is the most extensive grade. If the most extensive is 3, and there's a secondary 4, then it's 3+4. If the most extensive is 4, then it's 4+3. But the example given by the user seems to take the order as written in the text. So perhaps the instruction is to follow the order as mentioned in the text, regardless of actual grading rules. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, so the answer should be "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example uses "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is correct according to the actual grading system if the primary is 4. But in the example statement, it's possible that the order in the text reflects the primary and secondary grades. So perhaps the user expects us to follow the order as written. Therefore, in the current case, since the text says "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, the Gleason is 3+4=7. However, in reality, if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, that's correct. So the answer here should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example uses "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is correct as per the actual grading if the primary is 4. So the example is correct. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, so the answer is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
