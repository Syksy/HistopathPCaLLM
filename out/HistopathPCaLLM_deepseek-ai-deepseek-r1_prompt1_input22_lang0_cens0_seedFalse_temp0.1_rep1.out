Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The left side fragments have carcinoma (low grade differentiation) and cancerous growth around neural bundles. The right side has no malignancies. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion, which is the left side with malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The primary pattern is the higher grade, but wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most predominant, not necessarily the higher. Wait, the user's example had 4+3=7, which suggests that the major is first. But in the given statement, it says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". 

Wait, but sometimes the higher grade is listed first if it's more severe. But the text explicitly states "firstly" and "secondly", so primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion (left side) is considered. The right side is benign, but left is malignant, so that's the one to report.
