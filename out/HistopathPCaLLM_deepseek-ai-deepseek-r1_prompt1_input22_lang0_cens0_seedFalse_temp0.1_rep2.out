Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The left side has carcinoma structures, which are malignant, and the right side doesn't. Since the question specifies to take the most severe lesion, the presence of carcinoma on the left means malignancy is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The user wants it in "major+minor=sum" format. The primary pattern is the higher score, so 4 is major and 3 is minor. So it should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are correct according to allowed options. No NA needed here since all info is present. Double-checking the example provided to match the format. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
