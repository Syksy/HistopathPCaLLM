Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly used, but "sampling material" often relates to a biopsy. However, the note about fragmentation and the need for reprocessing might complicate things. But since the sample is from both sides and mentions sampling material, I think "biopsy" is the most likely here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't determine malignancy due to fragmentation, the answer here should be NA. Even though there's mention of abnormal cell differentiation, without confirmation, we can't say yes or no.

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says assigning a Gleason is difficult because of the wide range of cell architectures and possible contamination. They explicitly state it's hard to assign, so there's no Gleason provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the sample couldn't be assessed, there's no severe lesion reported, so all fields default to NA except Sampletype which is biopsy.
