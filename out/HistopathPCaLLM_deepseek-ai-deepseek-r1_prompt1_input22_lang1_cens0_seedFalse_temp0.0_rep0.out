Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "prostate biopsy". So the sample type here is a biopsy. That's straightforward. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "vasemman puolen fragmenteissa näkyy lähinnä matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means "in the left side fragments, there is mainly low-differentiated carcinoma tissue". Carcinoma is malignant, so malignancy is present. However, the right side fragments ("oikean puolen fragmentit taas eivät näytä malignilta") don't show malignancy. But the question is whether there are any malignant findings in the sample. Since the left side has malignancy, the answer here should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers, or "NA" if benign. The text states "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4". So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. Sum is 3+4=7. But wait, the order here is primary (major) first. So the correct notation would be 3+4=7. However, in Gleason scoring, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, no—Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor), but if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less in quantity, it might affect the score. Wait, no, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the primary and secondary patterns, where primary is the most extensive and secondary is the next. So in this case, the major is 3 and minor is 4. But according to the latest guidelines, the Gleason score is the sum of the most common and the highest grade present. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify. 

In the traditional Gleason scoring, the score is the sum of the most prevalent grade and the highest grade present, even if the highest is less prevalent. Wait, no, that's for cases with multiple patterns. For example, if there are two patterns, the primary (most extensive) and the secondary (next most extensive). But if there's a tertiary pattern (higher grade but less extensive), that might be considered in certain contexts. However, in this case, the text says "pääsääntöisesti" (mainly) 3 and "toiseksi eniten" (second most) 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But wait, sometimes the order is written with the higher grade first. For example, if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, but if there's a higher grade, but in this case, the secondary is 4. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. So the score is primary + secondary. So 3+4=7. So the correct entry is "3+4=7".

Additionally, the right side fragments don't show malignancy, but since the left side is malignant, we only report the worst (highest) Gleason score from the sample. So the answer is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "biopsiasta")
Malignancy: kyllä (since left side has carcinoma)
Gleason: 3+4=7 (from the left side's findings)
