Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

The sample is described as "purkillinen prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä molemmilta puolilta". The term "paksuneulanäytteitä" translates to thick-needle samples, which I think refers to a biopsy. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's a needle biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Vasemman puolen fragmenteissa näkyy lähinnä matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means carcinoma cells are present on the left side. Additionally, "Oikean puolen fragmentit taas eivät näytä malignilta" indicates the right side isn't malignant. Since there's at least one malignant finding, the Malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the left side has "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4". The primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4, so sum is 3+4=7. The right side isn't malignant, so we only consider the worst lesion, which is the left side. The format should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst Gleason is reported and no nested structures. All fields are filled correctly based on the given options. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason 3+4=7. That seems right.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
