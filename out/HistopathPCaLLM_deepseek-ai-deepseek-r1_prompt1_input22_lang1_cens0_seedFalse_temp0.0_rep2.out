Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "prostate biopsy". So the sample type here is definitely a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means poorly differentiated carcinoma, indicating malignancy. Additionally, the right side fragments don't show malignancy, but since the left side does, the overall answer should be "kyllä" because there's at least one malignant finding.

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4". So the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary is 4, making the sum 3+4=7. However, the example given in the problem statement had 4+3=7. Wait, but the primary is the higher grade if they are different. Wait, no, the primary is the most prevalent pattern. In this case, the main pattern is 3, and the next is 4. So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But I need to check if the order matters. According to Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most common pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. So even if 4 is a higher grade, if 3 is more prevalent, it's primary. So in this case, it's 3+4=7. But sometimes, when the higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, they might take the higher as primary. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive pattern. So if the main pattern is 3 and secondary is 4, it's 3+4=7. However, in some grading systems, if there's a higher grade even in a minor component, they might adjust, but according to standard Gleason scoring, it's based on the most common and then the next. So the correct sum here is 3+4=7. The example given in the problem had 4+3=7, but that's when the major was 4 and minor 3. So in this case, the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "pääsääntöisesti" (mainly) 3 and "toiseksi eniten" (second most) 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure that the system requires the major first. Yes, the standard is major (primary) + minor (secondary) = sum. So even if the minor is a higher grade, the order is based on prevalence. Wait, no, actually, in the current Gleason grading system (since 2016), the primary pattern is the one with the higher grade if there are two patterns. Wait, no, that's not correct. The primary pattern is the most extensive one, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if there are two patterns and the higher grade is less extensive, it's still the secondary. But in the case of tertiary patterns, there's a different approach. But in this case, the text clearly states that the main pattern is 3 and the second is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. However, in some cases, if the secondary is a higher grade, they might list the higher grade first. Wait, no, the primary is the most common, regardless of grade. So if the most common is 3 and the next is 4, it's 3+4=7. For example, if the majority is 3 and a smaller part is 4, it's 3+4. If the majority is 4 and a smaller part is 3, it's 4+3. So in this case, the answer should be 3+4=7.

But I need to check the example given. The example in the problem statement had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So in the example, even though the order in the text is 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3=7, which aligns with the primary being the first number. So in the example, the primary is 4, secondary is 3. So in the current case, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

Also, the right side fragments don't show malignancy, but the left side does. Since the question asks for the worst lesion, we take the left side's findings. So the malignancy is "kyllä", and the Gleason is 3+4=7.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "biopsiasta")
Malignancy: kyllä (left side has carcinoma)
Gleason: 3+4=7

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
