Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "prostate biopsy". So the sample type here is a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means poorly differentiated carcinoma, indicating malignancy. Also, the right side fragments don't show malignancy, but the left side does. Since the task is to report the worst lesion, which is malignant, the answer here should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4". So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. Sum is 3+4=7. However, the example given in the problem shows the order as major (higher) first. Wait, but in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary is the next most prevalent, but the sum is primary + secondary. However, if the secondary is higher grade, sometimes it's reported as major + minor. Wait, no, the standard is that the primary (most extensive) pattern is listed first, then the secondary (next most extensive), regardless of grade. But in the example given by the user, the example input had 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. So in that case, even though the primary was 4 and secondary 3, the sum is 7. So in the current case, the primary is 3, secondary is 4. So sum would be 3+4=7. But according to the example, the higher grade is listed first? Wait, no. The example in the problem statement was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So the primary was 4, secondary 3. But in the current case, the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the problem says to report the worst lesion's Gleason. The worst would be the highest grade. However, the Gleason score is determined by the sum of the most common and the second most common patterns. Even if the secondary is higher, the sum is primary + secondary. For example, if primary is 3 and secondary is 4, sum is 7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, sum is also 7. But the grouping might differ (Grade Group 3 vs 4). However, the user's example just takes the primary and secondary as given in the text. So in the current case, the text says "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4". So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, in modern practice, the higher grade is sometimes listed first if it's the secondary but higher. Wait, no. The standard is primary (most extensive) first, then secondary. So even if the secondary is higher grade, the order is primary + secondary. For example, if the majority is pattern 3 and a lesser amount is pattern 4, it's 3+4=7. If the majority is 4 and lesser is 3, it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7 but are considered different Grade Groups. The user's example had 4+3=7, which is Grade Group 3, whereas 3+4=7 is Grade Group 2. But the problem doesn't ask for Grade Groups, just the sum. So in this case, the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. However, the user's example shows that even if the primary is 4 and secondary 3, they list it as 4+3=7. So the order is primary then secondary. Therefore, in the current case, the primary is 3, secondary 4, so 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the text says "toiseksi eniten tapaa 4" which translates to "second most pattern 4". So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct entry is "3+4=7".

Now, checking the other parts. The right side fragments don't show malignancy, but the left side does. Since we take the worst lesion, which is malignant, malignancy is "kyllä".

Sampletype is biopsy because it's mentioned as "paksuneulanäytteitä" which refers to core needle biopsies, so "biopsy".

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and that only the worst lesion's Gleason is reported. Since the left side has the malignancy and the right doesn't, the worst is left side with Gleason 3+4=7.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
