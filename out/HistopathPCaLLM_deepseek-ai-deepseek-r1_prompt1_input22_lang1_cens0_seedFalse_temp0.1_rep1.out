Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä molemmilta puolilta." The Finnish term "paksuneulanäytteitä" translates to thick-needle samples, which I think refers to a biopsy. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. So here, it's a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Vasemman puolen fragmenteissa näkyy lähinnä matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means carcinoma cells are present on the left side. Also, "Oikean puolen fragmentit taas eivät näytä malignilta" indicates the right side isn't malignant. Since there's malignancy on the left, the overall answer should be "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason score. The left side has "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." So primary pattern 3 and secondary 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The right side isn't malignant, so we only consider the worst lesion, which is the left side. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

Wait, the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when primary is 4 and secondary 3. So the order matters here. In the user's example, major is first. So in the current case, major is 3 and minor is 4? Wait, no. Wait, Gleason scoring is based on the primary (most prevalent) pattern and the secondary (next most prevalent) pattern. The sum is primary + secondary. So in the example, "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7. In the current case, the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, so it's 3+4=7. But the user's example shows that the primary is listed first. So the correct format here would be "3+4=7".

But I need to confirm. The text says "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Yes, that's correct. So the structured data would be:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's a needle sample)
Malignancy: kyllä (since left side is malignant)
Gleason: 3+4=7 (as that's the sum for the worst lesion)

Also, the right side is non-malignant, but we only report the worst lesion, which is the left side. So the Gleason is applicable here.
