Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Needle biopsy is a common method, so "biopsy" seems correct here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "Vasemman puolen fragmenteissa näkyy lähinnä matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which means carcinoma cells are present on the left side. Also, "oikean puolen fragmentit taas eivät näytä malignilta" indicates the right side isn't malignant. Since there's malignancy on the left, the answer should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The instructions say to report the worst lesion, which is the left side here. So the format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is included. The right side's negative result doesn't affect the malignancy field since there's at least one positive. The sample type is definitely biopsy. All required fields are covered, and the values fit the allowed options.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
