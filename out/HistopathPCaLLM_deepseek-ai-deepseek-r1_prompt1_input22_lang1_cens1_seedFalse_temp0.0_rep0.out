Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample is described as "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin". The word "purkillinen" translates to "jar" or "container", but the key term here is "kudosnäytteitä", which means tissue samples. The report mentions that the samples are fragmented and from both sides (left and right). The term "biopsy" refers to a sample taken using a needle, typically. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The mention of fragmented material might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, since the sample is from both sides and fragmented, maybe it's a biopsy. Alternatively, if it's a TURP, that's usually for removing tissue from the prostate via the urethra. But the text doesn't mention surgery, just that the samples are in a jar. The term "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" (prostate tissue samples) is generic. Since it's not clear, maybe the safest answer here is "NA" because the text doesn't specify the exact type. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text says "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So perhaps the sample type is not specified, hence "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "Kroonista tulehdusta" (chronic inflammation) and "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types). There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "adenokarsinooma" or "pahanlaatuinen". The Gleason score isn't determined because the samples are too fragmented and variable. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy, and the report states that the samples are unsuitable for classification and need reprocessing, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. However, the presence of atypical cells might suggest suspicion, but according to the problem's instructions, we need to determine if there were malignant findings. Since the report doesn't state malignancy, and the samples are inconclusive, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no confirmed malignancy, or "NA" if uncertain. Wait, but the problem says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any malignancy, just chronic inflammation and atypical cells, which could be benign, then "ei" would be correct. However, sometimes atypical cells can be a sign of malignancy, but in this case, since they couldn't determine Gleason and the samples are not suitable, maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. The example given in the problem had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, there's no such mention, so "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the report says that determining Gleason is exceptionally difficult due to the wide scale of differentiation and the samples are too fragmented, they can't classify. Therefore, no Gleason score is provided. So the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignant findings reported), and Gleason is "NA".
