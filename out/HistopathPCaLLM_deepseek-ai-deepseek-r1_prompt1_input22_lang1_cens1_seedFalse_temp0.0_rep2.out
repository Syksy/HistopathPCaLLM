Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report on prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text starts with "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin..." The word "kudosnäytteitä" translates to tissue samples. The term "Purkillinen" might refer to a container, but the key here is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" which means prostate tissue samples. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's mentioned as tissue samples and not a specific procedure like RP or TURP, I think this is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "Kroonista tulehdusta" (chronic inflammation) and "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types). However, there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant) or "karsinooma". The report states that the samples are too fragmented and varied for classification and need reprocessing. So, no malignant findings are confirmed. Hence, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA". The text mentions that determining Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the fragmented and varied samples, and they need to reprocess. But since there's no confirmed malignancy, even if they tried, the result isn't applicable here. So Gleason is "NA".

Wait, but the user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. But in this case, there's no malignancy found, so Gleason is NA. The example given in the problem shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise NA. Here, malignancy is "ei", so Gleason is NA. That makes sense.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text again. No mention of cancer, just chronic inflammation and inconclusive samples. Yep, that's right.
