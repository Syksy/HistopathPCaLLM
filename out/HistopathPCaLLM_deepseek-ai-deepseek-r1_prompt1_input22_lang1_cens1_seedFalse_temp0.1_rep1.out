Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let's go through each field one by one.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin." The word "purkillinen" might refer to a container, but the key term here is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä," which translates to prostate tissue samples. Since it's about taking samples, this is likely a biopsy. RP usually refers to radical prostatectomy, and TURP is transurethral resection. The text doesn't mention surgery, so biopsy makes sense here. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "Kroonista tulehdusta" (chronic inflammation) and "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types). However, there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "adenokarsinooma" or "pahanlaatuinen." The Gleason score isn't provided because they couldn't determine it due to the samples being fragmented. So the malignancy is not confirmed. But wait, the presence of cell differentiation issues might suggest suspicion, but the task says to report only if there are malignant findings. Since they can't classify and there's no explicit malignancy stated, maybe "ei" or "NA"? The example given uses "kyllä" when malignancy is present. Here, since they can't confirm and there's no explicit mention, maybe "ei" or "NA". But the third field's Gleason is NA if benign. Let's check the report again. It says the samples are too fragmented and varied, so they can't classify. The absence of confirmed malignancy would mean "ei" (no) or maybe NA. But the options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report doesn't state malignancy, but mentions cell changes, but not definitively malignant. The example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, since they can't determine, maybe "ei" or "NA". The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If no malignancy is found, then "ei". But the report says "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" which might be atypical but not malignant. So perhaps "ei". So Malignancy: "ei".

Third, Gleason. If malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". Since they couldn't determine it due to fragmented samples, and there's no mention of a Gleason score, the answer is "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's tissue samples from prostate, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy, so no score)

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
