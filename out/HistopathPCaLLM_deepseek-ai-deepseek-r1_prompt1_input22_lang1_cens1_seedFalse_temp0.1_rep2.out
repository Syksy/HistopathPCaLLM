Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text starts with "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin." The word "purkillinen" refers to a container, but the key term here is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä," which translates to prostate tissue samples. The original sample types allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's mentioned as tissue samples and not a specific procedure like TURP or RP, I might lean towards biopsy. But wait, the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text says "Prostata biopsiasta," which is clear. Here, the term is "kudosnäytteitä," which is more general. However, in medical contexts, tissue samples taken via biopsy are common. The report doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP, so the safest bet here is "biopsy." Alternatively, if there's ambiguity, maybe NA? But the example suggests that "biopsy" is acceptable even if the term isn't explicitly used. So I'll go with "biopsy."

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "Kroonista tulehdusta" (chronic inflammation) and "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types). There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant). The report states that the samples are fragmented and not suitable for classification, needing reprocessing. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, but the presence of chronic inflammation and atypical cells might be benign. However, the key is whether malignant findings are present. The user instructions say to answer "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer or malignancy, and the Gleason grading isn't possible here, the malignancy status is likely "ei" (no). But wait, the presence of atypical cells could be a gray area. However, the absence of confirmed malignancy terms like "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed. So "ei."

Gleason score. The text says that determining the Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide scale of cell differentiation and the fragmented samples. They can't classify it, so no Gleason score is provided. Since there's no malignancy detected (as per previous answer), the Gleason should be "NA." Even if there were some suspicion, without a confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable. So "NA."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is "NA."
