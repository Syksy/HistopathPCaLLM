Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the statement starts with "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate..." Prostatectomy typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The input states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." However, the Gleason grading system usually combines the two most prevalent grades. The text mentions differentiation stage 4 (60%) as the main, then stage 5 (30%) as the second. Tertiary grade 3 is noted but since it's the smallest, it's not included in the primary sum. The primary grades are 4 and 5, so the sum is 4+5=9. The conclusion also confirms sum 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The main components here are 4 and 5, which sum to 9. The tertiary grade 3 is less significant and not part of the primary score. Therefore, the structured JSON should reflect "4+5=9".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
