Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the sample type here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components mentioned are differentiation stage 4 (60%) and stage 5 (30%), with a tertiary grade 3. However, the highest grade is the primary and secondary, which are 4 and 5. But wait, Gleason scoring typically takes the two most predominant grades. The primary (most common) is grade 4, and the secondary (next most common) is grade 5. So the sum would be 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but not included in the sum. The conclusion confirms sum 9, so the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The highest Gleason here is 9, so that's correct. Also, check that the sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is formatted correctly. All seems to fit.

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
