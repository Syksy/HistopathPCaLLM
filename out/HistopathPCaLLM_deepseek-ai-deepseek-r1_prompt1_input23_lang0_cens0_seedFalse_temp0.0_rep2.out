Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the sample type here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components mentioned are differentiation stage 4 (60%) and stage 5 (30%), with a tertiary grade 3. However, according to guidelines, the primary and secondary grades are the two most prevalent. Here, the major is 4 and the minor is 5, but since the sum is 9 (4+5=9), that's the key part. The tertiary grade 3 is the least and doesn't affect the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and only the most severe lesion is considered. The highest Gleason here is 9, so that's correct. All fields are filled without using NA. Double-checking the sample type: prostatectomy is RP. Malignancy is yes. Gleason format matches the example. Looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
