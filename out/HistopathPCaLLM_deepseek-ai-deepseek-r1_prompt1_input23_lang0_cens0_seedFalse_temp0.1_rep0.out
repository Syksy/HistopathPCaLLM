Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a surgical specimen from a prostatectomy. So RP would be the correct sample type here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format major+minor=sum. The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components mentioned are grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%), with a tertiary grade 3. According to current guidelines, the primary and secondary grades are the two most common, even if the secondary is higher than the tertiary. So the major is 4, the secondary is 5, leading to 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is noted but doesn't affect the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure the JSON is valid, no nested structures, and only the most severe lesion is considered. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason 4+5=9. That should cover all fields correctly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
