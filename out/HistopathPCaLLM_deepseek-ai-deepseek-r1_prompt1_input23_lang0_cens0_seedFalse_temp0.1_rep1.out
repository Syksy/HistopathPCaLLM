Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so I need to map that to the allowed values. "Prostatectomy" usually refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The conclusion says "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components here are grades 4 and 5. The primary (major) is 4 (60%), secondary (minor) is 5 (30%), and tertiary is 3 but it's the smallest. However, according to Gleason grading rules, if the highest grade is present, even as a tertiary, it might adjust the score. But in this case, the conclusion states sum 9, which would be 4 + 5 = 9. The tertiary grade 3 is not included in the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. The main components are 4 and 5, leading to sum 9. The tertiary is 3 but it's the least, so it doesn't affect the sum here. The conclusion confirms sum 9. So the correct format is "4+5=9".
