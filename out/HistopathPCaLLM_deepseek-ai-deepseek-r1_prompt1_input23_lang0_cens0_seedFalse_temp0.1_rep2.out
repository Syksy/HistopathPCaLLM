Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it starts with "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate..." Prostatectomy usually refers to RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components here are grade 4 and 5. The primary (major) is 4 (60%), secondary (minor) is 5 (30%), and tertiary is 3 but it's the smallest. However, according to grading rules, if there's a tertiary higher grade, sometimes it's incorporated, but the sum here is given as 9. The highest grades are 4 and 5. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9" since the sum is 9. The mention of grade group 5 aligns with the sum 9. 

Wait, the example uses major and minor, but in cases where there are tertiary patterns, sometimes the highest grades are considered. But the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report says the main is 4 (60%), second is 5 (30%). So major is 4, minor is 5, sum 9. So the correct format is "4+5=9".

I need to make sure that the structured fields don't have nested structures and only take the most severe. The tertiary grade 3 is smaller, so it's not included. The conclusion clearly states sum 9, so that's the key part.
