Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be RP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the summary states "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." The required format is major+minor=sum. The primary pattern is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. However, according to Gleason grading rules, the tertiary pattern is only considered if it's higher than the secondary. Here, tertiary is 3, which is lower than 5, so it's ignored. The main grades are 4 and 5, but the sum is 4+5=9. Wait, but the order might matter. Typically, the higher grade is listed first if present. Since the major is 4 (60%) and secondary is 5 (30%), but in Gleason scoring, when there's a tertiary higher grade, it can affect the grouping. However, in this case, the tertiary is lower. The summary directly states the sum is 9, which would be 4+5=9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9.
