Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." The word "prostatektomiapreparaati" translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which means adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). There's no ambiguity here since adenocarcinoma is cancerous.

Now, the Gleason score. The example given in the instructions uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." But looking at the details: the main grade is 4 (60%), the next is 5 (30%), and a tertiary 3. However, Gleason scoring typically takes the two most predominant grades. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, the primary is 4 and secondary is 5. So the sum is 4+5=9. The user wants the major and minor components, not the tertiary. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

Wait, but the report mentions "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." That summary confirms the sum is 9, which aligns with 4+5. The tertiary grade 3 is not included in the sum. So the correct format is "4+5=9."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. Let me double-check each part to make sure I didn't miss anything. The sample is from a prostatectomy, definitely RP. Adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. The Gleason components are 4 and 5, sum 9. Tertiary is ignored. Yep, that's correct.
