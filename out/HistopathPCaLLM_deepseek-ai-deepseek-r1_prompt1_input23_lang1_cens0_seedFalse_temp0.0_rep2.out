Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (which I know stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaati" translates to prostatectomy specimen. So, prostatectomy would be RP. Therefore, Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So, there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Clearly, the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the instructions say to report the worst (pahimman) lesion in the format "major+minor=sum". The summary at the end states "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." However, the detailed breakdown mentions the major component as grade 4 (60%), the next as grade 5 (30%), and a tertiary grade 3. But according to Gleason scoring rules, the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns are the two most prevalent, even if the tertiary is higher. Wait, but in some cases, if there's a tertiary higher grade, like in prostatectomy specimens, they might adjust. Wait, the current Gleason system for prostatectomy might consider the highest grade even if it's tertiary. Let me check. 

In the latest grading, when there are three patterns, the primary is the most common, the secondary is the next, but if the tertiary is higher than the secondary, some guidelines take the highest grade as the secondary. For example, if the patterns are 4 (60%), 5 (30%), and 3 (10%), the Gleason score would be 4 + 5 = 9. The tertiary grade 3 is the lowest here, so it doesn't affect the sum. The summary also confirms the sum is 9, so the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostatectomy specimen)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 4+5=9 (as per the summary and the components mentioned)

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
