Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista käynnistetyistä leikkeistä". The term "prostatektomiapreparaati" translates to prostatectomy specimen. In medical terms, RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5". However, we need to look for the major and minor components. The report says the primary pattern is 4 (60%), the secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary is 3. But according to Gleason grading rules, the tertiary pattern isn't added to the sum if it's lower. The primary and secondary are 4 and 5, so the sum is 4+5=9. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst (highest) lesion. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but not included in the sum, so it's ignored. Also, checking for any other possible issues like sample type abbreviations. Since prostatektomiapreparaatti is RP, that's correct. Malignancy is confirmed with adenocarcinoma. Gleason is correctly formatted as major plus minor equals sum.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
