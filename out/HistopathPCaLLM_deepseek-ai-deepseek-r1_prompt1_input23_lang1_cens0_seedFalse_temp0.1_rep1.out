Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." which translates to "From the prostatectomy specimen received as a sample..." Prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a prostatectomy specimen. So RP is the correct sample type here. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä."

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The example given was "4+3=7". The text states "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." However, I need to check if there's a breakdown of the major and minor components. Earlier in the report, it says the main class is 4 (60%), the second most common is 5 (30%), and tertiary is 3. According to Gleason scoring guidelines, the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns are the two most prevalent. Tertiary is only considered in certain cases. Here, the primary is 4 and secondary is 5, so the sum is 4+5=9. The tertiary 3 is not included in the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. Let me double-check the original text to ensure I didn't miss anything. Yes, the summary clearly states Gleason sum 9, and the components are 4 and 5. The tertiary 3 is mentioned but doesn't affect the sum. All right, that should be correct.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
