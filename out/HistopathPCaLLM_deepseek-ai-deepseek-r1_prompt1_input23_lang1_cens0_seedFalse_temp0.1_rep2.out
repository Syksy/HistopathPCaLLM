Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type here is RP.

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the instruction says to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The summary states "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." However, the detailed description mentions the primary pattern is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. But according to Gleason grading, the score is the sum of the primary and the highest secondary pattern. Here, primary is 4, secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The tertiary (3) isn't counted in the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Need to make sure there are no nested structures. All values are correctly filled. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. That should be the JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
