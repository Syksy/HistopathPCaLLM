Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näytesetistä" which translates to "from the sample set." There's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about taking additional samples and focusing on the apex, but the original sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. However, Gleason 3 is typically associated with a lower grade, and the current summary suggests re-examining to validate the initial suspicion. There's no explicit mention of malignancy in the current sample, only a suspicion. Since the current report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here would be "ei" (no) or maybe NA. Wait, but the previous report had Gleason 3, which is part of the grading system. However, the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed yet. The task says to report based on the current sample. Since the current summary doesn't state malignancy, but the previous had Gleason 3, which is part of a cancer diagnosis. Hmm, maybe I need to check if the current sample has malignancy. The text says they need to re-process the sample to validate the initial suspicion. So the current sample's findings aren't confirming malignancy yet. Therefore, Malignancy would be "ei" (no) because the current sample hasn't confirmed it, and they need to re-examine. Alternatively, if the previous report's Gleason 3 is considered part of the current case, but the task says to report the worst lesion from the current sample. Since the current sample's processing is incomplete and they need to focus on the apex again, maybe the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. So Malignancy is "ei" or NA? The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the current sample's results are pending re-processing, maybe NA is more appropriate. Wait, the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion results should be returned). But in this case, the current sample's findings are not conclusive, and they need to re-process. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample's summary doesn't state any malignancy, just that they need to validate the suspicion. So Malignancy would be "ei" because the current sample's analysis isn't confirming malignancy yet. Or maybe NA? The problem is that the current sample's processing is incomplete. The user instruction says to process the given lausunto (report), which is the current one. The current report's YHTEENVETO says they need to re-process to validate the suspicion. So the current sample's findings don't confirm malignancy, hence Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, since the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, the Gleason would be NA. However, the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample's processing is incomplete, and they need to re-examine. So the Gleason here would be NA because the current sample's analysis isn't final, and the malignancy isn't confirmed. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in current sample), and Gleason is NA (since no malignancy, no Gleason reported here).
