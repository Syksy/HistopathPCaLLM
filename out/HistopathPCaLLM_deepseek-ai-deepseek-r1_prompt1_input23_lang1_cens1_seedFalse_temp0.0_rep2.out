Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näytesetistä" which translates to a set of samples. The text also refers to a previous report on "apeksinäytteistä" (apex samples), but the current sample is from the central area and apex. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the original sample type isn't specified here, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions that the previous report on apex samples noted Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant. However, the current summary says they need to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. The current sample's findings aren't explicitly stated as malignant, but there's a suspicion. But since the current report doesn't confirm malignancy, only a previous mention, maybe the answer here is "ei" (no) or NA. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The current sample's results aren't clear, but the previous apex samples had Gleason 3. However, the current sample is from the central area and apex, but the summary says they need to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. Since the current sample's analysis isn't conclusive, and the malignancy isn't confirmed here, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the previous report had Gleason 3, which is part of a score, but Gleason 3+3=6 is considered low-grade cancer. However, the current sample's findings aren't stated. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. But in this case, the current sample's analysis isn't completed, and they need to re-process. So maybe the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, hence Malignancy is "ei"? Or is the previous mention enough? The instructions say to process the given input, which is this report. The report mentions a previous finding of Gleason 3, but the current sample's results are not yet confirmed. The summary says they need to re-process to validate the suspicion. So the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed, so Malignancy should be "ei" or NA. But the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the current sample's analysis is inconclusive and requires reprocessing, maybe Malignancy is NA. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). The current sample's analysis isn't complete, so maybe the answer is NA. But the previous report had Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample is from the central area and apex, but they need to focus on apex again. So the current sample's findings aren't reported as malignant yet. Therefore, Malignancy would be "ei" or NA. Since the current sample's results are pending, maybe NA is appropriate here. But the options for Malignancy are kyllä, ei, NA. If the sample is being reprocessed and the original suspicion is to be validated, but no current findings are reported, then perhaps Malignancy is NA. Alternatively, if the previous Gleason 3 is considered, but that's from a different sample. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample's processing is incomplete and requires re-examination, there's no confirmed malignancy yet. So Malignancy would be "ei" or NA. Hmm. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, the current report doesn't state any malignancy in the sample, just a need to re-examine. So Malignancy is "ei" or NA. The options for Malignancy are "kyllä", "ei", "NA". If the sample hasn't been fully processed yet and the results are pending, maybe NA is correct. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample hasn't been fully analyzed, then the answer might be NA. However, the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample. So in the current sample, no malignancy is found yet, so "ei". But the text says "YHTEENVETO: Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen siten, että keskitytään apeksiin, jotta voidaan validoida alkuperäinen suspisio." So the original suspicion (from the previous report) needs validation. The current sample's processing is incomplete. Therefore, the current sample's findings are not confirming malignancy yet, so Malignancy is "ei". But maybe the answer is NA because the sample hasn't been fully processed. This is a bit ambiguous. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. Here, the current sample's processing is incomplete, so perhaps the malignancy is not determined yet, hence NA.

Third, Gleason score. The previous report mentioned Gleason grade 3, but the current sample's analysis is not complete. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's Gleason for malignant cases. Since the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed, and the previous report's findings are from a different sample, the Gleason here would be NA. Because the current sample doesn't have a confirmed malignancy, so Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:
Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't specified)
Malignancy: NA (since the current sample's results are pending) or "ei" (if considering that no malignancy was found in the current processing). But the text doesn't state any malignancy in the current sample, just a need to re-examine. So maybe Malignancy is "ei"?
Wait, the options for Malignancy are "kyllä", "ei", "NA". If the sample is being reprocessed and the original suspicion is to be validated, but the current sample's analysis isn't complete, then perhaps the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was found in the current processing, but they need to check again. Alternatively, if the sample hasn't been fully analyzed yet, maybe NA is better. But according to the problem statement, the answer should be based on the given lausunto. The lausunto doesn't mention any malignant findings in the current sample, only a previous report. So Malignancy is "ei" because the current sample's analysis (as far as processed) doesn't show malignancy, but they need to redo it. Or maybe NA because the sample is being reprocessed and the result isn't available. This is a bit tricky. The example in the problem had a clear "kyllä" when malignancy was present. Here, since the current sample's processing is incomplete and requires re-examination, perhaps the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei" or NA. The problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion's results should be returned). If there are no lesions found in the current sample, then Malignancy is "ei". But if the sample hasn't been fully examined, maybe NA. However, the text says "YHTEENVETO: Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen..." which implies that the current processing didn't find enough, so they need to focus on the apex. So in the current sample, no malignancy found yet, hence "ei". But the previous report had Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample. So the current sample's Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

So the final answer would be:
Sampletype: NA
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA
