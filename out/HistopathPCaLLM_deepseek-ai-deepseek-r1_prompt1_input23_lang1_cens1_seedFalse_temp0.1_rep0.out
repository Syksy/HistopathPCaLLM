Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytesetistä" which translates to "from the sample set". The original report mentions that the previous report on the apex samples noted Gleason grade 3 findings. However, the current sample is being reprocessed to focus on the apex to validate the initial suspicion. There's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the text refers to taking additional samples from a prepared set and reprocessing, but doesn't specify the type, I think the safest answer here is "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason grade 3 is typically associated with less aggressive cancer, but still malignant. However, the current sample's findings aren't explicitly stated here. The summary says they need to reprocess the sample to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion was likely malignancy given the Gleason 3 mention, but the current sample's results aren't confirmed yet. Since the current report doesn't state any malignancy findings directly, maybe the malignancy status here is "NA" because it's pending validation. But wait, the previous report did mention Gleason 3, which is part of the current context. However, the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current sample is being reprocessed and the previous had Gleason 3, but the current text doesn't state new findings, maybe malignancy is "kyllä" based on the previous mention. But the task says to process the given lausunto (statement), which is the current report. The current report's YHTEENVETO (summary) says to reprocess to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion was probably malignancy, but the current sample hasn't confirmed it yet. So maybe malignancy is "ei" or "NA". Hmm. The previous report had Gleason 3, which is cancer, but the current sample's findings aren't stated. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the current sample's processing hasn't found anything yet but refers to a previous report, should we consider the previous findings? The current report's task is to focus on the apex to validate the suspicion. Since the current sample's results are pending, maybe malignancy is "NA". Alternatively, if the previous report's findings are considered part of the current context, maybe "kyllä". But the user says "näytteessä" (in the sample), so the current sample's findings. Since the current sample is being reprocessed and the original suspicion is to be validated, but no malignancy is confirmed here, perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if the mention of Gleason 3 in the previous report is part of the current sample's context, maybe "kyllä". But the current sample's own findings aren't stated as malignant. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given. In the example, the sample was a biopsy, and malignancy was "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma was found. Here, the current sample's processing is incomplete, and they need to reprocess. So maybe the malignancy here is "NA" because the current sample hasn't confirmed it yet, even though there's a previous suspicion.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text mentions that the previous report on the apex samples noted Gleason grade 3. But the current sample's Gleason isn't provided. The task says to report the Gleason for malignant findings. Since the current sample's malignancy status is unclear (maybe "NA"), the Gleason would also be "NA". However, if the previous Gleason 3 is considered part of the current context, but the current sample hasn't confirmed it, then maybe Gleason is "NA". The example included the Gleason from the current sample. Here, the current sample's processing is not yet done, so no Gleason is reported. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't specified)
Malignancy: NA (current sample's findings pending, previous mentioned but not confirmed here)
Gleason: NA (no current Gleason reported)
