Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näytesetistä" which translates to a set of samples. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about taking additional samples from the apex, but the original sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. However, the current summary says they need to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. Since Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant, but the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed yet. The previous report had grade 3, which is typically considered less aggressive but still malignant. But the current sample's result isn't explicitly stated here. Wait, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. The current text mentions that the previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample is being re-examined. Since the current summary doesn't confirm malignancy in this sample, maybe the malignancy is still under investigation. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says they need to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion was probably malignancy, but the current sample's result isn't clear. However, the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is part of a cancer diagnosis. But the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed yet. The user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. If the current sample's findings are inconclusive but there's a previous mention, does that count? Wait, the current sample's data is what's being processed. The text is about a sample that needs to be re-handled to validate the original suspicion. So maybe the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, Malignancy could be "ei" or "NA". But the previous report (from apex samples) had Gleason 3. However, the current sample's summary doesn't state any malignancy, just that they need to re-examine. So perhaps the answer here is "ei" because the current sample's analysis isn't confirming malignancy yet, or "NA" because it's pending. But according to the instructions, we need to extract from the given text. The given text's YHTEENVETO says to process the sample again focusing on the apex to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion was likely malignancy, but the current sample's result isn't stated. So the malignancy field here would be "ei" if no malignancy is found, but the text doesn't explicitly say that. Alternatively, since the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex), maybe the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. The user instruction says to report the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample's data doesn't mention any malignancy, but refers to a previous one, perhaps the answer here is "ei" or "NA". Hmm. The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when the current sample has findings. Here, the current sample's findings are not conclusive, and they need to re-examine. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" or "NA". The problem states that if there are no malignant findings, use "ei". If it's not mentioned, maybe "NA". But the text doesn't explicitly say whether malignancy was found in the current sample. The previous report had Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample. So in the current sample, the malignancy isn't confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? The problem's example uses "kyllä" when the sample has findings. Here, the current sample's findings are not clear. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the current sample doesn't have any malignancy reported, then Malignancy would be "ei". But the text says they need to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. So maybe the current sample's analysis didn't find malignancy, hence needing to redo. So Malignancy: "ei". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the sample is being re-examined because the initial was inconclusive, maybe the malignancy is not determined yet, hence "NA". The problem's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results) should be reported. If the current sample's analysis didn't find any malignancy, then "ei". If the analysis isn't done yet, then "NA". The text says "YHTEENVETO: Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen..." meaning the sample needs to be reprocessed. So perhaps the current analysis didn't find malignancy, leading them to re-examine. So Malignancy: "ei". But the previous report had Gleason 3, which is part of a cancer diagnosis, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample is from the base (basikseen) and they need to focus on apex. So the current sample's analysis might not have found malignancy, hence "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but that's from a different sample (apex). The current sample's Gleason isn't reported. Since the malignancy is "ei" or "NA", the Gleason would be "NA". But if Malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason would be reported. But in this case, if Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in current sample), Gleason is "NA".
