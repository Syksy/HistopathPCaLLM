Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to prostate biopsy, hence "biopsy". In the current case, the input text says "Osia valmistellusta näytesetistä otetaan lisätutkimuksiin" which refers to parts of a prepared sample set. There's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The mention of "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä" suggests previous samples from the apex, but the current sample's origin isn't specified. So Sampletype is likely "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text refers to "suspisio" (suspicion) and mentions that previous apex samples had Gleason 3. However, the current summary doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The previous report noted Gleason 3, which is typically associated with cancer, but the current text is about re-examining to validate suspicion. Since there's no confirmation here, maybe "kyllä" because Gleason 3 is cancer, but wait—Gleason 3+3 is considered low-grade cancer. However, the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed yet. The task says to report the worst lesion's results. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but the current sample's findings aren't stated. Hmm. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion in the current sample. Since the current text is about re-processing to validate, maybe the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the example had "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, the summary says they need to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. So the current sample's results aren't conclusive yet. Therefore, malignancy might be "ei" or "NA". But the previous report had Gleason 3, which is cancer. However, the current sample's data might not have malignancy. Since the task is about the current sample's data, not previous, and the current text doesn't state malignancy, maybe "NA" or "ei". But the example used "kyllä" when cancer was present. Here, the current sample's result isn't clear. The user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which I think refers to the worst lesion in the sample being processed. Since the current sample is being reprocessed to validate, but the text doesn't state any malignancy found in this sample yet, maybe the answer is "ei" or "NA". But the previous report had Gleason 3, which is cancer. Wait, the current sample's summary is about needing to reprocess to validate the suspicion. So maybe the current sample's findings are not yet confirmed, hence malignancy is "NA"? Or does the mention of previous Gleason 3 imply that malignancy is present? The task says to report based on the current sample's data. Since the current text doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps "ei" or "NA". But the example included "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, the current sample's report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, only that they need to reprocess. So maybe "NA" for malignancy.

Third, Gleason. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but the current sample's Gleason isn't given. The task says to report Gleason only if malignancy is present. If malignancy is "ei" or "NA", then Gleason is "NA". Since in this case, the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so "NA". Malignancy isn't confirmed in the current sample, so "NA". Gleason is "NA".
