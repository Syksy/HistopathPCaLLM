Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the example includes both the individual grades and the sum, like "4+3=7". Here, the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't explicitly given. Wait, the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If it's Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, maybe it's 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. However, the summary says "sum 8", so even if the individual grades aren't mentioned, the correct format would be "4+4=8" assuming both are 4. But the user's example used the exact numbers from the text. Since the text mentions Gleason 4 and the sum is 8, perhaps the other grade is 4. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text provides both grades. The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" but the summary says sum 8. Maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, leading to sum 8. So the correct format would be "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the text only mentions Gleason 4 but the sum is 8, maybe the other grade is inferred. But according to the instructions, the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. Since the sum is 8 and the only grade mentioned is 4, perhaps the other is 4. So I'll go with "4+4=8".
