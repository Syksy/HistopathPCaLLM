Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the example includes both the individual grades and the sum. The problem is the input text only mentions the sum, not the individual grades. But the allowed values prefer "major+minor=sum". Wait, the user's example had "4+3=7" from the text that mentioned grades 4 and 3. Here, the text only says "sum 8". So maybe the individual grades aren't provided. But the instructions say to use "major+minor=sum" as the format. If the individual grades aren't specified, can we still report the sum? The example allows "NA" for benign, but this is malignant. The user might expect "NA" if the individual grades aren't present, but the text does mention "sum 8". Hmm. The instruction says "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum, but if only the sum is given, maybe we can just put "8" or "sum 8". Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. But the example shows "4+3=7". So maybe the correct way here is that if the sum is given but not the individual grades, we can't construct the major+minor part. But the user's example includes the sum from the individual grades. However, in the given input, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The original text also mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". Wait, "Gleason 4" might refer to the primary grade. If the primary is 4 and the sum is 8, then the secondary would be 4 (4+4=8). But is that a valid assumption? The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50% of the chippings. Then the summary says sum 8. So maybe the primary is 4 and secondary is 4, leading to 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. However, the user's instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 8 and the major is 4, then minor would be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor grade. However, in the example, the user included the sum even when the text had both grades. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4 (major) and sum 8, so minor would be 4. So maybe it's safe to put "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the minor isn't mentioned, should we put "NA"? But the example shows that even if the text says "resulting in a sum of 4+3=7", the output is "4+3=7". So in this case, the text says "sum 8", but the major is 4. So perhaps the correct format is "4+4=8". But the user's instruction says "preferably" in that format. Alternatively, if the individual grades aren't given, maybe it's "NA", but the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. However, the allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". So if the individual grades aren't specified, but the sum is, do we have to put "NA"? That's a bit conflicting. The example includes both grades and sum. But in the given input, the sum is provided, and the major is mentioned as 4. So maybe the minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text explicitly states both grades. The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" which is the major, and the summary says sum 8. So the minor must be 4. So the answer would be "4+4=8". But I need to be careful here. If the text only mentions the major and the sum, can we infer the minor? The user's example had both grades mentioned. Here, the major is 4, sum is 8, so minor is 4. So I think it's safe to put "4+4=8". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (from "turp-chippings")

Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)

Gleason: 4+4=8 (since major is 4 and sum is 8)

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
