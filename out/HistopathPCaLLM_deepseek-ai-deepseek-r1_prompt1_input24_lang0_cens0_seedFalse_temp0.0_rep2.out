Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the example includes both the individual grades and the sum, like "4+3=7". Here, the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't explicitly given. Wait, the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If it's Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, maybe it's 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. However, the summary says "sum 8", so even if the individual grades aren't mentioned, the correct format would be "4+4=8" assuming both are 4. But the user's example used the exact numbers from the text. Since the text mentions "Gleason 4" and the sum is 8, perhaps the other grade is also 4. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the example required both major and minor grades. If the text only mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, maybe the minor is 4 as well. Alternatively, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. So the sum is 8. So the correct format would be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The summary mentions the sum 8, which is the highest mentioned, so that's the one to use.
