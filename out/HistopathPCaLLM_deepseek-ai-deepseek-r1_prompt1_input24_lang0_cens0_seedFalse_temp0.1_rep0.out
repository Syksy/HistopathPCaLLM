Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and understand exactly what they want. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text medical report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I have to make sure each field adheres to those.

Starting with the first field: Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here is TURP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "malignant suspicion" and later states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The example given was "4+3=7". In the provided statement, it says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the exact major and minor grades aren't explicitly stated. Wait, earlier in the text, it mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If the sum is 8, and one of the grades is 4, then the other must be 4 as well (since 4+4=8). But I need to check if the text specifies both grades. Let me re-read the statement. It says "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So the major and minor might both be 4, but the text doesn't explicitly state both. However, the sum is given as 8, and since Gleason 4 is mentioned, perhaps the other component is also 4. But the user's example used "4+3=7" where both grades were mentioned. Here, only one grade is mentioned, but the sum is 8. Should I infer that it's 4+4=8? The problem says to use the most severe lesion. Since the sum is 8 and the highest Gleason grade is 5, but here it's 4. Wait, no, Gleason grades go up to 5. Wait, but the sum can be up to 10 (5+5). If the sum is 8, the possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. But in the text, they mention Gleason 4-class tumor growth. So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, making 8. But the text doesn't explicitly say both. However, the summary states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Since the user example used the sum even when the individual grades were mentioned, perhaps here, even if the individual grades aren't both stated, we can use the sum. But the user's instruction says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". So if the individual grades aren't provided, but the sum is, should we just put "sum 8"? But the example included both. Hmm. Wait, the example had "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7", so the structured data was "4+3=7". In the current case, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and "sum 8". So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, but the text doesn't explicitly state that. However, the summary says "sum 8". The user might want us to report the sum even if the individual grades aren't both specified. But according to the instructions, the Gleason field should be "major+minor=sum" if possible. If the individual grades aren't given, but the sum is, maybe we should still put "4+4=8" assuming that's the case. But is that a safe assumption? Alternatively, if the text only mentions Gleason 4 but the sum is 8, perhaps the other grade is 4. However, without explicit mention, maybe we should just put "sum 8". But the example uses the format with both grades. Wait, the user's example had both grades mentioned, so they were able to structure it as "4+3=7". In the current case, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and "sum 8". So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, but the problem is that the text doesn't explicitly state both. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The user's instruction says to take the most severe lesion. If the sum is 8, that's the most severe part. But how to structure it? The user's example used the individual grades when available. Here, only one grade is mentioned (4), but the sum is 8. So perhaps the correct approach is to report "4+4=8" since that's the only way to get sum 8 with a known grade of 4. Alternatively, if the other grade isn't mentioned, maybe we should just put "sum 8". But the user's example required both grades. The instructions say "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". So if possible, use that format. If the individual grades aren't provided, but the sum is, perhaps we can still use "sum=8", but the example shows including the individual grades. However, in this case, the text doesn't specify both grades. So maybe the answer should be "4+4=8" because the sum is 8 and one grade is 4. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects "sum 8" but the example shows including the individual grades. Wait, the example's input had both grades mentioned, so the output included them. Here, the input mentions Gleason 4 and sum 8. So perhaps the other grade is 4. But maybe the other grade is 5? Wait, no, because 4+5 would be 9. The sum is 8. So 4+4=8 or 5+3=8. But the text mentions Gleason 4, so maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason field would be "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state both. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8" even if not explicitly stated. Alternatively, if the user requires that both grades are mentioned, then maybe it's NA. But that's unlikely. The user's example used the sum even when the individual grades were present. So in this case, since the sum is given, even if the individual grades aren't both mentioned, we can use the sum. Wait, but the example included both. Hmm. The user's instructions say "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements". So if the individual grades are not provided, but the sum is, should we just put the sum? But the example shows that when both are provided, they are structured as "4+3=7". If only the sum is provided, perhaps the answer should be "sum 8", but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" as in the example. So if the sum is given but not the individual grades, perhaps we can't structure it as per the preferred format. But in the given example, the sum is derived from the individual grades. Here, the sum is given directly. So maybe the answer should be "sum 8", but the preferred format is "4+4=8". However, the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. So perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8" based on the sum and the mentioned Gleason 4. Alternatively, if the user expects only the sum when individual grades aren't provided, but the example shows that when both are present, they are used. But in this case, the user's instruction says "preferably" which implies that if possible, use the major+minor=sum, otherwise maybe just the sum. But the allowed values don't include just the sum. Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. So if the sum is provided but not the individual grades, perhaps we have to put "NA"? But that doesn't make sense because the example shows that when the sum is derived from the grades, it's structured. Here, the sum is given directly. Wait, the text says "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So the sum is explicitly stated. But the individual grades are not. However, earlier in the text, it mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". So perhaps the major grade is 4, and the minor is 4, leading to sum 8. But the text doesn't explicitly state both. So maybe the answer is "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the user requires both grades to be explicitly mentioned, then perhaps the answer is "NA", but that's unlikely because the sum is given. The user's example included both grades, but in this case, the sum is given directly, and one grade is mentioned. So perhaps the answer is "4+4=8" based on the available information. Alternatively, maybe the other grade is 5, but that would make the sum 9. So no. Therefore, the safest assumption is that both grades are 4. So the Gleason field would be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (from "turp-chippings").

Malignancy is yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant).

Gleason is "4+4=8" (since sum is 8 and one grade is 4, assuming the other is 4).
