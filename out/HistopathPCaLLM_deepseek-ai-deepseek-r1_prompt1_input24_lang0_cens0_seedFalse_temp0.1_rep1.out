Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The input mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the exact grades (like 4+4 or 5+3) aren't specified here. But the summary states "sum 8", so I need to represent that. Since the exact major and minor aren't given, maybe the best way is to put "4+4=8" because Gleason 4+4 is a common combination for sum 8. Wait, but the text earlier mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If the major and minor are both 4, then 4+4=8. But the summary just says sum 8. However, the user prefers the format "major+minor=sum". Since the exact grades aren't provided, but the sum is 8, maybe we can infer that it's 4+4=8 based on the mention of Gleason 4 in the text. Alternatively, if the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, should it be NA? But the example shows that even if the sum is given, they use the format. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum provided. Wait, the example given in the problem statement uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3". So in this case, the input says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" but doesn't specify the individual grades. However, earlier in the text, it mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". So maybe the major is 4, and the minor is also 4, making 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. Hmm. The user's instruction says to report the Gleason grade preferably in "major+minor=sum" form. If the sum is given but the individual grades aren't, should we just put "sum 8" or try to infer? The example requires both grades. But in the given input, the summary says "sum 8", and the earlier part mentions Gleason 4. So maybe the major is 4, but the minor isn't stated. However, in Gleason scoring, the sum is the two most prevalent grades. If the sum is 8, and one of them is 4, the other would have to be 4 (since 4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe 5+3=8, but that's not possible because 5+3=8 is 8, but 3 is lower than 4. Wait, no, 5+3=8 is sum 8, but the highest grade is 5. But the text mentions Gleason 4. So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+4=8". But the user's example uses the exact grades mentioned. In the input, the summary says "sum 8", but the text mentions Gleason 4. So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, if the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified, should it be "NA"? But the example shows that even if the sum is derived from the grades, it's structured. However, in this case, the sum is given directly. The user's instructions say to report the Gleason grade preferably in "major+minor=sum" form. If the individual grades aren't provided but the sum is, maybe we can't structure it as "major+minor=sum". But the example in the problem statement includes a case where the sum is derived from the grades. Here, the input says "sum 8", but the individual grades aren't explicitly stated. However, earlier in the text, it mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might indicate that the major component is 4. If the sum is 8, then the minor would have to be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the minor is 5 (4+5=9, which is sum 9, but that's not the case here). Wait, the sum is 8. So if major is 4, minor must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", and the user's example uses the sum even if it's derived. So perhaps in this case, even though the individual grades aren't explicitly stated, the sum is given, and the major is inferred from the mention of Gleason 4. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+4=8". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8.
