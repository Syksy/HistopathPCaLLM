Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type should be "TURP". The example uses lowercase, but the allowed values are in uppercase, so "TURP" is correct.

Next, checking for malignancy. The summary states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the summary mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The format requested is "major+minor=sum". However, the text doesn't explicitly state the individual grades (like 4+4=8 or 5+3=8). But the example uses "4+3=7" when the sum is given. Here, the summary says "sum 8", so the Gleason field should be "4+4=8" assuming both major and minor are 4. Wait, but the text earlier mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If the major is 4 and minor is 4, that adds up to 8. Alternatively, maybe it's 5+3=8? But the text doesn't specify. However, the example uses the exact sum mentioned in the text. The user instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" preferably. Since the text only states "sum 8", maybe we should put "sum 8" as the value. But the example shows including the individual grades. Hmm. Wait, the example input had "Gleason grades 4 and 3" leading to "4+3=7". In the current case, the text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". If the individual grades aren't specified, should we just put "8" or follow the format? The allowed values for Gleason preferably should be in "major+minor=sum" form. But if the individual grades aren't given, maybe we can't infer them. However, the example shows that even if the sum is given, they include the individual grades. Wait, the example input says "resulting in a sum of 4+3=7" and the output is "4+3=7". In the current case, the input says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So maybe the correct way is to just put "sum 8" but according to the example, the format is major+minor=sum. But since the input doesn't specify the individual grades, perhaps we can't determine them. However, in the text, there's a mention of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". If that's the major component, maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the minor is another grade. But the text doesn't specify. The user instruction says to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" if possible, but if not, maybe "NA"? But the example shows that even when the sum is given, they use the individual grades. However, in this case, the sum is given as 8, but the individual grades aren't explicitly stated. The text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might refer to the major pattern. If the sum is 8, then if major is 4, minor would be 4. So perhaps it's 4+4=8. But is that a safe assumption? Alternatively, maybe the report just states the sum without the components. The user's instructions say "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum, so if the components are not given, maybe we can just put the sum. But the example includes the components. Wait, in the example, the input text explicitly states the grades 4 and 3. So in this case, the input text says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" but doesn't mention the individual grades. However, earlier in the text, it says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". Maybe that's the major component. So if the sum is 8, and major is 4, then minor would be 4. So 4+4=8. Alternatively, maybe the minor is 5, but that's not stated. Since the example requires the format, perhaps we have to infer. But the user instruction says "preferably" so if the individual grades are not given, maybe we can't. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which is the total. But the allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". If the individual grades aren't specified, maybe we can't use the preferred format and have to put "NA". But that contradicts the example. Wait, in the example, the input text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so they can structure it as 4+3=7. Here, the input text says "sum 8", but the individual grades are not given. However, earlier in the text, there's "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". Maybe that's the major component. So if the major is 4, and the sum is 8, then minor would be 4 (4+4=8). But is that a valid assumption? The problem is that the user's instruction says to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" preferably. If the individual grades are not given, but the sum is, and there's a mention of a specific grade (like 4 here), perhaps we can infer. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be "sum 8" but the example shows that the format is with the individual grades. But the user might expect that if the sum is given but the individual grades are not, we can't structure it as "major+minor=sum". However, in the given text, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which is the total. The example uses the individual grades when they are provided. Here, the individual grades are not provided, but the sum is. So perhaps the correct answer is to put "8" but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, maybe we have to put "NA" here. But that doesn't make sense because the sum is known. Alternatively, perhaps the answer should be "sum=8" but the example uses "4+3=7". Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" as in the example. If the individual grades are not specified, but the sum is, then maybe we can't use the preferred format and have to put "NA". But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the individual grades are not, we can structure it as "sum=8". But the example uses the individual grades. The problem is that the user's instruction says "preferably" in the form of "major+minor=sum". So if the individual grades are not available, but the sum is, maybe we can just put the sum as "8". But the example shows that when the sum is given with the individual grades, they structure it as "4+3=7". So perhaps in this case, since the sum is given but the individual grades are not explicitly stated, we can't structure it in the preferred format and have to put "NA". However, the text does mention "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might be the major component. If the sum is 8, then major is 4 and minor is 4. So 4+4=8. But is that a valid assumption? The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" in over 50% of the chippings, which would be the major component. Then the minor component would be another grade that adds up to 8. If major is 4, then minor would be 4 (4+4=8). So maybe that's the case. Therefore, the Gleason grade would be "4+4=8". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP.

Malignancy is yes.

Gleason is 4+4=8.
