Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". "Turp" here likely refers to TURP, which stands for transurethral resection of the prostate. So the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and "adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma), which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which translates to a total score of 8. However, the example requires the major and minor components. The report also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". But since the summary says the total is 8, we need to figure out the components. Typically, Gleason scores are the sum of the two most common patterns. If the total is 8, possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. However, the text mentions "Gleason 4" as the tumor growth, which might be the major component. If the total is 8, then 4+4=8. But the example uses "4+3=7", so the format is major + minor = sum. Here, the summary says "pistesumman 8", so the components might be 4+4=8. However, the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which could imply that the major component is 4. If the total is 8, then minor would be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe there's a mention of another component. Wait, the text says "adenokarsinoomaksi" with a total of 8. Since the example uses the exact numbers from the text, here the user might expect the sum 8, but the components aren't explicitly given. However, the example includes both components even if the text only mentions one. In the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so they take both. Here, the text only mentions Gleason 4, but the total is 8. So perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4, making 4+4=8. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing component. But since the summary states the total is 8, and the only Gleason mentioned is 4, perhaps the other component is 4. So the Gleason would be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the example requires both major and minor components. If the text only mentions one, but the total is given, maybe we have to infer. However, the user instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. If the components aren't specified, but the sum is, maybe we can't fill it. But in this case, the text says "pistesumman 8", which is the sum. However, the example shows that even if the sum is derived from the components, they are included. Here, the problem is that the components aren't explicitly stated. The text mentions "Gleason 4" but the sum is 8. So perhaps the other component is 4 (4+4=8) or maybe 5+3. But without explicit mention, should we default to the sum? The user's example includes both components even when the text says "4 ja 3". So in this case, the text says "Gleason 4" and sum 8, but maybe the other component is 4. Alternatively, maybe the report is considering the primary pattern as 4 and secondary as 4. But since the user's instructions say to take the worst lesion's results, perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4. However, another part of the text says "YHTEENVETO: ... pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". The summary might be the key here. If the total is 8, but the components aren't specified, how to proceed? The example requires the format with major and minor. If the components aren't given, perhaps we can't fill it, but the user's instructions say to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So maybe the worst lesion's Gleason is 4+4=8. Alternatively, maybe the components are 5+3, but the text doesn't say. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. But since the example uses the exact numbers from the text, even if the sum is derived, perhaps here we should use the sum as given, even if the components aren't explicitly stated. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7", so they have both components. In our case, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and sum 8. But how to get the components? If the sum is 8 and one component is 4, the other must be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the primary is 4 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. However, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. Since the user requires the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format, and the components are not given, but the sum is, perhaps we can only report the sum. But the example shows that even if the sum is derived from components, they are included. So maybe in this case, since the sum is 8 and the major component is 4 (as mentioned), the minor must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the text only mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, maybe there's a mistake. But according to the given data, we have to go with what's present. So I'll proceed with "4+4=8".
