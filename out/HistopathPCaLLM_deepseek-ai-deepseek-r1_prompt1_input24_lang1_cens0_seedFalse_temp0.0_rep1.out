Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the example and the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on varmistuksena ajettavaksi n. 10g turp-lastuja..." The term "turp" here likely refers to TURP, which stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Also, the summary states "malignin epäilyksen jättänyt höyläysnäyte" which confirms malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7". In the provided text, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". However, earlier it mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Wait, Gleason 4 is a component, but the total sum is 8. But how is that possible? Gleason scores are the sum of the two most prevalent grades. If the major is 4, then the minor would need to be 4 to sum to 8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. However, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which translates to "score of 8". But the correct format requires major and minor components. Since the report mentions Gleason 4 as the tumor growth, but the sum is 8, perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4? But that's unusual. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, the example in the problem uses "4+3=7" where the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". In the current case, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". If the sum is 8, and one component is 4, the other must be 4 (4+4=8). However, the example uses the two grades mentioned in the text. Here, the text only explicitly mentions Gleason 4. But the summary says the total is 8, so perhaps the major and minor are both 4. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, totaling 8. But the text doesn't mention the minor component. However, the summary states the total as 8. Since the user requires the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format, and the example uses the two components from the text, but here only one component (4) is mentioned, but the sum is 8. This is conflicting. Wait, maybe the original text in Finnish says "Gleason 4 -luokan" which is grade 4, but the total score is 8. But Gleason score is the sum of the two most common grades. If the primary is 4 and secondary is 4, sum is 8. But if the text only mentions grade 4, but the sum is 8, then perhaps the two components are 4 and 4. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo. But according to the user's instructions, we need to extract the reported Gleason. The example shows that when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", the output is "4+3=7". Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". So perhaps the correct Gleason is "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. However, the summary mentions the total score as 8, which would require the sum of two grades. Since the main grade mentioned is 4, and the total is 8, the other must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+4=8". But I need to check the original text again. The Finnish text says: "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and "YHTEENVETO: ... pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". So the summary gives the total score as 8, but the main text mentions Gleason 4. So the two components would be 4 and 4. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (from "turp-lastuja")
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
Gleason: 4+4=8 (sum is 8, major and minor both 4)

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
