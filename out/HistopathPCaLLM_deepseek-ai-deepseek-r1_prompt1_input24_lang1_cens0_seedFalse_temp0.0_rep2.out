Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and "adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma), which is a malignant tumor. So the malignancy field should be "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The report states "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which translates to a total score of 8. However, the example given in the problem uses the format with major and minor components. The text also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" (Gleason grade 4 tumor growth). Since the total is 8, and one component is 4, the other must be 4 as well (4+4=8). But wait, the example in the problem shows 4+3=7. So the correct format here would be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8. I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The mention of chronic inflammation doesn't affect the malignancy or Gleason score since the main finding is adenocarcinoma with Gleason 8.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
