Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so "TURP" should be the correct value here. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "biopsiasta", so applying similar logic here.

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. There's also a reference to "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and it's classified as "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". So clearly malignant. The answer here should be "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and later "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". Wait, Gleason 4 is mentioned, but the sum is 8. However, Gleason scores are the sum of the two most common patterns. If the major is 4, then the minor must be 4 as well (4+4=8). But the text might not explicitly state both numbers. The example given in the problem had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". Here, the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't both specified. However, the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor growth and the sum of 8 suggests that both patterns are 4. So "4+4=8" would be the correct format. But I need to check if the text provides both grades. The report says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and "pistesumman 8". It's possible that the major is 4 and minor is 4, but maybe the text doesn't explicitly state the minor. However, in the summary, it's stated as "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which is the total. Since the problem requires the format "major+minor=sum", and the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't both mentioned, but the main tumor is Gleason 4. Wait, maybe the report only mentions one grade. But in Gleason scoring, you need two grades. However, sometimes in reports, if both are the same, they might just mention one. But in this case, the user's example shows that when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", it's 4+3=7. Here, the text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and sum 8. So perhaps the primary pattern is 4 and secondary is 4, making 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly say both. However, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. Since the problem requires the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format, even if the text only mentions the sum, but in the example, they extracted both grades from the text. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So maybe the minor is 4 as well. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake. Wait, the example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. Here, the main tumor is Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So if the sum is 8, and the primary is 4, then the secondary must be 4 (4+4=8). Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+4=8". But does the text explicitly state both grades? The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and "pistesumman 8". It's possible that the secondary grade isn't mentioned, but the sum is given. However, according to the problem's instructions, we need to report the major and minor. If the sum is 8 and the major is 4, then minor must be 4. So even if the text doesn't explicitly state both, we can infer it from the sum. But the example required both grades to be mentioned. Wait, in the example, the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so both were present. Here, the text only mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So maybe the minor isn't mentioned. But the problem says to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. If the sum is given but the individual grades aren't, how to handle that? The problem's example uses the explicit grades from the text. Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and sum 8. So perhaps the major is 4, minor is 4, sum 8. Therefore, "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text provides both. The original text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and "YHTEENVETO: ... pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". So the summary gives the total score of 8, but the main tumor is Gleason 4. In Gleason scoring, the total is the sum of the most common and the second most common patterns. So if the total is 8 and the primary is 4, then the secondary must be 4. Therefore, even if the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade, we can infer it. However, the problem's instructions say to use the reported Gleason. If the text only mentions the sum, but not the individual grades, should we put "NA"? But in the example, the sum was derived from the two grades mentioned. Here, the sum is given, but the individual grades are only partially mentioned. Wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might refer to the primary pattern, and the sum is 8, so secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason would be "4+4=8". So I think that's the right approach here.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (since it's turp-lastuja).

Malignancy is "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma is malignant.

Gleason is "4+4=8" because the sum is 8 and the primary is 4.
