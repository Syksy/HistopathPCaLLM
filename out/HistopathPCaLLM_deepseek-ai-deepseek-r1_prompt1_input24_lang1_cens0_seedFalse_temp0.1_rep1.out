Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, so "turp" here likely refers to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Also, the summary states it was previously considered benign but now classified as malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which translates to a total score of 8. However, the example requires the major and minor components. Earlier in the text, it says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". But Gleason score is a sum of the two most common patterns. If the total is 8, and the major component is 4, then the minor must be 4 as well (4+4=8). However, sometimes the primary and secondary patterns might be different. Wait, the example given in the problem statement uses "4+3=7", so the format is major + minor = sum. In the provided text, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the main part mentions Gleason 4. If the total is 8, and the primary is 4, then the secondary would be 4 (4+4=8). However, the text doesn't explicitly state both grades. But in the YHTEENVETO (summary), it's stated as a total of 8. But maybe the original mention in the text is "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua", which might refer to the primary pattern. However, without explicit mention of the secondary pattern, can we assume it's 4? Or is there another part? Wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which is the total. But the problem requires the major and minor components. If the total is 8, and the primary is 4, then the secondary must be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state both. However, in the example, even though the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", the JSON uses "4+3=7". So here, if the total is 8 and the primary is 4, then the secondary is 4. So the Gleason would be "4+4=8".

But wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Gleason grading is based on the two most common patterns. If the primary is 4 and the secondary is 4, then the sum is 8. But maybe the report only mentions the primary here. However, the summary states the total is 8. So perhaps the secondary is also 4. Alternatively, maybe there's a mention of another grade elsewhere. Let me check the original text again.

The text says: "Lastuissa havaitaan >50%:ssa yhteensulaneina asinuksina kasvavaa Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua." So here, the tumor is Gleason grade 4. Then in the summary: "YHTEENVETO: Aiemmin benigniksi luokiteltu mutta malignin epäilyksen jättänyt höyläysnäyte arvioidaan uusiksi siis pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi." So the total is 8. Since the primary is 4, the secondary must be 4 (4+4=8). Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's turp-lastuja)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
Gleason: 4+4=8
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
