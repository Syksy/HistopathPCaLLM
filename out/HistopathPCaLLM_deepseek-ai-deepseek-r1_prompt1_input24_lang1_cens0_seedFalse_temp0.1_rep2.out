Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion's results should be included, and the JSON shouldn't have nested structures.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "turp-lastuja". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so "TURP" should be the sample type here. That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinooma", which is a malignant tumor. Also, the summary states that a previously benign sample is now classified as malignant. So the malignancy field should be "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which translates to a total score of 8. However, the example given in the problem uses the format with major and minor components. The report also mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" but doesn't explicitly state the major and minor patterns. Wait, in the summary, it's a total score of 8. But Gleason scores are typically the sum of the two most common patterns. If the total is 8, possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. However, the text mentions "Gleason 4" in the tumor growth. Maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4, making 4+4=8. But the example in the problem had both components specified. Since the text says "pistesumman 8" (total score 8) but doesn't specify the individual grades, is it acceptable to put "4+4=8" based on the mention of Gleason 4? Or is there a more accurate way?

Wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might indicate that the primary pattern is 4, but the total sum is 8. If the total is 8, and the primary is 4, then the secondary would be 4 (4+4=8). Alternatively, maybe the report only mentions the primary pattern as 4, but the total is 8, which could mean another pattern. However, without explicit mention of both grades, should I default to "4+4=8" since the total is 8 and the primary is 4? Or is there a risk of assuming incorrectly?

Looking back at the example given in the problem: the example text mentions "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so 4+3=7. The user's example uses the specific components. In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth, but the summary says total score 8. If the total is 8 and the primary is 4, then the secondary must be 4 (4+4=8). However, if the report doesn't explicitly state both components, should I still infer? The problem says to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't specified, maybe it's "NA"? But in the example, they were specified. Here, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the detailed part mentions Gleason 4. Maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4. Alternatively, maybe the report doesn't specify, so should I put "4+4=8" based on the total and the mentioned Gleason 4? Or is there a possibility that the minor component is higher, like 5? But without explicit mention, perhaps it's safer to use the total and the mentioned grade. However, the problem requires the format "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't given, maybe the answer should be "NA"? But that doesn't make sense because the example used the components even when the text said "summa 4+3=7". Wait, in the example, the text explicitly stated both components. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4 in the tumor growth, but the total is 8. So maybe the primary is 4 and secondary is 4. Therefore, "4+4=8". But I need to confirm if that's the correct approach. Since the problem states to take the worst lesion's results, and the summary mentions the total score of 8, which is the sum, but the components are not explicitly given. However, in the detailed part, it says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua", which might refer to the primary pattern. If the primary is 4 and the total is 8, then secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (from "turp-lastuja").

Malignancy is "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma is present.

Gleason is "4+4=8" based on the total score of 8 and the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor. Even though the components aren't explicitly stated as in the example, the mention of Gleason 4 in the tumor and the total of 8 allows us to infer that it's 4+4=8. Alternatively, if the components aren't specified, but the total is given, maybe the answer should be "NA"? But the example shows that even when the text says "summa 4+3=7", the JSON uses "4+3=7". Here, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the detailed part mentions Gleason 4. So perhaps the correct approach is to take the major as 4 and minor as 4. Therefore, "4+4=8".
