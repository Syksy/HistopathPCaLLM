Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here translate to biopsies, radical prostatectomies, and TURPs (höyläys is a colloquial term for TURP). However, the sample is described as "Opetusmateriaali useammalta potilaalta" which means teaching material from multiple patients. Since it's a collection of different samples, there's no single original sample type specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" (after a benign diagnosis) and "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". Wait, Gleason 3+3 is considered Grade Group 1, which is still cancer, albeit low-risk. But the original diagnosis was benign. However, the re-evaluation led to some cases being upgraded to Gleason 6 (which is 3+3). But the summary says "benignin materiaali nousi... Gleason 3+3:ksi". But if the original diagnosis was benign, but upon re-evaluation, some were classified as Gleason 6 (which is cancer), does that mean malignancy is present? However, the text also states "Uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan" meaning re-evaluation didn't lead to upgrading benign cases to GG3 or higher. Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me parse again.

The key points: The material was collected after a benign diagnosis. About 1/4 of cases, benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4. But re-evaluation (uudelleenarviointi) didn't lead to benign cases being upgraded to GG3 or higher. Wait, maybe there's a translation nuance. The original samples were benign, but during the study, some were classified as Gleason 3+3 (GG1) or 3+4 (GG2). However, the re-evaluation by the senior pathologist led to some cases being upgraded to Gleason 6 (which is 3+3=6, GG1). But the text says "johti jokuseen tapaukseen jossa nousu esim. Gleason 6:een". So some cases were upgraded to Gleason 6, which is cancer. Therefore, there are malignant findings in the samples. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

But wait, the original diagnosis was benign, but during the study, some were reclassified as having cancer. The question is whether the sample contains malignant findings. Since the study found cases where the benign material was reclassified as Gleason 6 (which is cancer), then the answer is "kyllä". However, the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (return the worst lesion's results). So even if some samples are benign and others are malignant, we take the worst, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". The highest mentioned is 3+4=7. However, the summary says "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. But the worst case in the samples would be 3+4=7. However, the text says "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" (at most 3+4). So the highest Gleason sum is 7. But the example given in the problem uses the specific instance from the text. Wait, the example in the problem statement had "4+3=7" because that's what was explicitly stated. Here, the text says "korkeintaan 3+4" (up to 3+4=7), but in the summary, it's "esim. Gleason 6:een" (for example, to Gleason 6). So the worst case is 3+4=7. But the user instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the text says "noin 1/4:stä tapauksista, benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". So the worst is 3+4=7. However, the next sentence says "Uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan". GG3 is Gleason 4+3=7 or higher. Wait, GG3 is 4+3=7, GG4 is 8, GG5 is 9-10. So the re-evaluation didn't lead to upgrading benign cases to GG3 or higher. But the initial reclassification (before senior re-evaluation?) had some up to 3+4=7 (GG2). Then, when re-evaluated by the senior, some cases were upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3=6, GG1). So the worst Gleason in the samples after senior review is 3+3=6? Or is the worst 3+4=7 from the initial classification?

The text is a bit confusing. Let me re-read the relevant parts:

Original statement: "noin 1/4:stä tapauksista, benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi kiitos kuvantamismetodien kehittymisen. Uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan."

Translation: About 1/4 of cases, benign material was upgraded in their classification to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4 thanks to imaging methods. Re-evaluation did not lead even once to upgrading benign to GG3 or higher.

So the initial upgrade was to 3+3 or 3+4 (GG1 or GG2). But when re-evaluated (by seniors?), they didn't go to GG3 (which is 4+3=7 or higher). So the worst after re-evaluation is 3+4=7 (GG2), but the re-evaluation didn't lead to GG3. Wait, but the initial upgrade was to 3+4=7 (GG2), and the re-evaluation didn't push any to GG3. So the worst Gleason is 3+4=7. But the summary says "johti jokuseen tapaukseen jossa nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" (led to some cases where there was an upgrade, for example to Gleason 6). So some cases were upgraded to 6 (3+3), others to 7 (3+4). The worst is 3+4=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

But the user instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. So even if some are 3+3 and some 3+4, the worst is 3+4=7. So the answer for Gleason is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The samples are a mix of biopsies, prostatectomies, and TURPs, but the text refers to them as teaching material from multiple patients. The original sample type isn't specified for a single case, so NA.

Malignancy: Yes, because some cases were upgraded to malignant (Gleason 6 or 7).

Gleason: 3+4=7.
