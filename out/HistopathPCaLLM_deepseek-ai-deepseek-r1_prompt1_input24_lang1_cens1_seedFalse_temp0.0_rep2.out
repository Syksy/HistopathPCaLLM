Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". So the samples include biopsies, radical prostatectomies (RP), and TURPs. But the context here is that these are teaching materials collected from multiple patients. However, the problem states to take the "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results), but the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions biopsy. Wait, but in this case, the samples are from various sources. However, the summary part says "Opetusmateriaali useammalta potilaalta tutkittiin" which means teaching materials from multiple patients. Since the sample type is about the original sample, but the text doesn't specify a single sample type. The example in the problem had a clear "biopsy" in the text. Here, the samples are a mix of biopsy, RP, and TURP. Since the task is to pick the original sample type, but the text is talking about multiple samples from different procedures. The instructions say to return the worst lesion's results, but sample type is about the original. However, if the text doesn't specify a single sample type, maybe the answer is NA. But the example had "biopsy" even though the text was a report. Wait, in the example, the sample was a biopsy. Here, the text is about a collection of samples from different procedures. So the original sample type isn't specified for a single case but refers to multiple. Therefore, the answer for sampletype should be NA.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" (after a benign diagnosis) and "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". Wait, Gleason 3+3 is still considered cancer (grade group 1), but 3+4 is also cancer. However, the text says "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan" which might mean that the material was initially benign but was upgraded. However, the key point is whether there are malignant findings. Since Gleason 3+3 and 3+4 are malignant, even if they were upgraded from benign, the presence of these scores indicates malignancy. The summary also mentions "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is 3+3=6. So the samples do have malignant findings. Therefore, malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". The worst case here is 3+4=7. However, the user instruction says to take the pahimman leesion tulokset (worst lesion results). The highest mentioned is 3+4=7. But the text also states "Uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan" which means re-evaluation didn't lead to upgrading benign to GG3 or higher. GG3 is Gleason 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. Wait, but the original cases were upgraded to 3+3 or 3+4. So the worst Gleason here is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since it's a mix of biopsy, RP, TURP and not a single sample), malignancy is kyllä, Gleason is 3+4=7.
