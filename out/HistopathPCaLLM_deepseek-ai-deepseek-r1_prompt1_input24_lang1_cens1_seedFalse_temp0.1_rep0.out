Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, it mentions "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". The Finnish terms here translate to biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TURPs (höyläys is a colloquial term for TURP). However, the sample in question is described as "Opetusmateriaali useammalta potilaalta tutkittiin", which means the teaching material comes from multiple patients with various sample types. Since the text refers to multiple types and doesn't specify a single sample type for the cases summarized, the correct answer here would be "NA" because the data isn't from a single sample type but a collection of different ones.

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states that "benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen" (after a benign diagnosis) and mentions that some benign materials were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4. However, it also notes that re-evaluation never led to upgrading benign cases to GG3 or higher. The key point here is whether there were any malignant findings. The cases discussed were initially benign, and even after re-evaluation, they didn't reach higher grades that would indicate malignancy. Gleason 6 (3+3) is considered low-grade but still technically malignant. However, the summary mentions "benigni materiaali nousi luokassaan joko Gleason 3+3:ksi tai korkeintaan 3+4:ksi". Wait, Gleason 3+3 is Grade Group 1, which is considered cancerous (malignant), but the text refers to this as "benigni materiaali". That's conflicting. However, in medical terms, Gleason 6 is still cancer, but maybe in this context, they're considering it as not malignant? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the text. But according to standard practice, Gleason 3+3 is adenocarcinoma, hence malignant. However, the text says "benigni materiaali nousi... Gleason 3+3:ksi", which might imply that the original diagnosis was benign, but upon re-evaluation, some were upgraded to Gleason 6. If the original samples were benign but later considered as Gleason 6, that would mean malignancy is present. But the question is whether the sample contains malignant findings. Since the summary mentions cases where benign material was upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3) or 3+4 (Gleason 7), which are malignant, but the user instruction says to report only the worst lesion's results. However, the text also states that "uudelleenarviointi ei johtanut kertaakaan benignin nostoon GG 3:een tai suurempaan", meaning re-evaluation didn't upgrade benign cases to GG3 (which would be Gleason 4+3=7 or higher). So the worst cases here are Gleason 3+4=7 (GG2) or 3+3=6 (GG1), both of which are malignant. Therefore, the answer for malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes), because there are malignant findings (Gleason 6 and 7). But wait, the initial diagnosis was benign, and upon re-evaluation, some were upgraded. So the samples do contain malignant cases. Hence, malignancy is present.

Third, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to report the worst lesion's Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format. The text mentions "nousi esim. Gleason 6:een" (e.g., rose to Gleason 6) and "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" (up to 3+4=7). The worst reported here is 3+4=7. However, the summary also says "johtui... ei ollut ohjata kliinistä päätöksentekoa", but the key is the highest Gleason. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But wait, the example given in the problem statement uses "4+3=7" as the sum. The order matters: the primary pattern (major) comes first. In the text, it's "3+4", so major is 3, minor 4? Wait, no. Wait, Gleason scoring is based on the most common pattern (primary) and the next most common (secondary). However, the higher grade is taken as the primary if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no. The Gleason score is the sum of the most prevalent grade and the highest grade present, but I might be mixing up the current versus old system. Actually, in the current grading system, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. But if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the highest remaining. Wait, no. For example, if a tumor has 60% grade 3, 30% grade 4, and 10% grade 5, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7, with the primary being 3 (most common) and secondary 4 (the highest grade among the remaining). So in the text, "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi" would be 3+4=7, which is the highest mentioned. However, the example in the user's instruction uses "4+3=7", which would be a different arrangement (primary 4, secondary 3). But according to the text, the highest is 3+4=7. So the correct Gleason here would be "3+4=7". However, the user's example uses "4+3=7", but that's just an example. The actual data depends on the text. The text says "korkeintaan 3+4:ksi", so the maximum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The samples are from multiple sources (biopsies, prostatectomies, TURPs) used as teaching material. Since it's a collection and not a single sample type, the answer is "NA".

Malignancy: There are cases upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3) and 7 (3+4), which are malignant. So "kyllä".

Gleason: The highest mentioned is 3+4=7, so "3+4=7".
