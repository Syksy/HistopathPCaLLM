Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" which translates to "sample" in Finnish. The examples given in the problem statement use "biopsy" when the sample is a biopsy. The report mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but in the current case, the samples are labeled as (1), (2), and (3). The term "biopsiasta" isn't explicitly mentioned here, but since these are samples taken for examination, it's likely they are biopsy samples. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which translates to "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is confirmed in the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the instructions specify to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The samples (1) and (2) have Gleason components. In sample (1), Gleason 4 is 20% and 3 is 30%. The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3, so 4+3=7. In sample (2), Gleason 4 is 15% and 3 is 35%. Here, even though the percentage of 3 is higher, the major component is still the higher grade (4), so it's 4+3=7 as well. Since we need the worst lesion, both samples have the same Gleason sum, so the highest is 4+3=7.

Sample (3) has no malignancy, so it's not considered. The PIN changes mentioned are not malignant, so they don't affect the Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7".
