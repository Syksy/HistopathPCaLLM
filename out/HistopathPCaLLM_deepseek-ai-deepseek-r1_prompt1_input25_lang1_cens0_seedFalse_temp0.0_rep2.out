Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "from prostate biopsy." So the original sample type is a biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Here, it's clearly a biopsy, so Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which means "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is diagnosed in the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the tricky part: Gleason score. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format. Let's look at the samples. 

Sample 1: Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%). So major 4, minor 3, sum 7. But wait, the percentages are 20% and 30%. However, the major pattern is the higher grade, not the higher percentage. Since Gleason 4 is higher than 3, the major is 4, minor 3, sum 7.

Sample 2: Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (35%). Again, major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. 

Sample 3: No malignancy. 

Between samples 1 and 2, both have Gleason 4+3=7. Since they are the same, the worst is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the user said to take the worst lesion's result. Both samples 1 and 2 have the same sum, so either would be the worst. So the answer is 4+3=7. 

Check if there's any higher grade mentioned. The text doesn't mention Gleason 5, so 4+3=7 is correct. 

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. Since both malignant samples have the same sum, it's straightforward. Also, the sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
