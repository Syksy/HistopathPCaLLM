Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are given, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, let's look at the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "Näyte (1)", "Näyte (2)", and "Näyte (3)". The Finnish word "näyte" translates to "sample". The original sample types could be biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). However, the text doesn't explicitly state which type these samples are. It just refers to them as samples 1, 2, and 3. Since there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy or surgery, I might have to default to "NA" here. But wait, the first sample is described as having Gleason patterns evaluated, which is typical in biopsies. However, the text doesn't confirm the type, so maybe "NA" is safer.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The conclusion states that prostate adenocarcinoma couldn't be reliably confirmed or ruled out. So there's no definite malignancy found, but it's not entirely ruled out either. The initial thought was PIN changes (which are benign), but that was later retracted. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here might be "ei" (no) or "NA". But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the conclusion says they can't confirm or deny, maybe "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. However, the presence of PIN changes (even if later retracted) might complicate things. But since they were retracted, maybe the malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" or "NA", the Gleason would be "NA". However, sample 1 had Gleason patterns evaluated. Wait, the text says "suurin piirtein kaikki pystyttiin arvioimaan Gleason erilaistumispatterniensa suhteen, mutta näkemyseroista johtuen tämä tapaus arvioidaan seuraavassa uro-miitissä." So they tried to evaluate Gleason patterns but due to differing opinions, it's to be assessed in a meeting. So there's a mention of Gleason, but no definitive sum given. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, even if there was a Gleason mentioned, the answer would still be "NA" because the malignancy is "ei" or "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so "NA". Malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei". Gleason is "NA" because malignancy is "ei". Wait, but the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). But in this case, the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed, so there's no malignancy. So the answer would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (since no malignancy is confirmed)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)
