Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" (specimen) with numbers (1), (2), (3). The text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but in the current case, the samples are just labeled as (1), (2), (3) without specifying the type. The text also mentions "PIN-muutoksia" (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is often found in biopsies. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the sample type. Since there's no clear mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The conclusion states that prostate adenocarcinoma couldn't be reliably confirmed or ruled out. The initial thought was PIN changes, which are considered pre-malignant, but those were later dismissed as unreliable. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, but also no clear benign diagnosis, the answer might be "ei" (no) because malignancy isn't confirmed. However, the example shows that if adenocarcinoma is mentioned, even if uncertain, it might still be "kyllä". Wait, in this case, the conclusion is that it can't be confirmed or denied. So maybe the malignancy status is unclear. But the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, and the previous suspicion was retracted, perhaps "ei" is appropriate. But the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's uncertain, maybe "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy. Alternatively, if the presence of malignancy is uncertain, maybe NA. But the options don't include uncertainty, just "kyllä", "ei", or NA. The report says "adenokarsinooma -löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota" (adenocarcinoma finding can't be reliably confirmed or denied). So there's no confirmed malignancy, but also not definitively ruled out. However, the options are strict. Since the answer must be one of the three, and the report doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps "ei" is correct. But maybe NA is better here because the status is uncertain. The example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" or NA. The user's instructions say for Gleason to be NA if benign. But in this case, the malignancy isn't confirmed. Hmm. The question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the answer is that it's uncertain, but the options are only yes, no, or NA. Since the report says they can't confirm or deny, maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no definitive malignant finding. Alternatively, NA. The example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's not found definitively, perhaps "ei". But I need to check the exact wording. The conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or denied. So the presence of malignancy is uncertain. But the options don't have 'uncertain', so maybe NA is the correct choice here. Because the answer isn't clearly yes or no. The user's instructions for Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, then NA would be appropriate. So in this case, since they can't confirm or deny, the malignancy status is NA.

Third, Gleason score. The report mentions that in sample (1), they could assess Gleason differentiation patterns, but due to differing opinions, it's to be evaluated in a uro meeting. However, no actual Gleason score is provided. The example had a specific Gleason sum. Here, since the assessment is pending and no score is given, and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. Even though they tried to assess it, the final result isn't stated, so it's not available. So Gleason is NA.

Sampletype: The samples are numbered, but the type isn't specified. The example used "biopsy" when it was mentioned. Here, the text doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype is NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't mentioned)
Malignancy: NA (because it's inconclusive)
Gleason: NA (no score provided)
