Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the user's query and the provided medical statement to extract the required information. The user wants structured data in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a specimen from a prostatectomy. Since prostatectomy is typically RP, the Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, Malignancy. The statement says there's a "widely spread tumor," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the value here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text states that the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent. So the major pattern is 4, minor is 3, summing to 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The largest tumor focus is on the basis side with Gleason 4 and 3, which is the highest grade mentioned. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere. Also, check that the JSON is valid without nested structures. All values are correctly mapped, so the final JSON should be as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
