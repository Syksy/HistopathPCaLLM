Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields.

Starting with the sample type. The user provided allowed values: biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so the sample type should be RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The text says there's a "widely spread tumor" and mentions "positive margins." So the malignancy is definitely "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text states the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Wait, but the order might matter. Typically, the higher grade is listed first. Since class 4 is almost as prevalent as the dominant 3, but dominant is 3. Wait, no. Wait, the dominant (major) is 3, and class 4 is almost as prevalent. Wait, but in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most common pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. So if the dominant is 3, then primary is 3, and secondary is 4. So the sum would be 3+4=7. But the way it's phrased here: "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." Hmm. So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement had 4+3=7. So the order depends on which is more prevalent. The dominant here is 3, so primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7. Wait, maybe I need to check. In the example given, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3" which results in 4+3=7. So the first number is the primary (most prevalent), the second is the secondary. So in the current case, the dominant is 3, and class 4 is almost as prevalent. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But I need to make sure. The text says "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: sampletype is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7.
