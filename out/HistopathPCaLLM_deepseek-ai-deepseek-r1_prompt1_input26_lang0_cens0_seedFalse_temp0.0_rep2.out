Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

Starting with the first field: Sample type. The user provided allowed values as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate". I know that "prostatectomy" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states there's a "widely spread tumor" and mentions "positive margins". The presence of a tumor, especially a malignant one, would mean the answer here is "yes". The example given in the instructions also uses "yes" when adenocarcinoma is detected, which is a malignant tumor. So "yes" seems correct here.

Now, the Gleason grade. The text says the largest tumor focus has the dominant Gleason as class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent. The Gleason score is typically the sum of the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) grades. Here, dominant is 3, and 4 is almost as prevalent. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. The sum would be 3+4=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The largest tumor focus is on the basis side, which is the most severe mentioned here. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere. Also, no invasive growth through the capsule, but that doesn't affect the Gleason score.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example. The example uses "biopsy" and the format "4+3=7". The user specified to use the most severe lesion, which in this case is the largest tumor focus with Gleason 3+4. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
