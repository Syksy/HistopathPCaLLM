Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, which was translated to "biopsy". In the current case, the text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, which is usually a radical prostatectomy. The abbreviation for radical prostatectomy is RP. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "laaja kasvain", which translates to a widespread tumor. Also, there's "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive margins) and "kasvainfokus" (tumor focus). All these indicate malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". Vallitseva means predominant, so the major pattern is 3. Then, class 4 is almost as much, which would be the minor component. However, Gleason scoring takes the two most common patterns, with the major first. If they are almost equal, sometimes the higher grade might be considered the major. Wait, but the wording here says "vallitseva" (predominant) is 3, and class 4 is almost as much. So major is 3, minor is 4. So sum is 3+4=7. But the user example had 4+3=7. Wait, the example had major 4 and minor 3. So in this case, the major is 3, minor is 4. So the sum would be 3+4=7. But I need to check if the text says that the amount of 4 is almost as much as 3. In such cases, sometimes the higher grade is listed first. But according to the current Gleason grading system, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, regardless of the grade. However, if the higher grade is present in a significant amount (even if less than the primary), sometimes it's considered. Wait, but the user's instruction says to take the pahimman (worst) lesion's results. So maybe in this case, since there's a significant amount of grade 4, even if grade 3 is predominant, but the sum is 3+4=7. But the text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example had 4+3=7. The order matters. The user's example had major 4 and minor 3. So in this case, the major is 3, minor is 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7". The system should report the major and minor as per the text. The text clearly states that the predominant (vallitseva) is 3, and class 4 is almost as much. So the major is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the sum is 7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is "RP" because it's a prostatektomiapreparaatti (radical prostatectomy).

Malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a tumor with positive margins.

Gleason is "3+4=7" as per the description.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions "suurin kasvainfokus" (largest tumor focus) with the Gleason 3 and 4. So that's the one to report.
