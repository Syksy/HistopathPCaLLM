Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". The Finnish term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure. The options for sample type are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since "prostatektomia" is likely a radical prostatectomy, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text mentions "laaja kasvain" which means a widespread tumor, and "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" indicating positive margins. There's also a reference to Gleason grading. So, malignancy is present. The answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the key part is "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". The primary pattern is 3, and secondary is 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses "biopsy" as sample type when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". Here, "prostatektomiapreparaatti" clearly points to RP. All other parts seem to fit the required structure. No mention of TURP or biopsy, so RP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is correctly formatted. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to ensure accuracy. Yep, looks good. So the JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
