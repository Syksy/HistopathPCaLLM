Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text says "Tutkittu materiaali on prostatasta..." which translates to "The material examined is from the prostate..." but it doesn't explicitly mention the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The examples given in the problem use "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of the procedure type, just that it's from the prostate. So I might have to put "NA" for Sampletype since it's not specified.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed for treatment trajectory. However, there's a mention of possible 'Gleason summa 7' in the clinic notes. Even though it's unclear if it's GG2 or 3, the presence of a Gleason score suggests malignancy. But wait, the report states that the material from apex and basis is very difficult to evaluate because of recent RT. The key here is whether malignant findings were present. The text doesn't explicitly state adenocarcinoma or malignancy, only that Gleason sum 7 is mentioned in clinic notes but not confirmed here. Since the histopathology can't be reliably done, maybe the malignancy status is uncertain. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample couldn't be assessed due to RT effects, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, the instructions say "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the sample couldn't be evaluated reliably, then maybe the answer is "NA". But the presence of a Gleason sum mentioned in clinic notes complicates things. However, the report says that due to RT, the histopathology can't be reliably done. So the sample itself might not show clear malignancy. So maybe "ei" or "NA". The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is found. Here, since the sample is hard to evaluate and the Gleason is from clinic notes (not confirmed here), perhaps malignancy is "NA" or "kyllä". Hmm. The problem says to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the sample couldn't be assessed, but there's a possible Gleason sum 7 mentioned, but it's unclear. The malignancy field is "kyllä" only if malignant findings are present in the sample. Since the sample's evaluation is unreliable, maybe the answer is "NA". But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). If the sample couldn't be assessed, perhaps the answer is "NA" for malignancy. Alternatively, if the Gleason is mentioned, even if uncertain, maybe "kyllä". But the example shows that when adenocarcinoma is present, it's "kyllä". Here, the report doesn't confirm malignancy in the sample, just mentions a possible Gleason from clinic notes. So maybe "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason sum 7, which implies malignancy. But the report says it's unclear if it's confirmed. This is a bit ambiguous. The user might expect "kyllä" because Gleason is mentioned, but the sample itself is hard to assess. Hmm. Let me check the original text again: "Kliinikan merkinnöissä mainitaan mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'; toisaalta, on epäselvää onko tämä GG 2 vai 3 ja vahvistettiinko 7 summa-arvo." So the Gleason sum 7 is mentioned in clinic notes, but not confirmed in this sample. Since the sample's histopathology is unreliable due to RT, the malignancy in the sample itself is uncertain. Therefore, the answer for malignancy might be "NA" because the sample couldn't be assessed, even though there's a possible Gleason from clinic notes. But the problem states to report the worst lesion's results from the sample. If the sample can't be assessed, then maybe "ei" or "NA". The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample's evaluation is unreliable, and no definite malignancy is found in the sample, perhaps "NA" is appropriate here. Alternatively, if the possible Gleason is considered, maybe "kyllä". But the example uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is found. Here, the sample's own findings are unclear. So I think "NA" is safer for malignancy.

Third, Gleason. The text mentions 'mahdollinen Gleason summa 7' but it's unclear if confirmed. Since the sample can't be reliably assessed, and the Gleason is from clinic notes, not the current sample's result, the Gleason here would be "NA". But the problem says to report the Gleason for malignant findings. If malignancy is "NA", then Gleason is "NA". However, if malignancy is considered "kyllä" because of the possible Gleason, then Gleason would be "NA" because the exact major and minor grades aren't given. The text says "Gleason summa 7" but doesn't specify 3+4 or 4+3. The required format is "major+minor=sum". Since the sum is 7 but the components are unknown, we can't structure it as "X+Y=7". Therefore, even if malignancy is "kyllä", the Gleason would be "NA" because the individual components aren't provided. So the answer for Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: Not specified in the text, so "NA".

Malignancy: Since the sample's evaluation is unreliable and the Gleason mentioned is from clinic notes (not confirmed here), "NA".

Gleason: No specific major+minor given, so "NA".
