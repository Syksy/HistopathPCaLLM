Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "prostate biopsy." So the sample type here is biopsy. That's straightforward. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text doesn't explicitly state malignancy, but there's a mention of possible 'Gleason summa 7'. Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer grading, which implies malignancy. However, the report also says that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed. But the presence of a Gleason sum suggests that malignancy was at least considered. However, the text is unclear whether the Gleason sum was confirmed. But since the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample, and the Gleason is mentioned (even if uncertain), I think the answer here is "kyllä". Because the possibility is there, even if it's uncertain. But wait, the report says the material is very difficult to evaluate because of recent radiation therapy, and the Gleason sum is mentioned in clinical notes but it's unclear. So maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. Hmm. The key is whether the sample itself showed malignancy. The text says "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'" which means possible. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the histopathology can't be reliably done due to RT, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed. But the presence of a Gleason sum in the notes might indicate that malignancy is present, but the exact grading is uncertain. So perhaps Malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason, which is for cancer. But the report also states that the histopathology can't be reliably assessed. This is a bit conflicting. However, the instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. If there's a possible Gleason sum, even if uncertain, maybe we should mark malignancy as yes. Alternatively, if the sample couldn't be assessed reliably, maybe it's NA. But the options are only kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report mentions Gleason sum, which is for cancer, I think malignancy is "kyllä" even if uncertain. So Malignancy: "kyllä".

Third, Gleason. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. The text says "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'; toisaalta, on epäselvää onko tämä GG 2 vai 3 ja vahvistettiinko 7 summa-arvo." So the sum is possibly 7, but it's unclear if it's GG2 or 3 (which correspond to different major/minor patterns). Since the exact components (4+3 vs 3+4) aren't specified, and the sum is 7 but not confirmed, how do we report this? The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when both components are known. Here, the components are unclear. The user instructions say to report the Gleason grade as "major+minor=sum" if available. If the components aren't specified, maybe we can't form that string. But the sum is mentioned as 7, even if unconfirmed. However, the problem states that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. But since the components are unknown, perhaps we can't report the sum in the required format. The allowed value is "major+minor=sum" as integers or NA. If the components aren't given, even if the sum is mentioned, maybe we have to put NA. But the example shows that when the sum is given with components, it's structured. Here, the sum is 7 but components are unclear. The problem says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". The report mentions 'Gleason summa 7', so that's the reported sum. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". Since the major and minor aren't specified, perhaps we can't construct that. So in this case, even though the sum is 7, since the individual grades aren't clear, the Gleason field would be NA. Wait, but the example in the problem had "4+3=7" when both were known. Here, the sum is 7 but the components are unknown. The user instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. Since malignancy is "kyllä", but the components aren't specified, maybe we can't fill the Gleason field. But the report does mention summa 7. However, the required format is strict. If the components (major and minor) aren't given, even if the sum is known, we can't format it as "X+Y=Z". Therefore, the Gleason field would be NA. But wait, the problem says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". The report says "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'". So the sum is reported as 7, but the individual grades are unclear. The user might expect "3+4=7" or "4+3=7", but since it's unclear which, maybe we can't specify. Therefore, the correct answer here is "NA" for Gleason. But the example in the problem shows that when the components are known, it's structured. Here, the components are unknown, so even though the sum is 7, it's not in the required format. So Gleason: "NA".

Wait, but the problem says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if the malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason should be in the sum format. But if the sum is reported but the components are not, then perhaps the answer is "NA" even if malignancy is present. Because the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the components are not specified, even if the sum is known, it can't be formatted properly. Therefore, in this case, since the components are unclear, the Gleason is "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's a biopsy sample)
Malignancy: kyllä (because Gleason sum is mentioned, implying malignancy)
Gleason: NA (because the individual grades aren't specified, even though the sum is 7)
