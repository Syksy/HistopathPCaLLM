Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The key points are to determine the sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade, focusing on the most severe lesion.

First, the sample type. The original statement mentions "shavings" and "blocks F & G." Shavings typically come from a TURP procedure, which is a transurethral resection of the prostate. So the sample type should be TURP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. TURP fits here.

Next, malignancy. The report clearly states "Carcinoma was histologically detected." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 3+3=6." The user wants the format "major+minor=sum." So that's straightforward: "3+3=6." Since this is the only Gleason mentioned and it's from the blocks where carcinoma was found, it's the most severe lesion here.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all fields are present and correctly spelled. Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason with the right capitalization.

No other lesions are mentioned, so this is the most severe one. Everything seems to fit. Let me put it all together in JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
