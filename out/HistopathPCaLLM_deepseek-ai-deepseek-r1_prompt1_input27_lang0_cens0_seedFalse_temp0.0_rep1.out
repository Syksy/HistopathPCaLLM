Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input mentions "shavings" and "blocks F & G." Shavings in this context are typically from a TURP procedure, where tissue is shaved off the prostate. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, malignancy. The report states "Carcinoma was histologically detected," which clearly indicates a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text here says "Gleason 3+3=6." That's straightforward. The correct format is "3+3=6." Even though it's the same pattern for both, the sum is 6. So Gleason should be "3+3=6."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example shows a flat structure, so just key-value pairs. Also, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Here, there's only one mentioned (3+3=6), so that's the one to use. No other lesions are noted.

Double-checking the sample type. TURP is correct because shavings are involved. Biopsy would be needle cores, RP is the whole prostate removed. So yes, TURP fits here.

Malignancy is definitely yes because carcinoma is present. Gleason is explicitly stated. All fields are covered. No need for NA in any of them here. The JSON should be valid, so quotes around the keys and values, proper commas. Let me put it all together.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
