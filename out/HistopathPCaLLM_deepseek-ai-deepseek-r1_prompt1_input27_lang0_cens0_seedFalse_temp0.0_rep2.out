Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement mentions "shavings" and "blocks F & G." Shavings in this context are typically from a TURP procedure, where tissue is shaved off the prostate. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, malignancy. The report states "Carcinoma was histologically detected." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum." The text says "Gleason 3+3=6." So the correct entry is "3+3=6."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward here. Also, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's only one mentioned (blocks F & G with 3+3=6). So that's the one to report.

Double-checking everything: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+3=6. All allowed values are used correctly. The JSON should be valid with those entries.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
