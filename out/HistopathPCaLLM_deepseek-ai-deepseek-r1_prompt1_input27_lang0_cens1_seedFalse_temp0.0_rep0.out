Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." Hmm, the text mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the procedure. The samples are indexed F and G, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I think the answer here is NA because the sample type isn't clearly stated.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The statement says "growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation." The phrase "did not follow normal differentiation" might suggest malignancy, but it's a bit ambiguous. However, the next part mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." Gleason score 3 is part of the grading system, but typically, Gleason 3 is considered a lower grade. However, the presence of any Gleason score usually indicates malignancy. But wait, the text says "debatably" and "maybe," which introduces uncertainty. The key here is whether the report confirms malignancy. Since it's not definitive and uses uncertain language like "debatably" and "maybe," maybe the malignancy answer should be "no" or "NA"? But the user instructions say to return the most severe lesion. If there's a possible Gleason 3, even in small quantities, does that count as malignant? I think in clinical terms, any presence of cancer (even if small) would be "yes" for malignancy. But the uncertainty here complicates things. The statement doesn't explicitly state adenocarcinoma or malignancy, just mentions abnormal growth patterns and a possible Gleason 3. Maybe the answer here is "yes" because Gleason is mentioned, even if it's uncertain. Or perhaps "no" because it's not confirmed. Hmm. I need to be careful. The user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if there's a Gleason score mentioned, even tentatively, does that imply malignancy? I think yes, because Gleason grading is for prostate cancer. So maybe Malignancy is "yes".

Third, the Gleason grade. The text says "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." The allowed format is "major+minor=sum". If the Gleason score is 3, that would typically be 3+3=6. But the text says "score 3" which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, Gleason score is the sum of the two most prevalent grades. So a score of 3 would mean the sum is 3, but that's not possible because the lowest is 1+1=2. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Or perhaps in the text, "Gleason score 3" refers to the pattern 3, not the sum. So if the major and minor are both 3, then it's 3+3=6. But the text says "score 3" which is confusing. Wait, the Gleason score is the sum of the primary and secondary grades. So a score of 3 would require grades 1+2 or 2+1, but those are very low. However, in practice, Gleason scores start at 6 (3+3) now due to changes in grading. Maybe the text is using old terminology. Alternatively, maybe the mention of "Gleason score 3" is a mistake, and they meant pattern 3. If that's the case, then the Gleason would be 3+3=6, but the text doesn't mention another grade. Since the text only mentions score 3, but that's not a valid sum, perhaps the answer is NA. However, the user example shows that even if the sum is 7, they write "4+3=7". So in this case, if the score is 3, but that's not possible, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, if the text intended to say pattern 3, but the sum isn't clear, maybe the answer is NA. The text also says "in small quantities" and "debatably", so maybe it's not a confirmed Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is "yes" because there's a possible Gleason mentioned, indicating cancer. Gleason is NA because the score mentioned (3) is invalid, or the information is uncertain. Wait, but if the Gleason is 3, maybe it's a typo and they meant 3+3=6. But the text says "score 3", which is the sum. Since that's not possible, perhaps the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the user expects to take the mentioned score as is, even if it's incorrect. But according to the allowed values, the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. Since the text only mentions "score 3", which is invalid, the answer should be NA. So final structured data would be:

Sampletype: NA

Malignancy: yes (because possible cancer is indicated by the mention of Gleason, even if uncertain)

Gleason: NA (because the score provided is invalid or incomplete)
