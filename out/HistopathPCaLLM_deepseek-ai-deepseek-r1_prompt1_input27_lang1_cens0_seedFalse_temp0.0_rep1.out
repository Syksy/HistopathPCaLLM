Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Yhteensä 13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which is typical for a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti blokeissa F & G..." which means carcinoma was found. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". Even though it's written as 3+3=6, the correct format is to present it as "3+3=6". The user specified to include the sum as part of the string. Since there's a malignancy, we don't use "NA" here.

I need to ensure that the JSON keys are correctly spelled and the values match the allowed options. No nested structures, just flat keys. Let me double-check each part:

- Sampletype: TURP (from TURP procedure terms)
- Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
- Gleason: 3+3=6 (exactly as reported)

Everything seems to fit. No issues detected.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
