Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Yhteensä 13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings," which is typical in a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti..." which means carcinoma was found. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example shows "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". Even though it's 3+3=6, the correct format is to present it as "3+3=6". However, the user specified that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. Here, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's the one to use.

Wait, the example in the problem uses "4+3=7" as the format, so I should follow that exactly. The input here is 3+3=6, so the Gleason field should be "3+3=6".

No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is TURP because of the mention of höyläyslastuja (TURP chips). Malignancy is confirmed with "karsinoomaa". Gleason is explicitly given as 3+3=6. All seems correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
