Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The input mentions "kuusi biopsialieriötä", which translates to six biopsy cylinders. So the sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) and "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue), which are malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason. The instruction says to take the worst lesion. There are three pesäkkeet (lesions). Pesäke 1 has Gleason 4+4=8. Pesäke 2 is 4+3=7. Pesäke 3 is 3+4=7. The highest is 8 from pesäke 1. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. No nested structures, just the three fields. Also, check that for malignancy, if there's any malignant finding, it's "kyllä". Since all lesions here are malignant, that's confirmed. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy yes, and Gleason the highest sum. That's it.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
