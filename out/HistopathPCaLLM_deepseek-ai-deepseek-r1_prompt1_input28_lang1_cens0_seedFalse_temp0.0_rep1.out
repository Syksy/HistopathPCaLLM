Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is in Finnish, so I need to parse that carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä", which translates to six biopsy cylinders. So the sample type is definitely biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, there are references to "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue) and "maligni löydös" (malignant finding). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the worst lesion. The summary at the end states "Yhteenvetona korkeimman graden maligni löydös pesäkkeessä 1 pistesummalla 8." So the highest Gleason score is 8, which in the report is detailed as 4+4=8 in lesion 1. Even though other lesions have lower scores (like 4+3=7 and 3+4=7), the highest is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. No nested structures, just the three fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm malignancy and sample type. Yes, "biopsi" is biopsy, and adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. The highest Gleason is correctly identified from the summary. All set.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
