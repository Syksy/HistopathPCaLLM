Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the query again to make sure I understand the requirements.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä", which translates to six biopsy cylinders. So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, whether there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, other terms like "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue) confirm malignancy. So "kyllä" is the answer here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The example given was "4+3=7". The user emphasized taking only the highest grade. The report's summary states: "Yhteenvetona korkeimman graden maligni löydös pesäkkeessä 1 pistesummalla 8." So the highest is in lesion 1 with Gleason 4+4=8. Even though other lesions have lower scores (like 4+3=7 and 3+4=7), we only take the worst one. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Let me double-check each part. Sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. The JSON structure should have these as keys. No nested structures, just flat. The example provided uses "Gleason" as the key with the sum string. All looks good. I think that's all.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
