Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line says "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." The mention of the prostate being obtained as a fresh specimen with a weight around 40g makes me think this is a radical prostatectomy (RP), since biopsies or TURP specimens are usually smaller. TURP is typically for removing tissue from the prostate in cases of BPH, and the weight here is higher, so RP is more likely. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" which is a malignant tumor. There's also mention of penetration of the capsule and perineural invasion, both indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." However, the detailed description says "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If both major and minor components are grade 4, then the sum would be 4+4=8. But the summary mentions sum 7. There's a discrepancy here. The user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The detailed part might have a typo, maybe "smaller portion as grade 3"? But the text actually says "smaller portion as grade 4". However, the summary says sum 7, which is 4+3=7. So perhaps the main components are 4 and 3. But the detailed part says both are grade 4. This is conflicting. But since the summary is a summary, maybe that's the accurate part. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7" as per the summary. Even though the detailed part seems contradictory, the summary takes precedence. So the answer is "4+3=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+3=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
