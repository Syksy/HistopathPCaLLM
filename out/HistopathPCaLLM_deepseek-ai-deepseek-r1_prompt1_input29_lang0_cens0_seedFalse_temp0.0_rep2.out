Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." The term "fresh sample specimen" and the mention of weight around 40g makes me think this is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP), since biopsies or TURP specimens are usually smaller. Biopsy samples are typically multiple small cores, and TURP specimens are chips from the prostate's inner part. A whole prostate with that weight would be RP. So Sampletype is probably RP.

Next, Malignancy. The text states "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. There's also mention of penetration into the capsule and perineural invasion, both signs of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the summary says "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." The main thing is to format it as major+minor=sum. The report mentions "mostly grade 4 differentiation... smaller portion as grade 4." Wait, that's both major and minor as 4? But the summary says sum 7, which would be 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check again. The tumor cells have "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4." That would be 4+4=8, but the summary says sum 7. That's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo. Wait, the original text says "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." Wait, that can't be right. If both major and minor are 4, sum is 8. But the summary says sum 7. So perhaps there's an error in the text. Alternatively, maybe the smaller portion is grade 3. Let me re-read the text. The exact quote: "Tumor cells form both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." So both are grade 4. But the summary says sum 7. That's conflicting. However, the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The summary mentions "Score sum 7," which would be 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. But according to the description, both major and minor are 4. Maybe the summary is correct, and the description has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the "smaller portion" is grade 3. Maybe the user intended that. Since the summary says sum 7, I should go with that. So Gleason would be "4+3=7" or "3+4=7". The text says "mostly grade 4" which would be the major component, so 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7.
