Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata," which translates to "Fresh sample received from the prostate." The mention of different sections (A, B, C, etc.) taken from various parts (apex, left and right lobes) suggests it's a biopsy procedure. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa" (invasive adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3" (most of grade 4 differentiation, and a smaller amount of grade 3). The summary also says "Pistesumman 7," which refers to a total score of 7. The correct format is "major+minor=sum," so here it's 4+3=7. 

I need to ensure there are no nested structures in the JSON and only include the worst lesion's results. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All other details like tumor size or perineural invasion are noted but not required for the structured data. 

Double-checking the allowed values: Sampletype is valid, malignancy is correctly "kyllä," and Gleason follows the required format. Everything seems to fit.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
