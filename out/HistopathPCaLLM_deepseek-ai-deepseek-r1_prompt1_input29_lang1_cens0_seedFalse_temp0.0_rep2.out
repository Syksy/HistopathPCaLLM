Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata," which translates to "Fresh sample received from the prostate." The mention of different sections (A, B, C, etc.) taken from various parts (apex, left and right lobes) suggests it's a biopsy procedure. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa" (invasive adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3" (most of grade 4 differentiation, and minor grade 3). The summary also says "Pistesumman 7," which is a total score of 7. The correct format is "major+minor=sum," so "4+3=7."

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The report mentions findings in the left lobe (A and C) with the highest Gleason score, so that's the one to use. All other details like tumor size or invasion are not required for these fields. 

Double-checking the sample type: "Tuorenäytteenä" refers to a fresh sample, which in this context is a biopsy. RP and TURP are specific procedures, but the description here doesn't mention surgery or resection, just sampling from different lobes. So biopsy is correct.

Malignancy is clearly present due to adenocarcinoma. Gleason is correctly formatted as 4+3=7. No other grades are mentioned for the worst lesion, so that's the one to report.
