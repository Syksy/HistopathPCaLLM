Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material was obtained. The samples were taken from different areas (A-F), which sounds like a biopsy procedure. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's about taking multiple samples from different regions, this is likely a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text says that in samples A and C, they found tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignancy in the samples. The summary also states that determining the Gleason score wasn't possible. Since there's no mention of malignant findings, and the problematic samples are to be re-examined, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no). But wait, maybe I need to check again. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If there's no mention of malignancy in any sample, then malignancy is "ei". However, the samples of interest (A and C) had contamination, but other samples (B, D, E, F) aren't mentioned as having malignancy either. So the answer here is "ei".

For Gleason, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason should be "NA". The summary explicitly says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" (Determining the score wasn't possible), which aligns with "NA" when there's no malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the example given. In their example, when malignancy is present, Gleason is filled. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That makes sense. Also, the sample type is biopsy because they took multiple cores from different regions, typical for a biopsy procedure. The contamination in A and C doesn't affect the sample type determination. So the final JSON should be as follows.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
