Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material was obtained. The examples given for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, the samples are labeled A-F with locations, which is typical for biopsy cores. Also, the example with "biopsiasta" in the sample was classified as biopsy. Here, since they mention multiple samples from different parts (A-F), it's likely a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text says that in samples A and C, they found tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. The main samples of interest (A and C) couldn't be assessed for things like perineural invasion or tumor differentiation. The summary states that determining the Gleason score wasn't possible and that A and C need re-examination. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy in the samples that were properly taken (maybe B, D, E, F?), but the problematic ones (A and C) had contamination. However, the report doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in any of the other samples. Since the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if malignancy isn't mentioned, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, but the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here. The report doesn't say any samples had cancer, only that A and C were contaminated. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported. But wait, the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the other samples (B, D, E, F) were okay but not mentioned, but the main focus was on A and C which were contaminated, then maybe malignancy isn't determined. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the report doesn't mention any cancer in the other samples, and the problematic ones couldn't be assessed, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". The example given in the problem had "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, since no malignancy is reported, perhaps "ei" is correct. But I need to be careful. The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any, then "ei". But maybe the answer is "NA" if it's uncertain. However, the samples that were available (other than A and C) might not have shown malignancy. The text doesn't say anything about malignancy in the other samples. So the answer here is "ei" because no malignancy was found in the samples that were properly taken, but the ones that were problematic (A and C) couldn't be assessed. Wait, but the user instruction says to report the worst lesion. If the worst lesion is not found because the samples were contaminated, then maybe the answer is "NA". Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the original text again. The summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista, näytteet A ja C tutkitaan uudelleen." So the Gleason score couldn't be determined because the samples of interest (A and C) were contaminated. But does that mean there was no malignancy found in the other samples? The text doesn't mention any malignancy in B, D, E, F. So if those samples were okay but not showing cancer, then malignancy is "ei". But if the presence of malignancy is uncertain because the main samples couldn't be assessed, then maybe "NA". The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state any, then "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason. Since malignancy is "ei", then according to the instructions, Gleason should be "NA". Also, the summary says determining the score wasn't possible. So "NA" is correct here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
