Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material was obtained. The examples given for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, the samples are labeled A-F with locations, which is typical for biopsy cores. Also, the example with "biopsiasta" in the sample was classified as biopsy. Here, since they mention multiple samples from different parts (A-F), it's likely a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text says that in samples A and C, they found tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. The main samples of interest (A and C) couldn't be assessed for things like perineural invasion or tumor differentiation. The summary states that determining the Gleason score wasn't possible and that A and C need re-examination. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy in the samples that were properly taken (maybe B, D, E, F?), but the problematic ones (A and C) had contamination. However, the report doesn't explicitly state whether malignancy was found in any of the other samples. Since the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if malignancy isn't mentioned, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, but the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed here. The report doesn't say any samples had cancer, only that A and C were contaminated. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported. But wait, the user instruction says "pahimman leesion" (worst lesion) results. If there's no mention of malignancy in any sample, then malignancy is "ei". But if the report is inconclusive because some samples couldn't be assessed, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. Here, since the samples of interest (A and C) were contaminated and others aren't mentioned, maybe the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was detected in the other samples. Alternatively, if the report doesn't mention malignancy at all, maybe it's "NA". But the user's allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't state any malignancy found, and the problematic samples couldn't be assessed, but the others (B, D, E, F) aren't mentioned as having cancer, perhaps the malignancy is "ei". But I need to be careful. The user instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any, then "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason. The summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" which means determining the score wasn't possible. Since malignancy is "ei", according to the instructions, Gleason should be "NA". But wait, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But in this case, maybe the malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found, so Gleason is "NA". Alternatively, if the malignancy couldn't be determined, but the user instruction says to answer "NA" for Gleason if benign. So if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". That makes sense. So in this case, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
