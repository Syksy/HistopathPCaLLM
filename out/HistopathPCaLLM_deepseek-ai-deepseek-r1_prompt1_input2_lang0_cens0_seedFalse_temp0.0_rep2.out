Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as an autopsy sample intended for research. The beginning also says it's a fresh prostatectomy specimen. Wait, but the original sample is autopsy. However, the options don't include autopsy. The instructions say to use the allowed values, so since autopsy isn't one of them, maybe NA? But the example given uses biopsy when the statement mentions biopsy. Hmm. The original sample here is an autopsy sample, which isn't in the allowed list. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that all macrosections present normal benign growth. The summary says prostate tissue contains at most low inflammation and changes due to aging. No mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor. The resection surfaces are clean, capsule is normal, and seminal vesicles have no tumor. So Malignancy should be "no".

Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some growth, like hyperplasia, that's benign. So no Gleason reported here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because autopsy isn't an allowed value. Malignancy is no. Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in JSON. The example uses quotes around the values, so follow that. Check if the original sample type is mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The report says "original sample is an autopsy sample" so none of the allowed types. Hence NA. Correct.
