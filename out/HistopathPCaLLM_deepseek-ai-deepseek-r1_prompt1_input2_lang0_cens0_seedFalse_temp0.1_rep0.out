Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as an autopsy sample intended for research. The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen, but the original sample is autopsy. However, autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. The allowed values don't include autopsy, so maybe I should check if there's another clue. Wait, the original sample is an autopsy sample, but the current sample is a prostatectomy. But the question asks for the original sample type. Since autopsy isn't an allowed value, maybe it's NA. But the example given uses "biopsy" when the sample is a biopsy. Here, the original sample is autopsy, which isn't in the allowed list. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "normal benign growth," "no abnormal growth," and "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." The summary states "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignancy or cancer. So Malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original sample is autopsy (not allowed), Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA.
