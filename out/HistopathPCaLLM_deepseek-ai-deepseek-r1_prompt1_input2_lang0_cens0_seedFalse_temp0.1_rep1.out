Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as an autopsy sample intended for research use. The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen. Wait, but the original sample is an autopsy. However, the options don't include autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, the answer here should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states that the microscopy shows normal benign growth, some atrophy and inflammation, hyperplasia, and no tumor growth in seminal vesicles. The summary mentions prostate tissue with low inflammatory state and changes due to normal aging. There's no mention of malignancy or adenocarcinoma. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original sample is an autopsy, which isn't listed. Malignancy is no. Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, the most severe is benign, so all fields should reflect that.
