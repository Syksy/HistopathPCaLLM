Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as an autopsy sample intended for research. The first part also mentions it's a fresh prostatectomy specimen. Wait, but the original sample is autopsy. However, the options don't include autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, I should put NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states that the prostate tissue has benign growth, some atrophy, inflammation, hyperplasia, and no tumor growth in seminal vesicles. The summary mentions no malignancy, just inflammatory state and aging changes. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since autopsy isn't an allowed value), Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Let me check the example again. The example uses quotes around the values and the keys. The JSON should be valid. Alright, that should be it.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
