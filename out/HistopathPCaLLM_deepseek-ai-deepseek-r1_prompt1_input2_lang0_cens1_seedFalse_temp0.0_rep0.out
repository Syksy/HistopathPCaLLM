Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an autopsy specimen. Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says there's a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's noted that further inspection is needed and findings can't be reliably inferred. Since it's uncertain, the Malignancy field should be NA instead of yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text here doesn't specify any Gleason grades, just mentions possible adenocarcinoma but no details. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have NA for all three fields because the sample is from an autopsy (not allowed type), malignancy is uncertain, and no Gleason details are provided.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
