Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an autopsy specimen. Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says there's a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's stated that further inspection is needed and findings can't be reliably inferred. Since it's uncertain, the malignancy isn't confirmed. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows a format like "4+3=7." The text here doesn't mention any specific Gleason grades. There's a reference to adenocarcinoma being potential but not confirmed. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the findings are inconclusive and no malignancy is confirmed, all fields default to NA. The JSON structure should reflect that without any nesting.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
