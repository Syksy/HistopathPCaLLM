Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "the fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's uncertain because further inspection is needed. Since it's not confirmed, the malignancy isn't definitively present. So Malignancy should be NA here.

For Gleason grade, the example uses a format like "4+3=7." The text doesn't mention any specific Gleason grades. It only talks about possible adenocarcinoma but no confirmed malignancy. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's an autopsy, Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA since no grades are reported. The JSON should reflect these values without any nesting.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
