Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given report mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte", which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is typically abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that in all macro sections and other samples, there's mainly normal growth. They mention some atrophy, patchy inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no signs of malignancy. The summary also talks about mild inflammation and age-related changes, no mention of cancer. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The report doesn't list any Gleason grades because there's no cancer found. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings, which in this case are non-malignant. Double-checking the original text confirms there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason scores, so the answer seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
