Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report from a prostate sample and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte". I remember that "radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So here, the Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that in the microscopic examination, they see mostly normal tissue ("normaalia kasvustoa"). There's some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia, which are benign changes. The summary also mentions mild inflammation and age-related changes. Importantly, it says "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) in the seminal vesicles. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings, the Malignancy field should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy here, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. But in this case, there are no malignant lesions at all. So all fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm.

Yes, the key points are RP as sample type, no malignancy, so Gleason is NA. Everything checks out. Time to format the JSON accordingly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
