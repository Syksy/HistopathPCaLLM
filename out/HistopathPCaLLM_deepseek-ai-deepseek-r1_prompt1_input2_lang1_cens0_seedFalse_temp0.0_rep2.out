Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of a prostate sample and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. According to the allowed values, "RP" corresponds to radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that in the microscopic examination, they see mostly normal growth ("normaalia kasvustoa"). There's some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no mention of carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. The summary also mentions mild inflammation and age-related changes, no tumor tissue in the seminal vesicles or resection margins. So malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there's no cancer detected.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text to make sure I didn't miss any mentions of cancer or Gleason scores. Nope, looks like it's all benign findings. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
