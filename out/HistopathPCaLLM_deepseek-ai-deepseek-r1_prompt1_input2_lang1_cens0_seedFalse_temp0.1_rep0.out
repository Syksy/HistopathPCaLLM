Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte", which translates to "radical prostatectomy sample". So the sample type here is "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in the microscopic examination, they see mostly normal tissue, some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia. The summary mentions "korkeintaan lievä-asteista tulehdusta" (at most mild inflammation) and typical age-related changes. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason score here is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The example given doesn't include any nested elements, so the JSON should be straightforward. 

Double-checking the sample type: "radikaali prostatektomianäyte" definitely refers to RP. Malignancy is negative because no cancer is mentioned. Gleason isn't applicable here. All criteria seem to fit.
