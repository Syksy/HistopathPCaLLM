Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the sample is described as "radikaali prostatektomianäyte". "Radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions that in the microscopic examination, they see mostly normal growth, some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia. The summary states "korkeintaan lievä-asteista tulehdusta" (at most mild inflammation) and age-related changes. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So the Malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The example given helps confirm the structure. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes. The sample type is definitely RP. No malignancy detected, so Gleason is NA. Everything seems to fit the required structure.
