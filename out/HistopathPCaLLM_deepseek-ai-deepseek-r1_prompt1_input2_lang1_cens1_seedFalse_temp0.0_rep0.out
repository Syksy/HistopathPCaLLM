Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input text is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was "Prostata biopsiasta..." which became "biopsy". The current input is "Prostatan leikkausmateriaali, prostatektomia". The key term here is "leikkausmateriaali" which translates to surgical material, and "prostatektomia" is prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a common procedure, so I think the sample type here is RP.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum. The text says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7". So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7". The example also used this format, so that's straightforward.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The user specified only the worst lesion's results. Since the sample is from a prostatectomy, it's the definitive specimen, and the Gleason mentioned is the primary one reported. No other lesions are mentioned, so this is the one to include.

Double-checking the sample type: "leikkausmateriaali" and "prostatektomia" both point to RP (radical prostatectomy). Biopsy would be "biopsia", TURP is transurethral resection. So Sampletype is RP. Malignancy is confirmed by adenocarcinoma. Gleason is clearly stated as 4+3=7. All fields accounted for, no missing info. The JSON structure should be flat with these three keys.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
