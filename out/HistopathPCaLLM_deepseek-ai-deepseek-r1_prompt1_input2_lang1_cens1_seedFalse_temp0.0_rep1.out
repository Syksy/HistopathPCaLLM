Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." The key term here is "ruumiinavauksesta," which translates to autopsy. None of the allowed values match autopsy, so the Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa." The word "mahdollisen" means possible, so there's a suspicion but no confirmation. The allowed values are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since it's not confirmed, but there's a mention of possible malignancy, I need to check if the sample actually has malignant findings. The report states that current samples are limited for assessing possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. The conclusion is that further tests are needed. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says "nykyiset näytteet ovat vain rajallisesti käytettävissä mahdollisen adenokarsinooman...arvioinnissa." So the samples are insufficient to confirm malignancy. The existing findings include some atrophy and inflammation but no confirmed malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy reported. Or does "mahdollisen" imply uncertainty, so maybe NA? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they couldn't assess due to limited samples, but didn't find any malignancy in the current samples, then "ei". The report doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, just that more tests are needed. So "ei" is correct.

Third, Gleason. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with that.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (autopsy isn't listed), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in the sample), Gleason is NA.
