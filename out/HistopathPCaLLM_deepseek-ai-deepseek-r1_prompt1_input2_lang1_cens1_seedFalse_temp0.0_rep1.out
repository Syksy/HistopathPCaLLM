Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the example given, the sample was a biopsy. The input text here is "Prostata biopsiasta havaitaan adenokarsinoomaa Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." The key word here is "biopsiasta" which translates to biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The presence of "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) indicates a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided doesn't have any, so just a flat structure with the three keys. Also, only the worst lesion's results are to be reported. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward.

Double-checking the allowed values: Sampletype is correct as "biopsy". Malignancy is "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma is malignant. Gleason is properly formatted. No issues here. All fields are filled appropriately without any NAs since the information is present in the text.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
