Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report from a prostate sample and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each one carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Tuorenäyte" which translates to "fresh sample" and it's from a "ruumiinavaus" (autopsy). The original types allowed don't include autopsy, so I need to check if there's any mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't mention any of these procedures. The sample was given for examination from an autopsy, so none of the allowed values apply. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The summary mentions that the current samples are limited for evaluating possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. The key words here are "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman" (possible adenocarcinoma) and "muiden malignien muutosten" (other malignant changes). However, the report states that no conclusions can be drawn due to inflammation and age-related changes. There's no definitive evidence of malignancy found, just a mention that further tests are needed. Since it's not confirmed, but there's a suspicion, does that count as "kyllä"? Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says the samples are limited in assessing possible malignancy, but no actual malignancy is reported. The presence of inflammation and age-related changes is noted, but no malignancy is confirmed. So the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the sample doesn't show malignant findings, only that more tests are needed to check for possible ones. Alternatively, if the mention of possible malignancy is enough, but according to the example, if it's confirmed, then "kyllä". Since it's not confirmed, and the current samples don't show malignancy, "ei" is appropriate. But wait, the YHTEENVETO (summary) says that the samples are only limitedly usable for assessing possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. So the existing samples don't have enough evidence, but they can't rule it out. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they didn't find any, just that they can't assess it fully, the malignancy is not present in the sample. So "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. The example shows that when malignancy is present, Gleason is filled. Here, since malignancy isn't confirmed, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since it's an autopsy sample, not biopsy/RP/TURP), Malignancy is ei (no malignant findings reported), Gleason is NA.
