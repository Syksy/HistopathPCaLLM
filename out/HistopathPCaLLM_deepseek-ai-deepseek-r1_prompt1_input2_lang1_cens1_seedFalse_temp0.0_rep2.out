Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, which was translated to "biopsy". I need to look at the input text for keywords indicating the sample type. The input here is "Prostataresektio: ...". The term "resektio" in Finnish translates to resection. Now, RP stands for radical prostatectomy, which is a type of surgery, and TURP is transurethral resection of the prostate. Since the term here is "Prostataresektio", which is a resection, I think TURP is a type of resection. But I need to confirm. Wait, TURP is typically for benign prostatic hyperplasia, but radical prostatectomy (RP) is for cancer. However, the sample type here is a resection, so maybe it's TURP. But the Finnish term "Prostataresektio" might refer to RP if it's a radical resection. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check. In some contexts, "prostataresektio" can be either TURP or RP. But since the report mentions "prostataresektio" without specifying TURP, but given that the Gleason score is 4+3=7, which is a higher grade, it's more likely that this is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as TURP is usually for benign cases or when cancer is found incidentally. So I'll go with "RP" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 (Groupp I)". So the major pattern is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

Putting it all together, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Wait, but the user mentioned that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward. Also, the sample type: "Prostataresektio" is the term here. If "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, then that's correct. TURP is a different procedure. So yes, "RP" is the right choice here.
