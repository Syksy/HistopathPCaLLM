Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was a biopsy, and the input text here mentions "Prostataresektio." I need to recall what that translates to. "Resektio" is resection, which in prostate terms usually refers to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype should be RP here.

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "adenokarsinoomaa," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is definitely "kyllä."

Then the Gleason score. The format should be major+minor=sum. The text says "Gleason 4 + 3 = 7." I need to present that exactly as "4+3=7". Since there's a malignancy, we include this value. If there were no malignancy, it would be NA.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is from "Prostataresektio," which aligns with RP. The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. The Gleason score is clearly stated. No other lesions are mentioned, so we take the given values. All fields fit the required structure without nesting. Looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
