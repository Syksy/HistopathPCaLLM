Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided report, the first line says "Prostataresektio." I recall that "resektio" in Finnish translates to resection. TURP is a type of resection, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "ei pahanlaatuisia muutoksia," which means "no malignant changes." So the malignancy field should be "ei."

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score would be NA. Even if there were some mention of Gleason, if the malignancy is negative, Gleason is automatically NA according to the instructions.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and uses the exact allowed values. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "Prostataresektio" aligns with TURP, and the absence of malignancy is clear. All set.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
