Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was a biopsy, and the input text here mentions "Prostataresektio." I need to recall what that translates to. "Resektio" is resection, so RP stands for radical prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure. So "Prostataresektio" would correspond to RP. That's the first field done.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "ei pahanlaatuisia muutoksia," which means no malignant changes. So Malignancy should be "ei."

Then Gleason. The format is major+minor=sum. But since there are no malignancies, the Gleason score should be NA. The example showed that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected. So that's straightforward.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The output should be flat with these three keys. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm. Yes, no mention of any tumors or Gleason grading. All right, putting it all together.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
