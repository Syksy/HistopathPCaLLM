Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the samples were taken from "chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because that procedure often results in chip-like tissue fragments. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Even though there were uncertainties and artifacts, the consultants confirmed the diagnosis. So Malignancy should be "yes."

Now, Gleason grade. The example given uses "major+minor=sum." The text states the primary pattern is grade 4, secondary is 3, and tertiary is 5. However, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. Tertiary patterns are sometimes noted but the primary and secondary are the main ones. But there's a mention of updating the diagnosis from 3+3 to Grade Group 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. Even though there's a tertiary grade 5, the main Gleason score is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7."

Wait, but sometimes tertiary patterns are considered when they are higher. For example, if there's a tertiary 5, some systems might report the highest grades. But the user's example uses the major and minor, not including tertiary. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. However, the example given in the problem statement includes major and minor, not tertiary. Also, the updated diagnosis is Grade Group 3, which is 4+3=7. So the tertiary 5 might not be included here. The answer should follow the example's format, so "4+3=7" is correct.
