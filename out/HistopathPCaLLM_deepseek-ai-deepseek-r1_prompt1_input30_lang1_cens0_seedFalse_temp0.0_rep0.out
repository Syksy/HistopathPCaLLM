Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to "prostate biopsy". In the current case, the text refers to "lastuista saaduista", where "lastuista" likely means from chips or pieces, which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. However, the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "biopsiasta". But here, the term "lastuista" might indicate TURP. Wait, but the example uses "biopsy" for "biopsiasta". Let me check again. The current case says "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista". "Lastuista" could be from TURP, which often yields chips. But the example's "biopsy" is for "biopsiasta". However, the current text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says to determine the original sample type. The text here mentions "lisäkonsultaatio" which is a consultation, so maybe the original sample type isn't directly stated here. The example had "biopsy" because the text said "biopsiasta". Here, the text refers to "lastuista" which are chips, so that's TURP. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the sample is from a biopsy, but the term "lastuista" might refer to biopsy cores. Wait, in Finnish, "biopsia" is biopsy, and "TURP" would be "leikkaus" or "resektio". The term "lastu" is often used for TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP. But the example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. So in this case, since it's "lastuista", which are TURP chips, the sampletype should be "TURP". But let me check again. The text says "saaduista lastuista" which translates to "from the obtained chips". TURP is a procedure where chips are taken. So I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, the diagnosis was updated from "epävarma" (uncertain) to "keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi" (moderate adenocarcinoma), confirming malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So the primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and there's a tertiary 5. However, according to Gleason grading rules, if there's a tertiary pattern, the highest grade is added to the primary. But the user's instruction says to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) and not to have nested structures. The example in the problem used "4+3=7" even though there was a tertiary 5. Wait, in the example given by the user, the text had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" and the JSON was "4+3=7". But in the current case, the text mentions "luokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So the primary is 4, secondary 3, and tertiary 5. According to current Gleason grading, when a tertiary pattern is present, the grading is primary + highest of secondary/tertiary. So in this case, it would be 4 + 5 = 9. But the text says "päivitetään keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi (nyt siis Grade Group 3, aiempi GG 1)". Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason score 4+5=9 or 5+4=9, but Grade Group 3 is actually Gleason 4+4=8. Wait, no. Let me recall: Grade Group 1 is Gleason ≤6, Group 2 is 3+4=7, Group 3 is 4+3=7, Group 4 is 8, and Group 5 is 9-10. Wait, no. Wait, the Grade Groups are as follows:

Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6

Grade Group 2: Gleason 3+4=7

Grade Group 3: Gleason 4+3=7

Grade Group 4: Gleason 8

Grade Group 5: Gleason 9-10

But in the text, it says the previous diagnosis was 3+3 (GG1) and now it's updated to Grade Group 3. So Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. However, the text mentions a tertiary pattern 5. So how does that affect the Gleason score? According to current guidelines, if there's a tertiary pattern, the Gleason score is reported as the primary + the highest of the remaining patterns. So if it's 4 (primary), 3 (secondary), and 5 (tertiary), then the score would be 4 + 5 = 9. But the text says the Grade Group is now 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. This is conflicting. Wait, maybe the tertiary pattern is not considered in the Grade Group but only in the score. Or perhaps the tertiary is not the highest. Let me check the text again. The text says "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So primary 4, secondary 3, tertiary 5. But according to the rules, the tertiary pattern is only considered if it's higher than the secondary. In this case, tertiary 5 is higher than secondary 3, so the Gleason score would be 4 + 5 = 9. However, the Grade Group is 3, which is 4+3=7. This seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the tertiary pattern is not included in the Grade Group but is mentioned separately. The user's instruction says to report the worst lesion's Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format. So perhaps in this case, the main components are 4 and 3, and the tertiary 5 is not part of the sum but is noted elsewhere. However, the example given by the user included only the two main components even if there was a tertiary. Wait, in the example, the text had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" and the JSON was "4+3=7". So even if there's a tertiary, the example only took the two main. But in the current case, the text mentions "tertiäärinen 5". So according to the example's logic, should we take the two main (4 and 3) and ignore the tertiary? But the user's instruction says to take the worst lesion. Hmm. The user's instruction says: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). So perhaps the tertiary 5 is part of the worst lesion. But how to represent that. The standard way is to report the primary and the highest secondary grade. So if there's a tertiary 5, the Gleason score becomes 4 + 5 = 9. But the text says the Grade Group is 3, which is 4+3=7. This is confusing. Wait, maybe the tertiary 5 is in a small focus and the main components are 4 and 3. But according to the text, the diagnosis was updated from 3+3=6 (GG1) to now 4+3=7 (GG3), but there's a tertiary 5. However, the Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. So perhaps the tertiary 5 is not included in the main score but noted as a tertiary. But the user's instruction says to report the worst lesion. So maybe the correct Gleason here is 4+5=9. But the text says the Grade Group is 3, which is 4+3=7. This is conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the tertiary 5 is not part of the main score but the example in the problem didn't include the tertiary. The user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" and the sum was 7. So perhaps in this case, the main grades are 4 and 3, sum 7, and the tertiary 5 is mentioned but not included in the sum. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+3=7". But the text also mentions "tertiäärinen 5". However, the user's instruction says to report the worst lesion. If the tertiary 5 is part of the worst lesion, then the sum would be 4+5=9. But the Grade Group is 3, which is 4+3=7. So there's inconsistency here. Maybe the text is indicating that despite the tertiary 5, the main grades are 4 and 3, leading to GG3. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7". The tertiary 5 might be a minor component not affecting the main score. So I'll go with "4+3=7" as the Gleason, matching the Grade Group 3 mentioned in the text.
