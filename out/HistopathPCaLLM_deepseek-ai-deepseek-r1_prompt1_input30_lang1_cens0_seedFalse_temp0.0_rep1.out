Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to "prostate biopsy". In the current case, the text refers to "lastuista saaduista", where "lastuista" likely means from chips or pieces, which is typical in a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. However, the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "biopsiasta". But here, the term "lastuista" might indicate TURP. Wait, but the example uses "biopsy" for "biopsiasta". Let me check again. The current case says "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista". "Lastuista" could be from TURP, which often yields chips. But the example's "biopsy" is for "biopsiasta". However, the current text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says to determine the original sample type. The text here mentions "lisäkonsultaatio" which is a consultation, so maybe the original sample type isn't directly stated here. The example had "biopsy" because the text said "biopsiasta". Here, the text refers to "lastuista" which are chips, so that's TURP. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the sample is from a biopsy, but the term "lastuista" might refer to biopsy cores. Wait, in Finnish, "biopsia" is biopsy, and "TURP" would be "leikkaus" or "resektio". The term "lastu" is often used for TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP. But the example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. So in this case, since it's "lastuista", which are TURP chips, the sampletype should be "TURP". But let me check again. The text says "saaduista lastuista" which translates to "from the obtained chips". TURP is a procedure where chips are taken. So I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, the diagnosis was updated from "epävarma" (uncertain) to "keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi" (moderate adenocarcinoma), confirming malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So the primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and there's a tertiary 5. However, according to Gleason grading rules, if there's a tertiary pattern, the highest grade is added to the primary. But the user's instruction says to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) and not to have nested structures. The example in the problem used "4+3=7" even though there was a tertiary 5. Wait, in the example given by the user, the text had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" and the JSON was "4+3=7". But in the current case, the text mentions "vallitseva" (primary) 4, minor 3, and tertiary 5. According to current Gleason grading, when a tertiary pattern is present (e.g., in biopsy), the grading is primary + highest of the remaining. So if it's 4 + 3 with tertiary 5, the score would be 4 + 5 = 9. But the text here says "luokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". However, the example given by the user in the problem statement included a case where the sum was 4+3=7 even if there was a tertiary. Wait, but in the example, the tertiary wasn't mentioned. In the current case, the text says "tertiäärinen 5", which is a tertiary pattern. But the user's instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. So perhaps the tertiary is considered part of the worst lesion. However, the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". So maybe the primary and secondary are 4 and 3, but there's a tertiary 5. In some grading systems, when a tertiary higher grade is present, it's noted. But according to the example, the user expects the sum to be primary + secondary, even if there's a tertiary. Wait, in the example, the user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" and the JSON was "4+3=7". So the tertiary wasn't considered. But in the current case, the text mentions "tertiäärinen 5". However, the user's instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. So perhaps the tertiary 5 is part of the same lesion. But according to the current Gleason grading, in biopsies, the primary and secondary are the two most common patterns, and tertiary is the third. However, in radical prostatectomy specimens, tertiary patterns are considered. But the problem says to report the worst lesion. So if the main lesion is 4+3 with a tertiary 5, how should it be reported? The problem's example didn't include a tertiary, but here it's present. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset", so perhaps the highest possible sum. But the text here says "luokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So the primary is 4, secondary is 3, and tertiary 5. In some cases, the tertiary is considered, leading to 4 + 5 = 9. But the example given by the user didn't do that. However, the text here says "potilaan aiempi suhteellisen epävarma diagnoosi (3+3) päivitetään keskitasoiseksi adenokarsonoomaksi (nyt siis Grade Group 3, aiempi GG 1)". Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+5=9 or 5+4=9. Wait, Grade Group 3 is Gleason 4+4=8, but I might be mixing up. Let me check: Grade Group 1 is 3+3=6, Grade Group 2 is 3+4=7, Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7, Grade Group 4 is 8, and Grade Group 5 is 9-10. Wait, no. Wait, the Grade Groups are as follows:

Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6 (3+3)
Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3+4=7
Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4+3=7
Grade Group 4: Gleason score 8
Grade Group 5: Gleason score 9-10

So in the current case, the diagnosis was updated from 3+3 (GG1) to Grade Group 3, which is 4+3=7. But the text mentions "tertiäärinen 5". However, the Grade Group is now 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. So perhaps the tertiary 5 is not included in the sum for the Grade Group. Therefore, the Gleason score here is 4+3=7, and the tertiary 5 is noted but not added to the sum. Therefore, the correct Gleason would be "4+3=7".

But the text says "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So primary 4, secondary 3, tertiary 5. But according to the updated Grade Group system, tertiary patterns in biopsies are not included in the Grade Group but may be mentioned. However, the user's instruction says to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The tertiary 5 is mentioned but not added. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's from "lastuista", which are TURP chips)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma confirmed)
Gleason: 4+3=7 (as per the Grade Group update to 3, which is 4+3=7)

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
