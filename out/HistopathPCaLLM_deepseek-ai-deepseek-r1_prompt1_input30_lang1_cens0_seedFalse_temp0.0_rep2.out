Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which translates to "from prostate biopsy." So the original sample type is a biopsy. That's straightforward. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, there's a mention of updating the diagnosis to "keskitasoiseksi adenokarsonoomaksi" (moderate adenocarcinoma) and Grade Group 3. So definitely malignant. Malignancy is "kyllä".

Now, Gleason. The format should be major+minor=sum. The text says "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5." Vallitseva means dominant, so major pattern is 4, minor is 3. The sum is 4+3=7. However, there's also a tertiary grade 5 mentioned. But according to the instructions, only the worst (pahimman) lesion's results should be reported. In Gleason scoring, if there's a tertiary pattern, the current guidelines sometimes incorporate it, but the user specified to take the worst lesion. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the primary and secondary, not tertiary. The example had 4+3=7. Here, the main patterns are 4 and 3, with tertiary 5. But the user says to report the worst lesion. Wait, maybe the tertiary is considered part of the grading. However, the standard Gleason scoring for the total is primary + secondary. Tertiary is sometimes noted but not added. However, in some cases, if the tertiary is higher, it might affect the Grade Group. But the user's example didn't include tertiary. The instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which translates to the worst lesion's results. So perhaps the primary is 4, secondary 3, and tertiary 5. But the worst would be 5? Wait, but the main components are 4 and 3. Tertiary is a smaller component. However, the problem says to take the worst lesion. Wait, maybe the worst lesion here is the tertiary 5, but the main patterns are 4 and 3. But the example given in the problem uses the primary and secondary. The user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" which might mean the highest Gleason pattern present. But in the example, they used the primary and secondary. Hmm. Let me check the example again. The example sentence was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which became "4+3=7". So in that case, they took primary and secondary. So perhaps here, even though there's a tertiary 5, the main components are 4 and 3, so the sum is 4+3=7, and the tertiary is noted but not included in the sum. However, the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion" which could be the highest individual pattern. But in the example, they used the sum of primary and secondary. So maybe the answer here is 4+3=7, ignoring the tertiary 5. But the text also mentions that the previous diagnosis was 3+3 (GG1) and now it's updated to Grade Group 3. Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+4=8 or 3+5=8 or 5+3=8, but wait, Grade Groups are different. Let me recall: Grade Group 1 is Gleason ≤6, Group 2 is 3+4=7, Group 3 is 4+3=7, Group 4 is 8, and Group 5 is 9-10. So in the text, the previous was 3+3=6 (GG1), now it's 4+3=7 (GG3). The tertiary 5 might not affect the primary and secondary sum but could influence the Grade Group. However, the user is asking for the Gleason in the format major+minor=sum. So the major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The tertiary 5 is mentioned but not part of the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7". Even though there's a tertiary 5, the main components are 4 and 3. The user's example didn't include tertiary, so perhaps we follow that. Therefore, the answer is "4+3=7".
