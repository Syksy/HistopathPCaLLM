Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "kudosnäytteen" which translates to "tissue sample". However, the specific type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) isn't explicitly stated. The original report is a consultation, so maybe the sample type was mentioned in the original request, but here it's not specified. So I might have to put "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "epävarmojen löydösten vuoksi" (due to uncertain findings) and "epäilty poikkeavia löydöksiä" (suspected abnormal findings), but the experts couldn't confirm or reject the suspicions. Since there's uncertainty and no confirmation of malignancy, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. The instructions say to report "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. Here, it's unclear, so maybe "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä" for malignant, "ei" for benign, and "NA" if unknown. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there were suspicions, but not confirmed. The original report says they couldn't confirm or reject, so it's uncertain. Therefore, the malignancy field should be "NA" because it's not definitively yes or no.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports using "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy confirmed and no scores mentioned.
