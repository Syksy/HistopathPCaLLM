Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the patient had a routine systematic biopsy initially. Then, after symptoms, there were two targeted biopsies. The most recent and relevant sample here would be the second targeted biopsy since that's where the significant finding was. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions a large focus with primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5. Since Gleason 4 and 5 are part of a malignant tumor, the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The second targeted biopsy found primary pattern 4 and the secondary is 5. So that's 4+5=9. Even though the initial biopsy was 3+3=6, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which is the 4+5=9 from the second biopsy. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check the text again. The second biopsy is the most severe, and the Gleason there is 4 and 5. Yes, that's correct. The JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
