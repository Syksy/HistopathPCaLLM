Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the patient had a routine systematic biopsy and two targeted biopsies. The most recent and severe lesion would be from the second targeted biopsy. Since both are types of biopsies, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions a large focus with Gleason 4 and 5, which are malignant. So the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The second targeted biopsy has primary pattern 4 and the second most common is 5. So that's 4+5=9. Even though the previous was 3+3=6, the latest and most severe is 4+5=9.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, check that only the most severe lesion is considered. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
