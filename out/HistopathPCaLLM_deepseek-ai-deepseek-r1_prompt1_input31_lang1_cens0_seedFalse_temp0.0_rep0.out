Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies were done. However, one had a technical failure, but the other found a 10mm focus. So the samples are biopsies. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The report talks about "minimaalinen fokus 3+3=6 Gleason" which is a malignant finding. Then later, there's a focus with growth pattern 4 and the second most common being 5. Both 4 and 5 are part of Gleason scoring, indicating malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the instructions say to report the worst lesion. The initial mention is 3+3=6, but the text states that the previous Gleason 6 wasn't the worst. The new findings have mainly pattern 4 and the second most is 5. So the worst would be 4+5=9 or 5+4=9? Wait, the text says "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". So the primary is 4, secondary is 5. So sum is 4+5=9. The example uses "major+minor=sum", so major is the higher grade? Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (most prevalent) and the secondary (next most prevalent), regardless of which is higher. But the sum is primary + secondary. However, in cases where there are patterns 4 and 5, the current grading groups might consider the highest pattern, but according to the user's instruction, it's major (primary) + minor (secondary) = sum. So in this case, primary is 4, secondary is 5, sum 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, the text says "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" which means mainly growth pattern 4. Then "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common is 5). So primary is 4, secondary is 5. So sum is 4+5=9. Therefore, the correct Gleason is "4+5=9".

But the example given in the instructions was "4+3=7" where the primary is 4 and secondary 3. So the structure is major (primary) + minor (secondary) = sum. So yes, in this case, 4+5=9.

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: biopsy

Malignancy: kyllä

Gleason: 4+5=9

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The initial 3+3=6 is mentioned, but the text clarifies that the new finding is worse, so we take the 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
