Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies were done. However, one had a technical failure, but the other found a 10mm focus. So the samples are biopsies. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The report talks about "minimaalinen fokus 3+3=6 Gleason" which is a malignant finding. Then later, there's a focus with growth pattern 4 and the second most common being 5. Both 4 and 5 are part of Gleason scoring, indicating malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the instructions say to report the worst lesion. The initial mention is 3+3=6, but the text states that the previous Gleason 6 wasn't the worst. The new findings have mainly pattern 4 and the second most is 5. So the worst would be 4+5=9 or 5+4=9? Wait, the text says "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". So the primary is 4, secondary is 5. So Gleason sum is 4+5=9. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+5=9".

Wait, the text says "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" which is the major pattern, and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" which is the minor. So 4+5=9. That's the worst lesion now. The initial 3+3=6 is not the worst anymore. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since both systematic and targeted biopsies are biopsies)
Malignancy: kyllä (there's adenocarcinoma with Gleason scores)
Gleason: 4+5=9 (the worst from the latest findings)
