Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, there's "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies were done. One of the biopsies had a technical failure, but the other found a significant focus. Since the latest samples are biopsies, the Sampletype should be "biopsy". The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Biopsy fits here.

Next, malignancy. The report talks about a "minimaalinen fokus 3+3=6 Gleason" which is a malignant finding, even though it's minimal. Later, there's a more significant focus with patterns 4 and 5. So there are malignant findings. The Malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The initial mention is 3+3=6, but the text states that the previous Gleason 6 wasn't the worst. The new finding has "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (mainly growth pattern 4) and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common growth pattern 5). So the major is 4, minor is 5, sum 9. The correct format is "4+5=9". The latest finding overrides the initial 6, so that's the one to report.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is taken. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
