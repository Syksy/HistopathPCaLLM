Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text: "Potilas käynyt rutiinitarkastuksissa... kuvantamisen jälkeen otettiin tarvittavat näytteet." The mention of taking samples after imaging suggests it's a biopsy. The first sample had a technical failure, but others were taken. So Sampletype is "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says "Muissa näytteissä havaitaan epäilyttäviä löydöksiä, jotka kattavat näytteestä kuitenkin vain 5 %." Epäilyttäviä löydöksiä (suspicious findings) but it's unclear if they're malignant. The report mentions difficulty in interpretation and need for more samples. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe malignancy is "ei"? Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The instructions say for Malignancy, use "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the findings are suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, maybe "ei" isn't correct. Wait, the original example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's unclear. The text says "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" but they cover only 5% and interpretation is difficult. So maybe the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei"? Or is it NA? Hmm. The user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed as malignant, then maybe the answer is "ei" because malignancy isn't confirmed. Or perhaps "NA" if it's uncertain. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the sample has suspicious findings but not confirmed malignancy, maybe "ei" is safer? Or maybe the system should mark "kyllä" if there's any suspicion. Wait, no. The example had confirmed malignancy (adenocarcinoma). Here, it's unclear. The text says "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" but they are not confirmed. So Malignancy should be "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant. Or maybe "NA" if the presence of malignancy is not determined. The user's instruction says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, then the answer is "ei" because there's no definite malignancy. Alternatively, if the suspicious findings are considered as possible malignancy, but the report doesn't confirm, maybe "NA". But according to the example, when adenocarcinoma is present, it's "kyllä". Here, it's not confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? The user might expect "ei" if no malignancy is found, but here there are suspicious findings. Hmm. Maybe "ei" because the report doesn't state malignancy, just suspicious. So Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" in this case, Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, only that there are suspicious findings covering 5%. So no Gleason reported, hence "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
