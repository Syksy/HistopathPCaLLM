Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy. So the original sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" which is a type of malignant tumor. Even though later parts say the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear (benign), the main lesion here is the adenocarcinoma. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 4+4 pattern was observed particularly in the base of the prostate". There are other patterns mentioned (3+3, 3+4, 4+3), but the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The highest sum here is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The other patterns are less severe, so they're ignored. The lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being clear don't affect the main tumor's malignancy status. The answer should be in valid JSON without any extra fields or explanations.

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
