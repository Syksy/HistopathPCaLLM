Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided statement, the user mentions "samples from different locations" and "original primary prostate tissue." However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are from different batches and locations, but the type isn't specified. So, the Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant tumor findings. Since the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being clear typically indicates no spread of cancer, but the primary tissue's findings aren't directly stated here. However, the absence of mention of malignancy in the samples might lead to "no" or "NA". But since the primary tissue's examination results are mentioned to remain, but no malignancy is noted, perhaps "no" is appropriate. Wait, but the original primary prostate tissue's findings "remain" – does that mean they were previously found? The statement is a bit unclear. However, in the summary, the clear lymph nodes and seminal vesicles don't confirm the presence of malignancy in the prostate itself. Since there's no explicit mention of a tumor, the safest answer here is "no" for malignancy. But maybe "NA" if the primary tissue wasn't assessed here. Hmm. The user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. If there's no mention of malignancy, then "no" might be correct. Alternatively, if the primary tissue wasn't mentioned as having malignancy, but the other samples (lymph nodes) are clear, maybe the malignancy is "no". But the primary prostate's findings "remain" – perhaps they were previously malignant? The statement is a bit ambiguous. However, given the information here, since there's no direct mention of a malignant tumor, I think "no" is the answer. Wait, but the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. If there's no lesion mentioned, then malignancy would be "no". So, Malignancy: "no".

For Gleason grade, the allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since there's no mention of Gleason grades in the statement, and if malignancy is "no", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The samples are from different locations, but the type isn't specified. The lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, which might suggest that if there was a primary tumor, it hasn't spread, but the primary's findings "remain" – but without specifics. Since there's no mention of a tumor in the samples discussed, malignancy is "no". Therefore, the JSON should be as follows.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
