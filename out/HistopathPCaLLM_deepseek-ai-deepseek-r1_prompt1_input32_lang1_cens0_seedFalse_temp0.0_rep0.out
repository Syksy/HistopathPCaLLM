Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana..." which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined..." Then there are mentions of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. But the sample type for the current report seems to be from the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) and seminal vesicles (seminaalivehikkelit). However, the instructions say to take the original sample type. The initial procedure was a radical prostatectomy (RP), so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The lymph nodes (näytteet 1 and 2) and seminal vesicles (näytteet 3 and 4) are all clean: "puhtaat", "benignejä". However, the original prostate sample had adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores. But the task is to report the worst lesion's results. The original tumor had Gleason 4+4, which is the highest mentioned. But the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The samples being discussed here (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are clean, but the original prostate had malignancy. But the user's instruction says "näytteessä" (in the sample). The samples processed here are the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are benign. So Malignancy would be "ei" because the current samples don't have malignancy. But wait, the original sample (RP) had malignancy. The instructions might be a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example again. In the example, the sample was a biopsy with malignancy, so they reported "kyllä". Here, the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, but the original prostate had cancer. However, the task is to report based on the sample being processed. The first line says "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia... sittemmin otettu erilleen näytteeseen 1 viisi ja näytteeseen 2 kahdeksan imusolmuketta." So the samples now are the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are benign. So Malignancy is "ei".

Gleason: Since the current samples are benign, Gleason should be "NA". The original tumor had Gleason 4+4, but that's from the primary tumor, not the samples being processed here. The instructions say to report the Gleason only if there's malignancy in the sample. Since the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, Gleason is "NA".

Wait, but the user's example included Gleason even though the sample was a biopsy. So maybe the rule is that if the sample has malignancy, report the worst Gleason from that sample. In this case, the samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign, so Gleason is NA. The original prostate's Gleason isn't part of the current samples. So the answer would be Sampletype: RP, Malignancy: ei, Gleason: NA.
