Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana..." which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined..." Then there are mentions of lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) and seminal vesicles (seminaalivehikkelit) being sampled. But the instructions say to take the original sample type. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report states that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean ("puhtaat") with no signs of malignancy. However, the original prostate sample had "multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta" which is malignant. The question is whether the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) have malignancy. Since these new samples are clean, but the original had cancer, the instructions say to report the worst lesion. Wait, but the task says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". The worst lesion here is the original prostate with Gleason 4+4. But the current samples (the ones being processed) are benign. Wait, the sample type here is RP, which is the original prostatectomy. The report mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles (taken from the prostatectomy?) are now being examined. But the sample type is RP, which is the original. So the malignancy would be "kyllä" because the original sample had cancer. The current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are clean, but the main sample (RP) is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the original tumor had "gleason 4+4" as the highest mentioned. The text says "erityisesti basiksestä löytynyt gleason 4+4 tason kasvua, myös 3+3, 3+4 ja 4+3". So the worst is 4+4=8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" which would be the highest Gleason. So even though the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are negative, the original sample's worst is 4+4=8. So the answer should include that. The sample type is RP (the original prostatectomy), malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8.
