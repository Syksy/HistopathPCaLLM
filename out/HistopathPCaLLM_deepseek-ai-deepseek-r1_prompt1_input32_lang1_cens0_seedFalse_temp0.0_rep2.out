Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana..." which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined..." Then there are mentions of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. But the sample type for the current report seems to be from the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) and seminal vesicles (seminaalivehikkelit). However, the instructions say to take the original sample type. The initial procedure was a radical prostatectomy (RP), so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The lymph nodes (näytteet 1 and 2) and seminal vesicles (näytteet 3 and 4) are all clean: "puhtaat", "benignejä". However, the original prostate sample had adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores. But the task is to report the worst lesion's results. The original tumor had Gleason 4+4, which is the highest mentioned. But the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign. Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, but the original prostate had malignancy. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion's results should be returned). So even though the current samples are benign, the original sample (RP) had malignancy. But wait, the sample being processed here is the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are part of the RP? Or is the sample type RP, and the malignancy refers to the original tumor? The instructions might be a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example given. In the example, the sample was a biopsy, and the malignancy was present. Here, the sample type is RP, and the original tumor in the prostate had malignancy. However, the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). The samples 1,2,3,4 are from the RP, but they are lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. The original prostate had cancer, but those samples (the main tumor) are not the ones being discussed here. The report says "Alkuperäisestä multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta itse prostatassa..." which is the original tumor. The current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are clean. So the malignancy in the current samples (the ones being reported) is "ei". But the user instruction says to take the worst lesion. Wait, maybe the worst lesion overall, even if it's not in the current samples. The example given was a biopsy where malignancy was found, so the answer was "kyllä". Here, the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, but the original prostate had cancer. But the sample type is RP, which includes the prostate. Wait, the sample type is RP, which is the radical prostatectomy specimen. So the main tumor is part of the RP sample. However, the report mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles (which are part of the RP) are clean. But the original prostate (part of the RP) had cancer. So in the RP sample, there were malignant findings (the prostate itself) even though the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. Therefore, malignancy should be "kyllä". But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion's results should be returned). So the worst lesion is the original prostate's Gleason 4+4. Therefore, malignancy is "kyllä".

Gleason score: The original prostate had "gleason 4+4 tason kasvua, myös 3+3, 3+4 ja 4+3". The worst is 4+4=8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign, so if the malignancy is "kyllä" because the original prostate (part of the RP sample) had cancer, then Gleason is reported. But if the current samples (the ones being processed in this report) are the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which are benign, then malignancy would be "ei" and Gleason "NA". But the sample type is RP, which includes the prostate. So the entire RP sample includes the prostate, lymph nodes, and seminal vesicles. The report states that the prostate had cancer, but the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. Therefore, the overall malignancy in the RP sample is "kyllä" because the prostate part is malignant. Therefore, Gleason is the worst from the prostate, which is 4+4=8.

So the final answer should be:

Sampletype: RP (since the original sample was a radical prostatectomy)

Malignancy: kyllä (because the prostate part of the RP had cancer)

Gleason: 4+4=8 (the highest mentioned)
