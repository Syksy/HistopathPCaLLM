Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "PÄIVITYS: Potilaan näytteet eri erissä. Mediaanpituus oli 3cm ja pisin 5cm. Näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista." The key term here is "näytteet otettu" which translates to samples taken. The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text mentions "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" (original prostate tissue), but that's about the findings from macroscopic sections, not the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan. Yhteenvetona, imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat." The key points here are that the original prostate tissue findings remain valid, and lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. However, the original findings aren't detailed here. Since the current report doesn't mention any malignancy directly (like adenocarcinoma or cancer), and the previous findings are just noted as remaining valid without specifics, it's unclear. But since the task is to report based on the current sample, and there's no mention of malignancy here, maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the instructions say to consider only the worst lesion results. If the original findings (not detailed here) had malignancy, but the current samples (different locations) have varying results. However, the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. But without explicit mention of malignancy in the current samples, perhaps "ei" (no) or "NA"? Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a biopsy that found cancer. Here, the current samples' results vary, but the summary doesn't state malignancy. The original prostate tissue findings are mentioned but not their nature. Since the current report's summary doesn't indicate malignancy, maybe "ei" (no). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the original findings (which are not detailed here) had malignancy, but the current samples (different locations) might not. The problem is that the text is an update, and the original findings from the prostate tissue remain valid. If the original had malignancy, but the current samples (lymph nodes, seminal vesicles) are clean, then the malignancy would still be present. But the task is to report based on the sample in question. Wait, the sample type here isn't clear. The samples are from different locations, but the main prostate tissue findings are still valid. If the original sample (e.g., biopsy) had cancer, but the current samples (like lymph nodes) are clean, then the malignancy would still be "kyllä". But the problem is that the current report's samples (from different locations) have varying results, but the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. The original prostate findings (from previous samples?) remain valid. So perhaps the malignancy is present in the original prostate, but the current samples (which might be from other areas) don't show malignancy. However, the task is to report the worst lesion from the current samples. Since the current samples' results vary, but the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, maybe there's no malignancy in the current samples. But the original prostate findings (which could be malignant) are still valid. This is confusing. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion results from the samples being processed. If the current samples (the ones in this report) don't show malignancy, then "ei". But if the original prostate tissue (from a previous sample) had malignancy, but that's not part of the current samples, then maybe "ei". Alternatively, if the current samples include the original prostate tissue, but the findings from that are still valid (i.e., malignant), then "kyllä". But the text says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." So the original findings (from the prostate tissue) remain valid. If those original findings included malignancy, then the malignancy would still be present. But since the original findings are not detailed in this report, we can't assume they were malignant. The current report's samples (different locations) have varying results, but the summary states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. So perhaps there's no malignancy in the current samples, but the original prostate findings (if any) are not part of this sample. Since the task is to process the given lausunto (report), and the report doesn't mention malignancy in the current samples, but refers to original prostate findings remaining valid. However, without knowing the nature of those original findings, we can't determine malignancy from this report alone. Therefore, the answer might be "NA" for malignancy. Wait, but the example given in the instructions had a biopsy that found cancer. Here, the report is an update, mentioning that samples from different locations have varying results, but the original prostate findings remain valid. If the original findings were malignant, then the malignancy would still be "kyllä", but since the original findings are not specified here, maybe we can't determine it. The instructions say to extract from the given text. Since the given text doesn't explicitly state malignancy, but refers to previous findings, perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if the original prostate findings (which are valid) were malignant, then "kyllä", but since the text doesn't state that, maybe "NA". This is a bit ambiguous. The safest answer here is "NA" for malignancy because the current report doesn't explicitly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the samples being processed, only that previous findings remain valid, which we don't have details on.

Lastly, the Gleason score. If there's no malignancy ("ei" or "NA"), then Gleason is "NA". If malignancy is present, then we need to report the major + minor = sum. Since in this case, if malignancy is "NA" or "ei", Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't specified)
Malignancy: NA (since the report doesn't explicitly state presence/absence in current samples, and original findings are not detailed)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy is confirmed)
