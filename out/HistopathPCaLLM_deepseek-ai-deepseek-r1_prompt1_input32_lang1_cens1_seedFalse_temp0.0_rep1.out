Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "PÄIVITYS: Potilaan näytteet eri erissä. Mediaanpituus oli 3cm ja pisin 5cm. Näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista." The key term here is "näytteet otettu" which translates to samples taken. The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text mentions "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" (original prostate tissue), but that's about the findings from macroscopic sections, not the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan. Yhteenvetona, imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat." The key points here are that the original prostate tissue findings remain valid, and lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. However, the original findings aren't detailed here. Since the current report doesn't mention any malignancy directly (like adenocarcinoma or cancer), and the previous findings are just noted as remaining valid without specifics, it's unclear. But since the task is to report based on the current sample, and there's no mention of malignancy here, maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the instructions say to consider only the worst lesion results. If the original findings (not detailed here) had malignancy, but the current samples (different locations) have varying results. However, the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. But without explicit mention of malignancy in the current samples, perhaps "ei" (no) or "NA". But the problem is that the original findings are mentioned to remain valid. If the original findings had malignancy, but the current samples (different locations) might not. However, the user instruction says to take into account the worst lesion from the samples. Since the current samples have varying results, but the summary doesn't mention malignancy, maybe "ei" (no). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the original prostatakudoksesta had findings that included malignancy, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean. So maybe the malignancy is in the original prostate tissue, but the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are clean. But the sample type here is unclear. Wait, the sample type was NA, but the original sample (prostate tissue) might have had malignancy. However, the current report's samples are from different locations (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles), which are clean. So the malignancy would be "ei" because the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean. But the original prostate tissue findings remain valid. But the task is to report based on the samples processed here. Since the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, malignancy would be "ei". But the original prostate tissue (not part of the current samples?) might have had malignancy. This is a bit confusing. The user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion results should be returned). If the original prostate tissue had malignancy, but the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are clean, then the worst lesion would be from the original, but the current samples are different. However, the sample type here is unclear. Since the sample type is NA, maybe the malignancy is also NA. Alternatively, if the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, then malignancy is "ei". But the original prostate tissue findings (which are not part of the current samples) might have malignancy, but that's not part of the current samples. So perhaps the malignancy here is "ei" because the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean. But the original prostate tissue findings are separate. Hmm. This is tricky. The report says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." So the findings from the original prostate tissue remain valid. If those findings included malignancy, then maybe the malignancy is "kyllä", but the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are clean. But the task is to report based on the samples mentioned here. Wait, the user instruction says "Raakadata annetaan näiden ohjeiden lopuksi. Prosessoitavat syötteet ovat eturauhassyövän histopatologisia lausuntoja." So the input is a histopathology report. The current report mentions that the original prostate tissue findings remain valid, but the current samples (different locations) have varying results. The summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. So the malignancy in the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) is "ei", but the original prostate (which might be from a previous sample) had findings. But the task is to process the current report. Since the current samples (imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, malignancy would be "ei". However, if the original prostate tissue (which is part of the current samples?) had malignancy, but that's not clear. The sample type is NA, so maybe the malignancy is also NA. Alternatively, since the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are clean, malignancy is "ei". But the original prostate findings (if malignant) would be from a different sample. The user instruction says to take the worst lesion from the samples being processed here. If the current samples are from different locations and some have malignancy, but the summary says they are clean, then malignancy is "ei". But the text says "Tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen." So results vary between samples. But the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. So maybe some samples had malignancy, but the worst is still present? Wait, the instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (return the worst lesion results). If among the current samples, some have malignancy and others don't, then the worst would be malignant. But the summary says "imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat" (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles clean), which suggests no malignancy in those. The original prostate tissue findings remain valid, but if those are from a previous sample, maybe not part of the current ones. So perhaps the current samples (different locations) have varying results, but the summary indicates no malignancy. Therefore, malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. If malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". If malignancy were "kyllä", then we'd need to extract the Gleason. Since in this case, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (not specified)
Malignancy: ei (since current samples are clean)
Gleason: NA
