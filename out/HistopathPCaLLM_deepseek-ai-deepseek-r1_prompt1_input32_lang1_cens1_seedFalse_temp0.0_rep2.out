Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the original sample is mentioned as "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta". The term "alkuperäinen" translates to "original", but the sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" which means samples were taken from different locations, but without specifying the procedure. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista... jäävät voimaan" which implies that previous findings from macroscopic sections remain valid. However, the summary mentions "imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat" (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles clean). There's no direct mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy in the current samples. Since the previous findings are mentioned but the current samples don't show malignancy, but it's unclear if the original samples had malignancy. However, the user instructions say to consider the worst lesion's results. If the original samples (from the prostate tissue) had findings that are still valid, but the current samples (like lymph nodes) are clean, the malignancy might still be present. But the text doesn't explicitly state malignancy here. Since the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, but the original prostate findings are maintained. If the original had malignancy, then "kyllä", but if not, "ei". Since the original report isn't provided here, and the current text doesn't mention malignancy, maybe the answer is "NA". Wait, but the user said to take into account the worst lesion. If the original prostate tissue had findings that are still valid, but the current samples (lymph nodes, etc.) are clean, then the malignancy would be from the original. But without knowing the original's details, perhaps the answer is "kyllä" if the original had cancer. But the text here doesn't mention cancer. Hmm. The example given in the problem had "adenokarsinoomaa" which led to "kyllä". In this case, the current text doesn't mention any malignancy in the samples, only that previous findings from the prostate remain. If the original prostate had cancer, then malignancy is "kyllä", but since the current text doesn't state that, maybe it's "ei" or "NA". Wait, the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (the worst lesion's results should be returned). If the original prostate had findings that are still valid, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are clean, then the worst lesion would be from the original. But without knowing the original's malignancy status, maybe the answer here is "NA" because the current report doesn't mention malignancy, only that previous findings remain. But the original report's findings are not detailed here. This is a bit ambiguous. Since the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivesikkelit) are clean, but the original prostate's findings are maintained, but the original's findings aren't specified here. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because the current samples are clean, but the original might have had something. Wait, the example given in the problem had a biopsy sample with adenocarcinoma, leading to "kyllä". Here, the original prostate tissue's findings are maintained, but if the original was benign, then malignancy would be "ei". But since we don't have the original's details, perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, if the original had cancer, then "kyllä", but since it's not stated, maybe "NA". This is tricky. The text says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." So the findings from the original prostate tissue remain valid. If those findings included malignancy, then "kyllä", but if not, "ei". Since the current text doesn't specify what those findings were, perhaps malignancy is "NA". But the user wants the worst lesion. If the original had malignancy, then "kyllä", but we don't know. So maybe the answer here is "NA" for malignancy.

Third, Gleason grade. Since malignancy is "NA" or "ei", the Gleason would be "NA". If malignancy were "kyllä", then we need to look for Gleason scores. The current text doesn't mention any Gleason grades. So regardless, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA" because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is "NA" because we don't know the original findings' details, only that they remain. Gleason is "NA" as no grades are mentioned.
