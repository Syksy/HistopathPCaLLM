Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate..." So the sample type here is definitely RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions "One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes..." which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants it in the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3". Here, there's a bit of ambiguity. The Gleason grades can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. In Gleason scoring, the higher grade is considered more severe. So between 3+4 and 4+3, 4+3 is worse because the primary pattern is 4 (which is higher than 3). Therefore, the correct Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values should be top-level. Also, check if there's any mention of other sample types or conflicting info, but the report clearly states radical prostatectomy, so RP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed by tumor presence and lymph node involvement. Gleason is 4+3=7 as the most severe. No other lesions mentioned are more severe than that.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
