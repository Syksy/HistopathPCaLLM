Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate..." So the sample type here is definitely RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions "One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes..." which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The user prefers the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". This seems a bit ambiguous because it lists two possibilities. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the latter (4+3) is considered higher grade because the primary pattern is 4, which is more aggressive. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value structure, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. No other parts of the report mention benign findings, so no conflicts there. The seminal vehicles have no malignancy, but the main tumor is malignant, so overall malignancy is yes. That's all. The JSON should look like the example but with these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
