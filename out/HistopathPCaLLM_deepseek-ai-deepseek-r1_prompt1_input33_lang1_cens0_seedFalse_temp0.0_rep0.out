Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti". I know that "radikaalipostatetoktomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia" which means the tumor has penetrated the capsule, indicating malignancy. Also, there's a mention of "maligneja löydöksiä" in the lymph nodes (1/4). So the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". This indicates some variation between 3+4 and 4+3. The instructions specify to take the worst lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the primary pattern (major) is the higher one. So 4+3=7 is worse than 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are correctly mapped to the allowed options. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. Everything seems to fit the required format.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
