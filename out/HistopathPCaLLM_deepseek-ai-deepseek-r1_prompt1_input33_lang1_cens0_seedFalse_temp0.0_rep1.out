Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text starts with "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti..." Radikaalipostatetoktomia translates to radical prostatectomy, so the sample type should be "RP". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia" which means the tumor has penetrated the capsule. Also, there's a mention of a positive lymph node ("imusolmukkeissa yksi löydös (1/4, N1)"). So clearly malignant findings are present. The answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the report says "kapselin reuna-alueella kasvutapa vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". This indicates the major and minor patterns vary between 3+4 and 4+3. But the instruction says to take the worst (pahin) lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the sum is the same, but 4+3 is considered higher grade. So the correct format is "4+3=7".

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the exact numbers mentioned. The text here says "vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". Since both are mentioned, but we need the worst, which is 4+3. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Double-checking the other parts: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. The other details like T3b or lymph nodes are not required for these fields. The seminaalivehikel findings are negative, but since there's already a malignant finding (tumor and lymph node), malignancy is still "kyllä".

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
