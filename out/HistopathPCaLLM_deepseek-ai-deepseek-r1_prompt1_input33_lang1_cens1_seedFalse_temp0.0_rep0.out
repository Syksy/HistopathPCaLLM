Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The key term here is "näytteet" which translates to samples. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text mentions "imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä" which refers to lymph nodes processed in macro sections. But there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the sample type isn't specified, I should go with NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, in the seminal vesicles, there are no malignant findings. However, earlier it mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista" which are abnormal findings in the lymph nodes. But does "epänormaalit" equate to malignant? The key here is that the user specified to consider only the worst lesion. The report says there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles, but what about the lymph nodes? The term "epänormaalit" might not necessarily mean malignant. Since it's explicitly stated that there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles and the lymph nodes are abnormal but not confirmed as malignant, the overall malignancy would be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum. However, since Malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with the absence of malignancy.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
