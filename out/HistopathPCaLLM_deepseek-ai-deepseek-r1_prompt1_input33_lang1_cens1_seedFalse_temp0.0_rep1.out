Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text pathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The term "näytteet" (samples) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." This translates to "No malignant findings in the seminal vesicles." However, earlier it mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä." So there are abnormal findings in the lymph nodes, but it's not clear if those are malignant. The key part is "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" (No malignant findings) in the seminal vesicles, but what about other areas? The text says "vaihtelevat" (vary) in pathological findings. However, the user instructions specify to consider only the worst lesion. Since the explicit mention is "Ei maligneja" in seminal vesicles, but other areas might have abnormalities. Wait, but the user wants the presence of any malignancy. The text says "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" in seminal vesicles, but does it say anything
