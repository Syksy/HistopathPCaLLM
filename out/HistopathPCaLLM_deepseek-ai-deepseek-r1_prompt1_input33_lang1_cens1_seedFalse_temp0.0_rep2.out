Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text pathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The term "näytteet" (samples) is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text also mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä." "Makroleikkeissä" might refer to macroscopic sections, but that doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Since there's no explicit mention, I think the sample type should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, in the seminal vesicles, there are no malignant findings. However, earlier it mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista" (abnormal findings in lymph nodes). But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. The key here is whether the abnormal findings in lymph nodes are malignant. The term "maligneja" is explicitly denied in the seminal vesicles, but the lymph node findings are described as "epänormaalit" (abnormal). However, "malignancy" in the question refers to whether there were any malignant findings in the sample. Since the report says "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" (no malignant findings) in the seminal vesicles, and the other findings are in lymph nodes but not explicitly stated as malignant, maybe the malignancy is "ei". But wait, the lymph nodes are mentioned as having abnormal findings. Are those considered malignant? The text doesn't use the word "maligne" for them. So perhaps the answer is "ei" because there's a direct statement of no malignancy in the seminal vesicles, and the other findings aren't specified as malignant. But I need to be careful here. The user instructions say to consider the worst lesion. If the lymph nodes have abnormal findings but aren't confirmed as malignant, maybe the malignancy is "ei". Alternatively, if "epänormaalit" implies malignancy, but the text doesn't state it. Since the explicit statement is "Ei maligneja löydöksiä", maybe the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of malignancy (assuming malignancy is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention Gleason scores, so even if there were some abnormalities, without malignancy, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy.
