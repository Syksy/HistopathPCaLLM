Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes..." The term "sample" is mentioned, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of "tissue casettes" might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, since it's not explicitly stated, maybe the safest answer here is NA.

Next, determining malignancy. The statement says, "Findings do not indicate prostatic." Wait, that might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "prostatic carcinoma"? The next part says "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." Hyperplasia is usually benign. So, since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy indicators, the malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, the example shows that if it's benign, we put NA. Since the malignancy is "no", Gleason would be NA. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with that.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "no", and Gleason is NA.
