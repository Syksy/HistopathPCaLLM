Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of a prostate sample and extract specific structured data into JSON format. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "7.5gr resekaattia josta valmistettu 7gr kuudeksi kudoskasetiksi." The term "resekaattia" likely refers to resection, and "kudoskasetiksi" translates to tissue cassettes. TURP is a type of resection, so the sample type here is probably TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states: "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan... ei mitään malignia." This clearly indicates no malignancy. So the Malignancy field should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there's no cancer detected.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure follows the example, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results. Everything checks out here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
