Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näyte painaa 7.5gr, joka on valmisteltu kuudelle kudoskasetille kokonaispainoltaan 7gr." The mention of "kudoskasetille" (tissue cassettes) might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not sure. However, RP (radical prostatectomy) samples are usually larger, and TURP (transurethral resection) samples are also typically more substantial. The weight here is 7.5 grams, which is a bit ambiguous. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, but sometimes multiple cores can add up. However, the weight here is higher than typical biopsies. Wait, maybe the sample is from a TURP? But the text doesn't mention TURP specifically. Alternatively, maybe it's a prostatectomy. But the weight of 7.5 grams is low for a whole prostate, which is usually around 20-30 grams. Hmm. The text also says "kokonaispainoltaan 7gr" which is total weight prepared. Maybe the original sample was 7.5gr, but prepared into 7gr. I'm a bit confused. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since the text doesn't explicitly mention the procedure type, maybe it's NA. But sometimes in reports, the sample type is inferred. For example, if it's a biopsy, they might mention cores. Here, it's prepared into six cassettes, which could be a biopsy with multiple cores. Alternatively, TURP chips are often processed into cassettes. But without clear terms like "biopsia" (biopsy) or "prostatektomia" (prostatectomy), it's safer to go with NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." (Findings do not indicate prostate). Wait, maybe that's a translation error. Let me check the original Finnish. The user wrote: "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen. Hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta kroonisella inflammaatiolla nähdään." So, the findings don't indicate prostate...? Wait, maybe it's a typo. Perhaps it should be "eivät viittaa eturauhassyöpään" (do not indicate prostate cancer). But as written, "eivät viittaa eturauhasen" would mean "do not point to the prostate", which doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a mistake, and the intended meaning is that the findings are not indicative of malignancy. The report mentions "hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta" (hyperplastic prostate tissue) with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, or malignancy indicators. So malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score: Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign findings.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA.
