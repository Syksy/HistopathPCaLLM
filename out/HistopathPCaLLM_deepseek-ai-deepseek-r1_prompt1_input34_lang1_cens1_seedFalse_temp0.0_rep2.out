Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näyte painaa 7.5gr, joka on valmisteltu kuudelle kudoskasetille kokonaispainoltaan 7gr." The word "näyte" means sample, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states: "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." (Findings do not indicate prostate cancer.) Also, there's mention of hyperplastic tissue with chronic inflammation, which is benign. So Malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be "NA" as per the instructions. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which aligns with the benign findings.

I need to make sure there's no mention of any malignant terms like adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, or Gleason patterns. The findings here are hyperplastic and inflammatory, which are non-cancerous. So all three fields are correctly filled as NA, ei, and NA respectively.
