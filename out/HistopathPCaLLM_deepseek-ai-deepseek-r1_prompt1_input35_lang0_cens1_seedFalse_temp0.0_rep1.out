Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are from left and right lobe." The term "samples" is a bit generic. The report mentions "left and right lobe," which could be from a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, since there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should default to NA.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says there's "small high-grade PIN-changes." PIN stands for Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia. High-grade PIN is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, which would indicate malignancy, the answer here should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "no," the Gleason field should be NA. Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, if the malignancy is no, it's NA. In this case, there's no mention of Gleason scores, so that's another reason for NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is no because there's no cancer, just PIN and hyperplasia. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy and no Gleason reported.
