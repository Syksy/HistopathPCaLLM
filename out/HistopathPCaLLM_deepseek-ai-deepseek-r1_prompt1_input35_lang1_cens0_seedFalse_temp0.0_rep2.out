Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format based on three specific fields. Let me start by understanding the requirements thoroughly.

First, the three fields to extract are:
1. Sampletype: which can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA".
2. Malignancy: "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA".
3. Gleason: in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA".

The example given helps clarify the expected output. Now, looking at the provided report:

"Näytteenä 1-6 on edustavat biopsiat oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta. Yhdessä paikassa vasemmalla puolella näkyy pieniä korkean asteen PIN-muutoksia. Ei nähdä perineuraalista invaasiota. Oikealla puolella joitakin kudosrakenteita, jotka edustavat hyperplasiaa. Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta."

Translating the key parts: The samples 1-6 are biopsies from the right and left lobes. On the left, there's high-grade PIN (which is a pre-malignant condition), but no perineural invasion. On the right, some hyperplastic structures (hyperplasia is benign). No signs of carcinoma.

So, for Sampletype: The first sentence mentions "biopsiat", so the sample type is biopsy. That's straightforward.

Malignancy: The report states "Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta" which means no signs of carcinoma. Also, PIN is not considered malignant; it's a pre-cancerous lesion. So malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason: Since there's no carcinoma, Gleason score isn't applicable. So "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. All criteria seem to be met here.
