Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Näytteet vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta." The word "näytteet" translates to samples, and "lohkosta" refers to lobes. The sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since there's no specific procedure stated, I should go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The report mentions "korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia" which is high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). High-grade PIN is considered a pre-malignant condition but not outright cancer. The other findings are hyperplasia and some tissue formations, which are benign. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, the malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is "ei" here, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" as there's no cancer. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy.
