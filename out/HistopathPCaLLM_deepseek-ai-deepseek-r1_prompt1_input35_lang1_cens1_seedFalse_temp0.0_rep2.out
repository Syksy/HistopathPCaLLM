Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Näytteet vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta." The word "näytteet" translates to samples, and it mentions left and right lobes. The term "biopsiasta" (from biopsy) was in the example, but here there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since the sample type isn't specified, I should go with NA for the first field.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The text mentions "korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia" (high-grade PIN changes). PIN stands for Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia. High-grade PIN is considered a pre-malignant condition but isn't cancer itself. Then there's "hyperplasiaan" (hyperplasia), which is benign. The report doesn't mention adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So, malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion is considered. The answer here doesn't have any malignant findings, so all criteria are met.
