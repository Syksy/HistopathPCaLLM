Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the raw data: "prepared 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes." Hmm, the mention of macro cassettes might be a clue. Wait, "macro cassettes" are often used in TURP specimens. Also, the preparate weighs 80gr, which is quite large. Biopsy samples are usually smaller. RP (radical prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate, but TURP (transurethral resection) specimens can also be sizable. The size here is 7x6x5 cm. TURP samples are typically chips, but sometimes they can be larger. However, the weight of 80 grams is more in line with a TURP. Biopsy samples are much lighter. So Sampletype might be TURP here. But I need to check if there's a direct mention. The report doesn't explicitly say TURP, but the weight and preparation suggest it. Alternatively, if it's a resection, maybe. But since the options are limited, I'll go with TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The report states "No signs of malignity or inflammation." So Malignancy should be "no".

Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that for benign cases, Gleason is NA. So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of any other sample type. The preparate's weight and size, along with the cassettes, point to TURP. No mention of biopsy or RP. So the JSON should reflect that.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
