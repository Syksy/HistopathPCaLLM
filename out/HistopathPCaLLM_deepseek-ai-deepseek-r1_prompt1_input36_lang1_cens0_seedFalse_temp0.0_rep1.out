Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as weighing 80 grams and measuring 7x6x5 cm. Radical prostatectomy specimens are usually larger, like whole prostates, which can weigh around 30-50 grams normally, but cancer cases might be larger. An 80-gram prostate would be quite enlarged, possibly from BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). TURP specimens are usually smaller chips. However, the mention of preparing 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes suggests a larger specimen, which might be an RP. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, TURP can also generate multiple cassettes, but the size here is 7x6x5 cm, which is a whole prostate. So Sampletype is likely RP.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." That translates to "No malignancy or inflammation was found." So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise NA. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The sample is large, prepared into multiple cassettes, which fits RP. No mention of biopsy or TURP. The report says no malignancy, so Gleason isn't applicable. Yep, that seems right.
