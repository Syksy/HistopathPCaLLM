Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Preparaatti painaa 80 grammaa ja on kooltaan noin 7 x 6 x 5 cm." The weight and size here are quite large. Biopsy samples are usually small, while RP specimens are the entire prostate, which would be heavier. TURP specimens are from the procedure that removes part of the prostate, but they might not weigh as much as 80 grams. So, 80 grams and the dimensions suggest it's likely an RP specimen.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." That translates to "No malignancy or inflammation was found." So, the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, the instruction says to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable. Also, confirming that the sample type is correctly identified based on weight and size. Biopsy samples are much smaller, so RP makes sense here.
