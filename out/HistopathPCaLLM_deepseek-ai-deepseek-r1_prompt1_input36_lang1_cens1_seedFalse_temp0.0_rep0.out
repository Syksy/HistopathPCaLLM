Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of a prostate sample and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The mention of "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" (macro cassettes and normal cassettes) is a bit tricky. These terms are related to how tissue samples are processed. Biopsies are usually small and might be put in cassettes, but RP and TURP are larger specimens. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention surgery like RP or TURP. The original sample type isn't clearly stated here. So maybe the sampletype is NA because it's not specified whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Makroskooppisesti tutkittaessa näytteistä löydettiin nodulaarista hyperplasiaa, mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan." Nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia are typically benign conditions. However, the last part mentions that they couldn't reliably assess, but there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So the malignancy should be "ei" (no), unless the uncertainty implies something else. But since there's no direct mention of cancer, it's safe to say "ei".

Gleason score is required only if malignancy is present. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
