Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of a prostate sample and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided report, the sample mentions "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The terms "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" refer to how the sample was prepared, but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states "Mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan." Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number, which is typically benign. However, the phrase "ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan" means they couldn't reliably assess. But the key point is whether there's any mention of malignancy. The report doesn't mention adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The findings here are hyperplasia, which is benign. So, Malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. There's no mention of Gleason grades in the report, which aligns with the benign finding.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the worst lesion's results are included. In this case, since there's no malignancy, all fields related to it are NA. The sample type isn't specified, so that's NA too. The answer should be straightforward based on the provided data.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
