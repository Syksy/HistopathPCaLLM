Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." The term "electrosection chippings" makes me think of TURP, since that procedure often uses electrocautery to remove tissue, especially in cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, determining malignancy. The statement mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "findings indicate hyperplasia." Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer. So Malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, since the findings are benign (hyperplasia), there wouldn't be a Gleason score reported. The allowed value here is "NA."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Also, the example uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that format.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
