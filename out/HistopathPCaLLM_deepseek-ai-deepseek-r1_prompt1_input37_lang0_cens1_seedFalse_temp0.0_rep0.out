Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into specific JSON fields. First, I need to identify the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "total sample material preparated" but doesn't specify the type like biopsy or RP. So, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and mentions minor inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant tumor findings. So, Malignancy would be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no indication of malignancy, the value should be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. So putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. Need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but here there's no lesion mentioned. So the final answer should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
