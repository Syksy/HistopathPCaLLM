Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Less than half of the total sample material preparated." The term "sample material" is mentioned, but it doesn't specify the type. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in places." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant tumor. The example had "adenocarcinoma" leading to "yes." Here, since there's no indication of malignancy, Malignancy should be "no" or maybe NA? Wait, the instructions say "NA" is allowed. But if the examination didn't find malignancy but also didn't conclude it's benign, maybe. However, the text says "Further examination was not possible at this time," so maybe the current findings don't show malignancy. Since there's no mention of malignant findings, the answer should be "no." But I need to check if "no" is allowed when there's no malignancy found. The example used "yes" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, since there's no mention of malignancy, Malignancy should be "no."

Third, Gleason grade. The example used "4+3=7" when Gleason grades were mentioned. In the given text, there's no mention of Gleason grades. The statement talks about inflammation and partial nodular glands but no tumor grading. Since there's no malignant finding, Gleason should be "NA."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "no" because there's no mention of cancer. Gleason is NA because there's no tumor reported.
