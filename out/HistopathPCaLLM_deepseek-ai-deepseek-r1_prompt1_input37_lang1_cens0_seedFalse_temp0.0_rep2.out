Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Preparaattina 7g elektrosektiolastuja." The term "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to electroresection chips, which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "hyperplasia," which is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The findings here are benign, so malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since the sample is benign, the value should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3, 4, or 5, which are typical in adenocarcinoma cases. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and follows the syntax exactly as in the example. Let me double-check the terms to confirm. Yes, elektrosektio refers to TURP, hyperplasia is benign, and no Gleason mentioned. All set.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
