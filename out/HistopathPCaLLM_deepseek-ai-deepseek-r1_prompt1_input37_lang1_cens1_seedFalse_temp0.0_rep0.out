Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Alle puolet mahdollisesta näytemateriaalista valmisteltuna." The term "näytemateriaalista" translates to sample material. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't specified, so I should put "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Histologisessa tarkastelussa nähdään eturauhaskudosta, jossa osittain nodulaarisia rauhaskomponentteja. Paikoittain vähäistä inflammaatiota." This translates to observing prostate tissue with partially nodular gland components and some inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The user instructions say that if there are no malignant findings, Malignancy should be "ei". However, the note also says that the samples will be examined more thoroughly next week. But since the current report doesn't indicate malignancy, the answer should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the instructions specify that it should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't mentioned)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found in current report)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
