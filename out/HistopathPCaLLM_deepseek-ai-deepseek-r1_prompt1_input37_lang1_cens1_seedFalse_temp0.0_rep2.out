Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are given, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Alle puolet mahdollisesta näytemateriaalista valmisteltuna." The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text refers to "näytemateriaalista" (sample material) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I might have to go with NA here since there's no clear indication.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "eturauhaskudosta, jossa osittain nodulaarisia rauhaskomponentteja. Paikoittain vähäistä inflammaatiota." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The terms used are about glandular components and slight inflammation, which are benign. So malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum. But since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grading, which aligns with the absence of malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested objects and uses the exact allowed values. Let me double-check the example given. The example had "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". So in this case, since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The sample type isn't mentioned, so NA. Malignancy is "ei". That should be correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
