Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Representative samples are collected." The term "representative samples" is a bit vague. It doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type isn't mentioned here. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation." Hyperplasia is usually benign, not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be NA. The example given uses NA for benign cases, so that fits here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the original statement again to confirm there's no mention of any malignant terms or Gleason scores. Yep, looks like it's all benign findings. So the structured data should reflect that.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
