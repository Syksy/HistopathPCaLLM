Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä, joiden kokonaismitta annettuna millimetreissä." The key term here is "kudosnäytteitä", which translates to tissue samples. However, the original sample type isn't specified. The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota." Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as ei, and Gleason as NA. Let me double-check the original text to make sure I didn't miss any terms related to cancer. The terms are hyperplastista (hyperplastic, which is benign) and kroonista inflammaatiota (chronic inflammation). No mention of cancer, so yes, malignancy is "ei". Sample type isn't specified, so NA. Gleason isn't applicable here.
