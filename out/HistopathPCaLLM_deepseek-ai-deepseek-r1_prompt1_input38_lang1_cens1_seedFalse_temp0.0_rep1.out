Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä, joiden kokonaismitta annettuna millimetreissä." The term "kudosnäytteitä" translates to tissue samples, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states: "Histologisesti nähdään muun muassa hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota." Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant features. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and using the exact allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
