Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation..." The term "prostatectomy" here is key. Since it's a prostatectomy specimen, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The report mentions "a tumor with 3 foci" and discusses Gleason grades. The presence of a tumor with Gleason grading indicates malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report states "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." Here, major is 3 and minor is 4, summing to 7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but the text mentions three foci but specifies the Gleason for those, so that's the primary one. Also, no nested structures in the JSON. Check for any other possible sample types or conflicting info, but the terms here clearly point to RP. No mention of benign findings, so malignancy is yes. Gleason is correctly formatted as major+minor=sum. Alright, that should cover it.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
