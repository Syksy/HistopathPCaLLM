Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The key fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "prostatectomy preparate." Since a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, the sample type here would be RP. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor with 3 foci." The presence of a tumor, especially with Gleason grading, indicates malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum." The text says "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." Here, major is 3 and minor is 4, summing to 7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7."

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but the report mentions three foci with the same Gleason score, so there's no more severe one than the others. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, which it doesn't in the example.

Double-checking each part: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All values fit the allowed options. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. The tumor is present, so yes. Gleason is properly formatted. Looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
