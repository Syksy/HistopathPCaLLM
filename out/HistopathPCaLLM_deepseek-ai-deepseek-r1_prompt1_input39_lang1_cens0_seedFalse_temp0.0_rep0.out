Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The input text starts with "Tutkittavana prostatektomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "löydetään kasvain" which means a tumor was found. Also, they talk about Gleason grades, which are indicators of cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text says "Gleason 3 (major) että 4" and "Gleason grade 7". The major is 3 and minor is 4, so the sum is 7. The format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example uses "major+minor=sum", so even though there are three foci, the highest grades are 3 and 4. The answer should be "3+4=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
