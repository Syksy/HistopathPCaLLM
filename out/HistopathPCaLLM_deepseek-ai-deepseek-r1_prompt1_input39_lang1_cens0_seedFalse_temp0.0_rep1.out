Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tutkittavana prostatektomiapreparaatti". The term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which in medical terms usually refers to a radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since "prostatektomiapreparaatti" is the sample here, the sample type should be RP. So Sampletype is "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The report states "löydetään kasvain" which means a tumor was found. Additionally, it mentions Gleason grades 3 and 4, which are indicative of malignancy. The allowed values here are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since there's a tumor with Gleason scores, Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason grade. The text says "Gleason 3 (major) että 4" and "Gleason grade 7". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 3 and minor is 4, summing to 7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions three foci, but the highest Gleason is 3+4=7, which is correctly captured. No other higher grades are mentioned. Also, the sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy, not a biopsy or TURP. The malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason score is properly formatted. Everything seems to fit the required structure.
