Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" makes me think of TURP because TURP often results in small tissue fragments or chips. Biopsy samples are usually cores, not chippings. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, malignancy. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So Malignancy is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given uses NA for benign cases.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but here there's no malignancy, so that's straightforward.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
