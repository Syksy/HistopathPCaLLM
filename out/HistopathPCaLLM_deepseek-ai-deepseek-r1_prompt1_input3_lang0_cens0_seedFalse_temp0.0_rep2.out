Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" is commonly associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed in small pieces. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So the Malignancy field should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given also uses "NA" for benign cases.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "no", and Gleason as "NA". I need to make sure there's no nesting and the values are exactly as allowed. Let me double-check the terms to confirm. Yes, TURP is correct here, and the absence of malignancy aligns with the statement. Gleason isn't applicable here, so NA fits.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
