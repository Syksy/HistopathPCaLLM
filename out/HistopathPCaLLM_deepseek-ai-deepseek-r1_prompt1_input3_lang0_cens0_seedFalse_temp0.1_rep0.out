Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the raw data: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" is commonly associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is resected in small pieces. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So the answer here is "no". The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since they explicitly state no malignancy, that's straightforward.

For Gleason grade, the instruction says to use "major+minor=sum" format for malignant cases or NA if benign. Since malignancy is no here, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so no Gleason applies. 

Double-checking the terms: "prostate chippings" definitely points to TURP. The absence of malignancy is clear. No mention of any Gleason grading because there's no cancer found. Everything seems to fit the allowed values. Alright, time to structure the JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
