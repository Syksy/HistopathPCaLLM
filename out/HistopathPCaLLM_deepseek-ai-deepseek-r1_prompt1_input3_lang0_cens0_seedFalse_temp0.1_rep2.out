Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" makes me think of TURP because that procedure often results in small tissue fragments or chips. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, malignancy. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So Malignancy is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The example given uses NA for benign cases, so that fits here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any other lesions or findings. The most severe lesion mentioned is chronic inflammation and stromal hyperplasia, which are benign. So yes, the answer should be correct.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
