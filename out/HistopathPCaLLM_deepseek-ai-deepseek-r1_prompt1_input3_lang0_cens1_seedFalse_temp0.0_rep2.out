Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The mention of "single run" might be a bit confusing. However, the sample type isn't explicitly stated. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So I think the answer here is NA because there's no clear indication of the sample type.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The statement says, "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination... nothing conclusive may be derived." Since the examination was hindered and no malignancy is mentioned, the answer should be "no" for malignancy? Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. However, the absence of evidence isn't necessarily evidence of absence. But the text explicitly states that nothing conclusive can be derived, which means they couldn't determine malignancy. So maybe "NA" is more appropriate here because the result is inconclusive. The system might not have enough information to confirm presence or absence. So Malignancy would be NA.

For Gleason grade, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is NA (inconclusive), the Gleason should also be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because they couldn't examine the tissue properly due to burn artefacts.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the exam was inconclusive. Gleason is NA as there's no mention of grades. The example given in the problem uses NA when information isn't available or applicable, so this fits.
