Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The mention of "single run" might refer to a TURP, as TURP specimens are often collected in a single container. But the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, sometimes "single run" could be a way to describe TURP. Alternatively, if it's a large sample, maybe RP. But without clear terms like "biopsy cores", "prostatectomy", or "TURP chips", it's safer to go with NA here. The user might not have specified the exact type, so NA is appropriate.

Next, malignancy. The statement says there's some inflammation but burn artifacts prevent detailed examination. It explicitly states "nothing conclusive may be derived." So there's no mention of malignant findings, and since the examination was inconclusive, the answer here should be "no" because they didn't find any malignancy, or maybe "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report says no malignancy detected, then "no". But if it's inconclusive, maybe NA. The key here is whether the absence of conclusive results means they can't determine malignancy. The text says "nothing conclusive may be derived," so they can't confirm or deny malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, since there's no mention of any tumor or malignancy, and the exam was inconclusive, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. Since malignancy is NA here, Gleason would also be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified clearly. Malignancy is NA because results are inconclusive. Gleason is NA because no tumor was found or mentioned.
