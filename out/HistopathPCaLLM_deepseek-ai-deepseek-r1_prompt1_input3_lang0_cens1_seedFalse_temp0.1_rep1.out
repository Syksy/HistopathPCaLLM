Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The mention of "primary sample" and "prostate material" doesn't specify the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present here. So I think the sample type should be NA since it's not explicitly stated.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says there's some inflammation but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination. The conclusion is that nothing conclusive can be derived. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected and the examination was hindered, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. So Malignancy should be NA here.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. Since there's no tumor found (or inconclusive due to artefacts), the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because results are inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because no grades are reported. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion reported. So the JSON should reflect all NAs where applicable.
