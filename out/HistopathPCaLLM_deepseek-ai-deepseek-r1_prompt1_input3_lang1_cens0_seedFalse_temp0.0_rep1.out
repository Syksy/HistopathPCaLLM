Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The key word here is "lastuja", which translates to "chips" in English. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chips, so the sample type here is likely "TURP". Biopsy samples are usually small cores, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate, so "TURP" fits.

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states: "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." This translates to "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON keys are correctly spelled and the values are exactly as specified. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any Gleason scores or malignant findings. Yep, all clear. So the final answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
