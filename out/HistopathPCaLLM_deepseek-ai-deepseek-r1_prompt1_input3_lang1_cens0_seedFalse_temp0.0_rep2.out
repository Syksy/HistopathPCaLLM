Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments", which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chips. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be an entire prostate removal, which doesn't fit here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." This means "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is provided, otherwise "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and uses the exact allowed values. Let me double-check the terms and the logic. Yes, that seems right.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
