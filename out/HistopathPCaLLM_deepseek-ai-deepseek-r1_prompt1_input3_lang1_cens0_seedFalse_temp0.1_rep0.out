Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The key word here is "lastuja", which translates to "chips" in English. In medical terms, TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often results in chip-like tissue fragments. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not described as chips. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be a whole prostate removal, which isn't mentioned here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," which means "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA". I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable. Double-checking the terms to ensure I didn't mix up TURP with biopsy. Yes, TURP is correct here because of the chips description. All right, that's it.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
