Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract specific structured data into JSON format. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" in English, which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. Biopsy samples are usually small pieces, while RP (radical prostatectomy) is the entire prostate. So here, TURP seems correct.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," which means "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to ensure accuracy. Yes, "lastuja" is TURP, and the malignancy part clearly states no signs. Gleason isn't mentioned because there's no malignancy. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
