Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The term "lastuja" translates to chips, which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because TURP typically produces tissue chips. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy," which means nothing directly indicating malignancy is seen. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the terms. Yes, TURP is correct for chips. The malignancy part is clearly negative. Gleason isn't mentioned, so NA is right. No nested structures, just the three fields. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7", so this case should mirror that structure with the appropriate values.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
