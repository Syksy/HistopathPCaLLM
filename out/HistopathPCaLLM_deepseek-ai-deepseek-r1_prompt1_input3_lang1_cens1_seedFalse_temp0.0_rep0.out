Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of a prostate sample and extract specific structured data into JSON format. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan" here might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as "ajetaan" can be translated to "flushed" or "resected" in this medical context. So the sample type is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "jonkin verran tulehdusta" (some inflammation) but states that "polttoartefaktat estävät näytemateriaalin luotettavan tarkastelun" (burning artifacts prevent reliable examination). Therefore, no conclusive evidence of malignancy is found. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the artifacts make the assessment unreliable, it's not a clear "ei" (no malignancy), but rather inconclusive. However, the problem states that if there's no malignancy detected, use "ei". But the report says they can't make a conclusive decision. Wait, the instructions say for the malignancy field: "sallitut arvot 'kyllä', 'ei' tai 'NA'". So if the sample is inadequate or inconclusive, maybe "NA" is appropriate. But the example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when cancer is found, "ei" when benign, and "NA" perhaps when not mentioned. However, in this case, the report says they can't conclude due to artifacts, so maybe "NA" is correct here. But the question is phrased as "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If they can't determine because of artifacts, then the answer isn't "kyllä" or "ei", but "NA". So I think "Malignancy" should be "NA".

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of cancer (only inflammation and artifacts), the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions: "NA for benign findings".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example, when cancer is found, Gleason is reported. Here, no cancer is found (or inconclusive), so Gleason is NA. The sample type is TURP because "ajetaan" refers to TURP procedure. So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
