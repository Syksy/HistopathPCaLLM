Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The key term here is "prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The Finnish word "ajetaan" translates to "driven" or "passed," which might refer to a procedure. However, the sample types are specific. "Biopsy" is a tissue sample, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, and "TURP" is transurethral resection of the prostate. The description here doesn't clearly match any of these. The mention of "prostatamateriaalia" (prostate material) being "ajetaan" might suggest a TURP procedure, where tissue is removed in pieces. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if it's a primary sample but the method isn't specified, maybe it's a biopsy. However, the term "biopsiasta" was in the example, but here it's "primäärinäyte" (primary sample). Since the example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta," and here there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe the sample type is "NA". But wait, "primäärinäyte" could mean the primary sample type, but without specific procedure terms, it's unclear. The user might expect "TURP" if "ajetaan" refers to resection, but I'm not certain. Let me check again. "Ajetus" in medical context can sometimes refer to TURP, where tissue is evacuated. So maybe "TURP" is the correct sample type here.

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states: "nähdään jonkin verran tulehdusta, mutta polttoartefaktat estävät näytemateriaalin luotettavan tarkastelun. Siispä mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää tästä ajosta." So there's some inflammation, but due to cautery artifacts (polttoartefaktat), reliable examination isn't possible. Therefore, no conclusive findings. Since malignancy can't be confirmed or denied due to artifacts, the answer here should be "NA" because the presence of malignancy is uncertain. The report doesn't mention any malignant findings, just inflammation, but the artifacts prevent assessment. So "Malignancy" is "NA".

For Gleason score: The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "NA" (inconclusive), the Gleason should also be "NA". There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason grades here. The report says they can't make a conclusive diagnosis, so no Gleason is provided.

Putting it all together: Sampletype could be "TURP" if "ajetaan" refers to that procedure. Malignancy is "NA" because the assessment was inconclusive. Gleason is "NA" as well. Alternatively, if the sample type isn't clearly identifiable, maybe "NA" for that too. But given that "primäärinäyte" and "ajetaan" might indicate TURP, I'll go with "TURP" for sample type. Let me confirm. In some contexts, TURP specimens are referred to as "chips" or fragmented tissue, which is evacuated ("ajetaan"). So "TURP" makes sense here. So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
