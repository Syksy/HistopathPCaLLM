Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "primäärinäyte" translates to primary sample, but the key here is how the sample was obtained. The phrase "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might refer to a procedure. However, none of the standard terms (biopsy, RP, TURP) are explicitly mentioned. TURP (Transurethral resection of the prostate) involves cutting, but the description here isn't clear. Since the sample type isn't specified, I might have to go with "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text mentions "jonkin verran tulehdusta" (some inflammation) but states that cautery artifacts (polttoartefaktat) prevent reliable examination. The conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis can be made. Since there's no mention of malignancy and the examination is inconclusive, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report says they can't make a conclusive determination, does that mean malignancy isn't confirmed, so "ei"? Or is it "NA" because it's uncertain? The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy, but here it's unclear. The report says "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää", so maybe malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found, but the artifacts might be hiding it. Hmm. Alternatively, since the presence of malignancy can't be assessed reliably, maybe "NA" is more appropriate. But according to the problem statement, "Malignancy" should be "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also can't rule it out due to artifacts, perhaps "NA" is correct here. Because "ei" would imply that they checked and found no malignancy, but in this case, they couldn't assess properly. So "NA" for malignancy.

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading, and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is inconclusive, so "NA". Gleason is "NA".
