Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might refer to TURP, as TURP is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in pieces. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, "prostatamateriaalia" could be a biopsy. Wait, "primäärinäyte" just means primary sample. The key here is to look for keywords. TURP samples are usually from resection, while biopsy is needle samples. The phrase "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might translate to "transurethrally resected" which would be TURP. So Sampletype is likely "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says there's some inflammation but cautery artifacts prevent reliable examination. "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" means no conclusive findings. Since they can't reliably assess due to artifacts, but there's no mention of malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since the sample is inconclusive, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. The report doesn't mention any malignancy, just inflammation. But because the artifacts prevent reliable assessment, maybe the answer is NA? Or "ei" because no malignancy was found, but the artifacts might obscure it. The instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" – so if no conclusive result, maybe malignancy is NA. Wait, the options for malignancy are kyllä, ei, or NA. If the sample is inconclusive due to artifacts, then the presence of malignancy can't be determined, so NA.

Third, Gleason score. Since malignancy is NA (or if malignancy is ei), then Gleason would be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so regardless, it's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is NA (because inconclusive), Gleason is NA.
