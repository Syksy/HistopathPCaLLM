Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the sample mentions "shaving material" and "eight casettes". The term "shaving" might refer to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is shaved off. So, the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The statement says "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and the summary is "Benign prostate hyperplasia". Since there's no mention of malignancy and it's explicitly stated as benign, the Malignancy field should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum". However, the given text doesn't mention any Gleason grades. It's a benign case, so according to the instructions, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "no", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure there are no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered, which in this case is benign, so no Gleason applies.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
