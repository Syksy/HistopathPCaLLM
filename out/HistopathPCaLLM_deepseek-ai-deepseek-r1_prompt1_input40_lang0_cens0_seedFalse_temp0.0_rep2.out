Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The key points are to determine the sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The shaving material weighs approx 8.9g, approx 5g set on eight cassettes." The term "shaving material" might refer to TURP, as TURP often involves shaving off prostate tissue. So I'll go with TURP here.

Next, malignancy. The text says "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and the summary is "Benign prostate hyperplasia." Since there's no mention of malignancy and it's explicitly stated as benign, the answer should be "no."

For Gleason grade, the example shows that if it's benign, we put "NA." Since there's no malignancy, there wouldn't be a Gleason score reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without any nested structures. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any other sample types or malignant findings. Yep, all clear. That should be the correct structured data.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
