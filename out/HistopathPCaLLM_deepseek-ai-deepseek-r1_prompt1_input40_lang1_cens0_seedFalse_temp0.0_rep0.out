Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format based on three specific fields. The input is a Finnish medical report, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Höyläysmateriaali" translates to "shavings material", which I think refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia", which means benign prostatic hyperplasia. Also, it states "Atypiaa tai invasiivista kasvavaa epiteelia ei näy" – no atypia or invasive growth. So malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, the value should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the report is benign, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, which in this case is benign, so no Gleason.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
