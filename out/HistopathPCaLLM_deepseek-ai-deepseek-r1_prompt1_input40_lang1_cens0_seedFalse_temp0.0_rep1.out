Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläysmateriaali..." The term "höyläysmateriaali" translates to "shaving material," which isn't one of the allowed values. However, TURP is a procedure where tissue is shaved from the prostate, so maybe "höyläysmateriaali" refers to a TURP sample. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia," which means benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of malignancy, atypia, or invasive growth ("Atypiaa tai invasiivista kasvavaa epiteelia ei näy"). So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since the findings are benign, the value should be "NA". The example given shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading, so that's confirmed.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and uses the specified keys and allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
