Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläysmateriaali" translates to "shavings material" in English. TURP is a procedure where tissue is shaved off, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia" which means benign prostatic hyperplasia. There's no mention of atypia or invasive growth ("Atypiaa tai invasiivista kasvavaa epiteelia ei näy"). So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since the findings are benign, the value should be NA. The report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading, so no need to look for numbers here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the worst lesion's results are included, which in this case is benign.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
