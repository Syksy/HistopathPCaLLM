Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might indicate a biopsy, but I'm not sure. Wait, RP stands for radical prostatectomy, and TURP is transurethral resection of the prostate. The sample here is 8.9g, which is a bit small for a prostatectomy specimen. TURP specimens are usually chips, but the weight here might be possible. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention TURP or RP. The original sample type isn't clearly stated, so maybe it's NA. But sometimes in reports, the sample type is inferred. Alternatively, if it's a biopsy, they might mention cores or biopsies. The text here just says "materiaalista" and "kasetillista," which could be any type. Since it's not specified, I think Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report states "Histologinen tarkastelu paljastaa ainakin hyperplasiaa eturauhasessa ja ...... Ainakin inflammaatiota, mutta mahdollisesti jotain muutakin. Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia." Hyperplasia and inflammation are benign findings. The mention of "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else) suggests uncertainty, but no explicit malignancy is reported. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer, the Malignancy should be "ei". However, the report says "vaatii jatkotutkimuksia" (requires further investigation), which might imply suspicion but not confirmation. But according to the instructions, only confirmed malignancies are considered. So unless malignancy is explicitly stated, it's "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some suspicion, unless a Gleason score is explicitly given, it's NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, only hyperplasia and inflammation. Gleason is NA as there's no malignancy reported.
