Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might indicate a surgical specimen, but the exact type isn't clear. The original sample types are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the text doesn't specify any of these procedures explicitly, I should go with NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "hyperplasiaa" (hyperplasia) and "inflammaatiota" (inflammation), which are benign conditions. It also says "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else) and "vaatii jatkotutkimuksia" (requires further studies). However, there's no explicit mention of malignancy like adenocarcinoma or cancer. So, the answer here should be "ei" because hyperplasia and inflammation are benign, and the other possibilities are not confirmed.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be NA. Even if there were some uncertainty, without a confirmed malignancy, Gleason isn't reported.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" as no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
