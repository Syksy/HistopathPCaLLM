Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the raw data, the statement mentions "systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." The term "biopsies" here clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." That's a clear indication that there's no malignancy present. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but since there's no cancer detected, there's nothing else to consider. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, which it doesn't in the example. So putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as biopsy, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
