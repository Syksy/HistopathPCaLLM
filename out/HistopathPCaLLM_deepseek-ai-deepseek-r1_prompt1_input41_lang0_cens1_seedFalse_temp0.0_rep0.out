Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." The term "samples collected" from prostate lobes—common in biopsies. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." So there's uncertainty. The other samples mention chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, which aren't malignant. Since it's unclear, but no definitive cancer is found, maybe Malignancy is "no"? Wait, but the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The samples show inflammation and atrophy, which are benign. The uncertainty is about cancer, but since it's not confirmed, maybe Malignancy is "no". Or does "hard to determine" mean it's possible but not confirmed? The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If there's no definite mention of malignancy, then "no" might be appropriate. Alternatively, if the presence is uncertain, maybe NA. But the examples given in the problem: in the example, when adenocarcinoma is present, it's "yes". Here, since they can't determine, maybe Malignancy is "no" because there's no confirmation. Or perhaps "NA" if the information isn't available. The problem says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". The most severe here is chronic inflammation and atrophy, which are non-malignant. So Malignancy should be "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" for a malignant case. Here, since malignancy is "no", Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since samples from prostate lobes are typically biopsies)
Malignancy: no (no confirmed cancer, most severe findings are benign)
Gleason: NA (no malignancy, so no Gleason reported)
