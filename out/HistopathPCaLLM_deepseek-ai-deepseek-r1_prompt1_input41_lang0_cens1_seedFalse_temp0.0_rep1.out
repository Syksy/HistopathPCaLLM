Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." The term "samples collected" from prostate lobes—common in biopsies. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." So there's uncertainty. The other samples mention chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, which aren't malignant. Since it's unclear, but no definitive cancer is found, maybe Malignancy is "no"? Wait, but the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. If there's no mention of malignancy, and it's uncertain, maybe the answer is "no" because there's no confirmation. Alternatively, if it's uncertain, maybe NA? But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report says it's hard to determine, perhaps NA is appropriate here. But the user said to take the most severe lesion. If there's no malignant findings, then "no". But the statement doesn't confirm cancer, just that it's hard to tell. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear yes. Here, since they can't determine, maybe Malignancy is "no" because there's no positive identification. Or maybe NA? The user might consider "NA" when the information isn't present. But the statement says "hard to determine", which implies that malignancy isn't confirmed. So perhaps "no" is safer. Wait, but if the pathologist can't determine, maybe they can't rule it out. But according to the allowed values, "NA" is allowed. Let me check the example again. In the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma led to "yes". Here, since it's uncertain, maybe "NA" is better. But the user instructions say "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". The most severe here is chronic inflammation and atrophied glands, which are benign. So Malignancy should be "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" for a malignant case. Since in this case, malignancy is "no", the Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since samples from prostate lobes are typically biopsies)
Malignancy: no (because no cancer is found, only benign changes)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)
