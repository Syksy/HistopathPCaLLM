Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteet 1-6 ovat edustavia systemaattisia biopsioita..." The key word here is "biopsioita", which is Finnish for biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista." Translating that: "Prostate cancer does not appear in the material." So the answer here is "ei" (no). No malignant findings present.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason scores in the report either, which aligns with the absence of cancer.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided has a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. All conditions met. No conflicting information in the text. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
