Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by carefully reading the provided example and the instructions to make sure I understand the requirements.

First, the sample type needs to be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given example uses "biopsy" because the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text starts with "Näytteet 1-6 ovat edustavia systemaattisia biopsioita..." which translates to "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies..." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". That's straightforward for the first field.

Next, the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The example had cancer present, so it was "kyllä". In the current case, the text states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista." which means "Prostate cancer does not appear in the material." So the malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the requirement is to report it in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei" here, the Gleason field should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected. 

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported, but in this case, there are no malignant findings. The structure shouldn't have nested elements, so just the three top-level keys. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. The key phrases are "systemaattisia biopsioita" confirming biopsy, and "syöpää ei ilmene" confirming no malignancy. No mention of Gleason, so all set. The JSON should look like the example but with "ei" and "NA" for the last two fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
