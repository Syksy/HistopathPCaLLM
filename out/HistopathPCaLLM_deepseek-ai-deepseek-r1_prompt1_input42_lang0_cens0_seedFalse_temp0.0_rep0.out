Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g investigated." Prostatectomy typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be RP. That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "Summary: score 7 (4+3)." Gleason grades are used to classify the severity of prostate cancer, so the presence of Gleason scores indicates malignancy. Therefore, the answer here is yes.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The summary in the statement says "score 7 (4+3)." The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, so it should be written as "4+3=7". The mention of "small amount of Gleason 3" doesn't affect the main score since the highest grade (4) is the major component.

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example provided uses the format "4+3=7", so following that exactly. Also, check that all values are correctly mapped. No typos in the keys like Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. 

Double-checking the sample type: Prostatectomy is RP. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of Gleason. The Gleason score is clearly stated as 4+3=7. All looks good. No conflicting information in the statement. The small amount of Gleason 3 is part of the combined score but doesn't change the primary grade. So the structured data should be accurate.
