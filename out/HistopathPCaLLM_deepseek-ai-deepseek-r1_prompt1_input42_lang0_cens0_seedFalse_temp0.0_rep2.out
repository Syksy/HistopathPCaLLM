Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The goal is to create a JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g investigated." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, which is typically a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "Summary: score 7 (4+3)". Since Gleason scores are associated with cancer, the malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The summary in the text states "score 7 (4+3)", which translates to major grade 4, minor grade 3, sum 7. So the correct format here is "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions "almost exclusively seen Gleason grade 4" and a "small amount of Gleason 3", but the summary clearly states 4+3=7, which is the primary score. There's no higher grade mentioned, so this is the most severe.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. I need to format this into a JSON without any nested structures. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example to make sure everything aligns. Yep, looks good. No typos or incorrect values. The JSON should be valid as per the user's instructions.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
