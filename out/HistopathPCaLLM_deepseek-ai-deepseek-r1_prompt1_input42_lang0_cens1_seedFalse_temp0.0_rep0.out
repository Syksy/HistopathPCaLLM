Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "prostate sample" is mentioned, but there's no specific indication of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The mention of weight might suggest a surgical specimen, but without explicit terms, I can't be sure. So, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The statement says, "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." Since it's uncertain whether it's cancer (malignant) or inflammation (benign), the malignancy field should be "no" because there's no confirmation of cancer. Wait, but the allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". If it's uncertain, maybe "NA" is more appropriate? Hmm, the user instructions say "Malignancy" is "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the report states that they can't determine if it's cancer or not, it's not confirmed as malignant. So "no" might not be right. Alternatively, if the presence of malignancy is uncertain, perhaps "NA" is better. But the example given in the instructions uses "yes" when cancer is detected, "no" otherwise. Since the text says they can't determine, maybe "no" isn't accurate. Wait, the example had a clear malignancy. Here, the uncertainty might mean that malignancy isn't confirmed, so "no" could be correct. Or maybe "NA" is better because the presence is uncertain. The user's instructions for Malignancy: "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, perhaps "NA" is the right choice. Let me check the example again. The example statement clearly states adenocarcinoma, so "yes". In the current case, since it's uncertain, "NA" might be the answer. But the user says "NA" is allowed. So, in this case, since it's not determined, the answer should be "NA".

Third, the Gleason grade. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. The example uses "4+3=7" when it's present. Here, since there's no mention of Gleason, and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA", Malignancy is "NA", Gleason is "NA". But wait, the user said to return results from the most severe lesion. However, the text doesn't mention any lesions, just mixed findings where they can't determine cancer or inflammation. So there's no severe lesion reported. Therefore, all fields would be "NA".
