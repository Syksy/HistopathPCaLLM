Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The mention of "prostate sample" is a bit vague. The word "prepared" might indicate a surgical specimen, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The "weighing app 8" part is unclear—maybe a typo or abbreviation? Since there's no explicit type mentioned, I think the safest answer here is NA for Sampletype.

Next, determining malignancy. The statement says, "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." So the presence of a malignant tumor isn't confirmed. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the text states uncertainty between cancer and inflammation, it's not a clear yes or no. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". However, the text here doesn't mention any Gleason grades. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no mention of Gleason scoring, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have NA for all three fields because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is undetermined, and there's no Gleason grade reported.

 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
