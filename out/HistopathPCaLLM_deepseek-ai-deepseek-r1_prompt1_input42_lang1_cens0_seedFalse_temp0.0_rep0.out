Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan n. 80g." The term "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. In the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The report talks about Gleason grades 4 and 3. Gleason grading is used specifically for prostate adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Since Gleason scores are mentioned, that indicates the presence of malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text states "Yhteenveto: pistesumma 7 (4+3)." The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, the major pattern is 4 and minor is 3, summing to 7. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are direct and fit the allowed options. No other details in the text suggest any other sample types or benign findings. Everything seems to check out.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
