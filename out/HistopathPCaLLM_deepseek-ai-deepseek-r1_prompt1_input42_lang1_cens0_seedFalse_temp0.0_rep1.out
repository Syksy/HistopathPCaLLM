Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaattia". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the sample is a prostatectomy specimen, RP is the correct choice here.

Next, determining malignancy. The report talks about Gleason grades 4 and 3. Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer, which is malignant. So, the presence of these grades indicates malignancy. The answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text states "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". The required format is "major+minor=sum". The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, so it should be "4+3=7". 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the format with the sum, so following that exactly. Also, checking that all values are correctly mapped to the allowed options. No issues there. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "RP", Malignancy as "kyllä", and Gleason as "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
