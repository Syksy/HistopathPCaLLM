Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text is "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan n. 80g." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. In medical terms, RP stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "Gleason 4 asteen erilaistumista" and "Gleason 3". Gleason grades 3 and 4 are both indicative of cancer, with 4 being more aggressive. Since there are malignant findings, the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, so it's 4+3=7. That's straightforward.

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses "4+3=7" correctly. The sample type is correctly identified as RP. Malignancy is confirmed. All fields are filled appropriately without any nesting. So the JSON should look like the example but with these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
