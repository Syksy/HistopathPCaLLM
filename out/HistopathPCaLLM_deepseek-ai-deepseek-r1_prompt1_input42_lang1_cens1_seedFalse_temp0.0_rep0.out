Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?". The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. Now, the allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy or surgery, just refers to a prostate sample. So maybe Sampletype is NA here. But wait, sometimes "prostatanäyte" could be a biopsy if not specified otherwise. However, since it's not clear, perhaps NA is safer.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Sekalaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta. Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota." So there are findings, but they can't determine if it's cancer (syöpää) or inflammation. Since malignancy can't be confirmed, the answer here should be "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant. Wait, no. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The report says they can't determine if it's cancer or inflammation. So it's uncertain. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't determine, maybe the answer is NA. But the instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If they can't confirm malignancy, then maybe "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed. Hmm, tricky. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. Here, since it's uncertain, perhaps the malignancy is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Or maybe NA? The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. If the report states that malignancy can't be determined, maybe NA is appropriate. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If they can't determine, then the answer isn't yes or no, so NA. So Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason. Since there's no mention of Gleason scores and malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since it's just "prostatanäyte" without specifying biopsy, RP, or TURP), Malignancy is NA (because it's uncertain), and Gleason is NA.
