Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The original text mentions "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?". The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. Now, the possible values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy or surgery, just refers to a prostate sample. Since it's not clear, maybe I should go with NA here. But wait, sometimes "näyte" can be a biopsy if not specified otherwise. Hmm, but the instructions say to use the allowed values. Since it's not explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe NA is safer.

Next, Malignancy. The text says "Sekalaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta. Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota." So there are some findings, but they can't determine if it's cancer (syöpää) or inflammation. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's uncertain, the malignancy isn't confirmed. The question is, does "ei" mean no malignancy, or is NA more appropriate here? The report says they can't determine, so it's not confirmed as malignant. But the presence of findings might be ambiguous. However, the instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since they can't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "ei" (no) or NA? Wait, the options are "kyllä" if there are malignant findings, "ei" if not, or NA if unknown. Here, they can't determine, so maybe NA. But the user's example had a case where malignancy was present. In this case, since it's uncertain, maybe NA is better. Wait, the third question's answer is NA if benign. But here, the malignancy isn't confirmed. The possible values for Malignancy are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states that they can't determine whether it's cancer or inflammation, the correct answer here would be "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Or does "ei" mean that there are definitely no malignant findings? The text says they can't tell, so maybe NA is more appropriate. But the allowed values don't have an "ei varmuudella" (no with certainty), so perhaps "ei" is when it's confirmed benign, and NA when uncertain. Wait, the example given in the instructions: if the sample is benign, Gleason is NA. So in the example, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. In this case, since they can't determine malignancy, maybe Malignancy should be NA. But the options are only "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if the report says they can't determine, then Malignancy is NA. Because "kyllä" is yes, "ei" is no, and NA is when it's not determined. So in this case, since it's uncertain, Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, and Gleason is only reported for malignant cases, this should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the type isn't specified), Malignancy is NA (because it's uncertain), and Gleason is NA.
