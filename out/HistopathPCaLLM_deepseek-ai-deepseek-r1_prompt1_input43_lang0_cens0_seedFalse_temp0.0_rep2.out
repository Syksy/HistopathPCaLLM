Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with specific fields. First, I need to identify the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the raw data: "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." The term "prostate chippings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because that procedure often results in chippings. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, determining malignancy. The text says "Only ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." Since there's an explicit mention of no adenocarcinoma, Malignancy is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. So putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype: TURP, Malignancy: no, Gleason: NA. I need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but here there's no lesion, so straightforward. Check if all values are correctly allowed. Yes, TURP is allowed, and "no" for malignancy. Looks good.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
