Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." The sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The terms like "prostate samples" and "cassettes" might be part of a biopsy or a surgical specimen. However, without specific terms like "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," it's safer to put NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So it's not confirming malignancy, nor is it definitively ruling it out. The correct value here would be NA because the report is inconclusive.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy is NA here, the Gleason should also be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason scores in the statement, which reinforces that decision.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. Let me double-check the original text again to confirm there's no mention of sample type specifics or any tumor findings. Yep, looks like all three fields should be NA.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
