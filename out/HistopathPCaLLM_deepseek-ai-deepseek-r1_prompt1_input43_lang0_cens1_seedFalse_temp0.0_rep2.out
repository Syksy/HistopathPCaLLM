Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." The sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The terms like "prostate samples" and "material placed in cassettes" are generic. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So it's not confirming malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the report states that they can't determine cancerous changes, it's not a clear "yes" or "no". However, the instructions say to return "NA" only if the information isn't available. Wait, the statement says "no decision... can be reached," which implies that malignancy isn't confirmed. But the allowed values for Malignancy are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report explicitly states that no cancerous changes are found, it's "no", but here it's uncertain. The phrase "no decision... can be reached" suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed, so maybe "no"? Or is it "NA" because the determination wasn't made? The example given in the instructions had a clear "yes" when cancer was detected. Here, since they can't reach a decision, perhaps "NA" is appropriate. But I need to be careful. The user's instructions say "NA" for benign statements in the Gleason field, but for Malignancy, "NA" is allowed. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't explicitly say it's absent, maybe "no" isn't correct. Wait, the statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So they can't determine if there's malignancy. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" for Malignancy.

Third, the Gleason grade. The example shows that if there's a malignant finding, the Gleason is in the format "major+minor=sum". If benign, it's "NA". Since the malignancy is "NA" here (as per previous step), the Gleason should be "NA" as well. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores because they didn't find cancer.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA" because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "NA" because the report couldn't determine cancerous changes. Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy reported. So the JSON should be:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no mention of any lesions, just ordinary tissue and atrophied glands without cancerous changes, the most severe is non-malignant. But since the Malignancy field is "NA", that's correct. Also, check if the sample type can be inferred. The weight is 30g, which might suggest a TURP or RP, but without explicit terms like "TURP" or "radical prostatectomy", it's safer to put "NA". So the final answer should be as above.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
