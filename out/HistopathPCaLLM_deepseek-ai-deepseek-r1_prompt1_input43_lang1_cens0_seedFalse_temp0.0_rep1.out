Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja. Materiaali ajettiin kaseteissa A-H, purkissa jäljellä noin 15g." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically obtained from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Yksittäisiä atrofiouituneita rauhasia näkyy, mutta mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin." This translates to there being some atrophic glands but no signs of adenocarcinoma. Since no malignancy is found, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the worst lesion's results are included. The example provided uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7" when cancer is present, but here it's absent. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because the material is prostate chips, which are from a TURP procedure, not a biopsy or RP (radical prostatectomy). 

Malignancy is clearly "ei" because the report explicitly states no signs of adenocarcinoma. 

Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy. 

Everything seems to fit the required structure. No issues here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
