Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja. Materiaali ajettiin kaseteissa A-H, purkissa jäljellä noin 15g." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is typical for a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "Yksittäisiä atrofiouituneita rauhasia näkyy, mutta mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin." This translates to no signs of adenocarcinoma, so malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. So Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". In this case, since there's no cancer, Gleason is NA. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because the material is chips, which is from TURP. Biopsy would be cores, RP is the whole prostate. 

Malignancy is clearly stated as not present. 

Gleason only applies if malignancy is present, so NA here. 

Everything seems to fit the required structure.
