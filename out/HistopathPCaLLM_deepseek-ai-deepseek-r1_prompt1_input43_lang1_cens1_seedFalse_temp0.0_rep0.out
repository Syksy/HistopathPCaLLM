Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The key word here is "prostatanäytteitä," which translates to prostate samples. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the text doesn't specify the exact procedure but refers to samples taken, I might lean towards "biopsy" as the sample type. However, I need to be careful. Sometimes TURP samples are also mentioned as being chips or larger resections. But the term "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) is common in biopsies. Alternatively, if it's a surgical specimen like RP or TURP, they might mention more about the procedure. Since it's not clear, maybe "biopsy" is the safest assumption here. Wait, but the weight is 30g, which is quite a lot for a biopsy. Biopsies are usually small. RP specimens are the entire prostate, which can weigh around 30-40g. TURP specimens are usually smaller, but can vary. Hmm, this is conflicting. The text says "prostatanäytteitä" (prostate samples) and 30g. If it's 30 grams, that's more indicative of a surgical specimen like RP or TURP. But the user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Let me check the Finnish terms. "Prostatanäytteitä" could be either biopsies or parts of a larger resection. However, TURP is a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed, and the weight can be around that. RP is the whole prostate. But the text doesn't mention anything about surgery type. Since the sample is 30g, which is typical for a prostatectomy (RP), but the term "näytteitä" (samples) might suggest multiple samples, which could be TURP. However, without explicit mention of the procedure, maybe the safest answer is NA. But the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't specify the procedure, just "prostatanäytteitä". So perhaps the sample type is NA because it's not explicitly stated. But the user might expect us to infer from context. Alternatively, maybe "TURP" if 30g is typical for that. I'm a bit unsure here. Let me think again. In the example, the sample type was "biopsy" because the text said "biopsiasta". Here, there's no such indication. So maybe the correct answer is NA. But the user might expect that "prostatanäytteitä" implies biopsy. However, in clinical context, when they take biopsies, they usually take multiple small cores, which wouldn't weigh 30g. So 30g is more likely a surgical specimen. But since the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA, and the text doesn't specify, maybe NA is the right choice here. Alternatively, if "näytteitä" refers to TURP chips, then TURP. But I'm not certain. Let's flag this and come back after checking the other parts.

Next, malignancy. The text says "ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Translating: "no conclusions can be drawn regarding cancer-related changes." So there's no evidence of malignancy, but it's not a definitive "ei" (no) because it's stated that they can't make conclusions. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The phrase here is that they can't conclude there are cancer-related changes, which might mean that malignancy isn't identified, but it's not a clear negative. However, in the context of pathology reports, if they don't find malignancy, they usually state it as "no malignancy detected" or similar. Here, the statement is more like "no conclusions can be made about cancer-related changes," which might imply that there's some uncertainty. But according to the user's instructions, the options are straightforward: yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't clearly state that there is none, maybe "ei" (no) is appropriate. Alternatively, if the findings are inconclusive, perhaps "NA". But the user's example had a clear malignancy, so in this case, since they can't make conclusions about cancer-related changes, maybe the malignancy is "ei" because no definitive signs are found. Or is it "NA" because it's inconclusive? The user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report says they can't draw conclusions, does that mean there's no evidence of malignancy, hence "ei"? Or is it that the presence is uncertain, hence "NA"? I think in medical reporting, if they can't confirm malignancy, the default is to consider it as not present. So "ei" would be correct here. But I'm not 100% sure. Let's proceed with "ei" for malignancy.

Third, Gleason score. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or adenocarcinoma. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. So that's straightforward.

Now, going back to the sample type. The text starts with "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The weight is 30g. A typical prostate weighs about 20-30 grams, so 30g could be the entire prostate (RP) or a TURP specimen. However, the term "näytteitä" (samples) might suggest multiple samples, which could be TURP chips. But RP is the whole prostate. If it's RP, the sample type would be "RP". If it's TURP, then "TURP". But the text doesn't specify the procedure. However, in some cases, the weight can hint. A TURP specimen's weight can vary, but 30g is on the higher side. An RP specimen is the whole prostate, so 30g is plausible. But without explicit mention, should we choose NA? The user's example used "biopsy" when the text said "biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention the procedure. So perhaps the correct answer is NA. Alternatively, if "prostatanäytteitä" refers to TURP, but I'm not sure. In Finnish medical terms, "prostatanäytteitä" could be any type of sample. Since the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA, and the text doesn't specify, the safest answer is NA. But maybe the weight and context imply TURP. For example, TURP specimens are often described as chips or fragments, and the weight can be substantial. RP is the whole prostate. If the weight is about the size of a whole prostate, maybe RP. But I'm not certain. Since the example used "biopsy" when the procedure was mentioned, here it's not mentioned. So perhaps the sample type is NA. Alternatively, maybe the term "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) is a standard processing step for any specimen, so that doesn't help. Given the uncertainty, the correct answer might be NA for sample type.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (no malignant findings)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)
