Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The key word here is "prostatanäytteitä," which translates to prostate samples. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the text doesn't specify the exact procedure but refers to samples taken, I might lean towards "biopsy" as the sample type. However, I need to be careful. Sometimes TURP samples are also mentioned as being chips or larger resections. But the term "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) is common in biopsies. Alternatively, if it's a surgical specimen like RP or TURP, they might mention more about the procedure. Since it's not clear, maybe "biopsy" is the safest assumption here. Wait, but the weight is 30g, which is quite a lot for a biopsy. Biopsies are usually small. RP specimens are the entire prostate, which can weigh around 30-40g. TURP specimens are usually smaller, but can vary. Hmm, this is conflicting. The text says "prostatanäytteitä" (prostate samples) and 30g. If it's 30 grams, that's more indicative of a surgical specimen like RP or TURP. But the user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Let me check the Finnish terms. "Prostatanäytteitä" could be either biopsies or parts of a larger resection. However, TURP is a procedure where parts of the prostate are removed, and the weight can be around that. RP is the whole prostate. But the text doesn't mention anything about surgery type. Since the sample is 30g, which is typical for a prostatectomy (RP), but the term "näytteitä" (samples) might suggest multiple samples, which could be TURP. However, without explicit mention of the procedure, maybe the safest answer is NA. But the example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta," which is explicit. Here, the text doesn't specify the procedure, just "prostatanäytteitä." So maybe the sample type is NA. Wait, but the user instructions say to choose from the allowed values. If the text doesn't specify, should it be NA? Let me think. The original example had "biopsy" because the text said "biopsiasta." Here, there's no such specification, just "prostatanäytteitä." So perhaps Sampletype is NA. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe "TURP" is possible if the weight is 30g, but I'm not certain. The problem states that if it's not clear, use NA. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text says "ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Which translates to "no conclusions can be drawn about cancer-related changes." However, the previous part mentions "Yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia nähtävillä" (individual atrophic glands visible), but no signs of malignancy. The key here is whether there are malignant findings. The text states that there are no changes related to cancer, so malignancy should be "ei" (no). The allowed values are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since the report explicitly says no cancer-related changes, the answer is "ei."

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, otherwise "NA." Since malignancy is "ei," Gleason is "NA."

Putting it all together: Sampletype could be NA because the procedure isn't specified, but wait, the text mentions "prostatanäytteitä" and the weight. If the weight is 30g, that's more like a surgical specimen. But without knowing if it's RP or TURP, maybe NA is safer. Alternatively, in some contexts, "prostatanäytteitä" might refer to biopsy samples, but 30g is too much. So perhaps the sample type is NA. Alternatively, maybe the user expects "biopsy" here, but I'm not sure. Let me check the example again. The example had "biopsy" when the text said "biopsiasta." Here, the text doesn't mention the procedure, so maybe NA is correct. So the final answer would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified, just "prostatanäytteitä" which could be any type, but the weight might suggest RP or TURP, but without explicit mention, it's safer to go with NA)
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA
