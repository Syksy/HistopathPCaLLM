Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these one by one based on the provided text.

First, the sample type. The original text starts with "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The key word here is "prostatanäytteitä," which translates to prostate samples. The user mentioned possible values: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term used here is pretty generic, just "prostate samples." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. So I might have to go with NA here since the sample type isn't clearly specified as one of the allowed options.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia nähtävillä, ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Translating that, it mentions seeing some atrophic glands but no conclusions can be drawn about cancer-related changes. The key part here is "ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään," which means they can't conclude there's cancer. Since there's no mention of malignant findings, and they specifically state that cancer-related changes aren't concluded, the malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Lastly, Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grading. Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. The allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" for malignancies, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer was found. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested structures and only includes the worst lesion's results, which in this case, there are none. So the final answer should reflect these three points accurately.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
