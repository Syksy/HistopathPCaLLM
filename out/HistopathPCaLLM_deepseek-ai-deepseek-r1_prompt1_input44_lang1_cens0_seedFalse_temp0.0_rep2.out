Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

The sample is described as "Edustavia prostatabiopsiota normaalimallin mukaan." The word "prostatabiopsiota" translates to prostate biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy". That's the first field done.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "Ei mitään epäilyttävää" which means nothing suspicious was found. Also, it states "AIemmissa biopsioissa kyllä löydetty prostatasyöpää, mutta nyt ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta." So previous biopsies had cancer, but now there's no tumor tissue seen. Therefore, malignancy here is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example also shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". 

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. But in this case, there's no malignancy, so no Gleason. All fields should be straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "prostatabiopsiota" is biopsy, "ei mitään epäilyttävää" and no tumor tissue now. All seems correct.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
