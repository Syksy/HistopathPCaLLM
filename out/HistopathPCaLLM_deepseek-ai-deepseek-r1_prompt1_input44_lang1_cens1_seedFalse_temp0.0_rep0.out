Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytteitä" translates to prostate samples. The note at the end says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää," which mentions previous biopsies, but the current sample is described as standard routine. However, the main sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The initial part doesn't specify the procedure type, so maybe it's a routine sample, but since the options don't include "routine", perhaps it's "NA". But wait, the note refers to previous biopsies, but the current sample's type isn't clear. The first sentence doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP, so maybe Sampletype is "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Maligneihin muutoksien liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." So, no malignant changes can be concluded. The previous biopsies had cancer, but the current sample doesn't show malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy here, the Gleason value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear from the current report, so "NA". Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".
