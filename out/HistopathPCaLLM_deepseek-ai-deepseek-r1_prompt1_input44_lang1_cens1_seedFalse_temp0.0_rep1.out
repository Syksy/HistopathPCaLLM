Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The Finnish word "näytteitä" translates to samples, and "standardirutiinin mukaisesti" suggests a routine procedure. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". However, in the current case, the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. It just says "standard routine" samples. But there's a note at the end: "Huom: Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää." This note refers to previous biopsies, but the current sample isn't clearly stated as a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the Sampletype here is NA because the current report doesn't specify the type. Wait, but the main part says "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä" which could mean representative samples, but without specifying the method. So perhaps the Sampletype is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text states "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." So they can't determine any malignant changes. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the current sample doesn't show malignancy, but there's a note about previous biopsies with cancer. However, the question is about the current sample. The current sample's malignancy is negative, so "ei". But wait, the note says previous biopsies had cancer, but the current sample doesn't. So the answer for Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score. Since the current sample doesn't show malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". Even though previous biopsies had cancer, the current report doesn't mention any Gleason grading because they didn't find malignant changes here. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the procedure isn't specified beyond "standard routine"), Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".
