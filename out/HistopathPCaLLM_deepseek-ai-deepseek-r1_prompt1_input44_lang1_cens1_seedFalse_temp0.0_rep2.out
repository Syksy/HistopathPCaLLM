Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The key word here is "näytteitä," which translates to samples. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta." However, the current report doesn't explicitly state the sample type as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The phrase "standardirutiinin mukaisesti" suggests routine samples, which might be biopsies, but it's not definitive. The note at the end says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää," referring to previous biopsies, but the current sample isn't clearly stated. So, maybe the sample type here is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." That translates to "Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." So, the current sample doesn't show malignancy. However, the note mentions previous biopsies had cancer. But the question is about the current sample. Since they can't determine any malignant changes here, the answer might be "ei" (no). Wait, but the note says previous biopsies had cancer. Does that affect the current sample's malignancy? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion in the current sample. The current report doesn't find malignancy, so "ei" would be correct.

Third, Gleason score. Since the current sample doesn't show malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even though previous biopsies had cancer, the current sample's result is benign, so Gleason isn't applicable here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly stated, so NA. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant changes found. Gleason is NA. Let me cross-check the example. In the example, even though previous biopsies might have had cancer, the current sample's findings determine the answer. So yes, here malignancy is "ei" and Gleason NA. Sampletype is unclear, so NA.
