Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the sample type. The original statement mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate." I know that RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, malignancy. The report talks about a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "perineural invasion seen." Both of these are indicators of malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The text says "classes 3+4" in the focus. The user prefers the format "major+minor=sum." So that would be "3+4=7." Even though there's a mention of "tissue gleason 3" later, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The 3+4=7 is the higher grade compared to just 3, so that's the one to report.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. Let me double-check each field again. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All allowed values are respected. No other parts of the text contradict this. Seminal vesicles are clean, margins negative, but those don't affect the three fields needed. The key points are the sample type, presence of tumor, and the highest Gleason score. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
