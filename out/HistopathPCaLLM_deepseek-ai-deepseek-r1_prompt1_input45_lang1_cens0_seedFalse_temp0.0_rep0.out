Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti (paino 70g), prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The key term here is "prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. According to the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor focus, and "Gleason luokat 3+4". Since Gleason grading is mentioned, that indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "luokat 3+4". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, the major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, but wait, typically Gleason scoring is major (higher grade) + minor. Wait, in the example given, the user had "4+3=7". So the higher grade is listed first. But in the current text, it's written as 3+4. That would sum to 7 as well. However, I need to check if the text specifies which is major and minor. The text here says "luokat 3+4", which in Gleason scoring usually means primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. But according to current standards, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, but in the example, the user's example had 4+3=7, which is correct as the higher grade is first. However, in the given text here, it's written as 3+4. That might be a mistake in the text, or perhaps the user intended it that way. But according to the instructions, we should report it as written. The text says "luokat 3+4", so the major is 3 and minor is 4? Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (most prevalent) and the secondary pattern (next most prevalent). However, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the sum where the primary is the higher grade. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me think again. The original Gleason score is the sum of the most common (primary) and the next most common (secondary) patterns. However, if the secondary is higher than the primary, the primary is still the most prevalent. But in practice, when reporting, sometimes the higher grade is listed first. But the user's example shows that "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7. So in the example, even if the order in the text is 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4". So according to the example, we should take the order as written. Wait, but in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which is converted to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is 4 and 3, but the sum is written as 4+3. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", so the sum would be 3+4=7. But according to the user's example, the order in the text is preserved. So in this case, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". However, I need to check if the text mentions which is major and minor. The text here says "luokat 3+4", which might be the primary and secondary. But according to current standards, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, but the user's example didn't follow that. The example took the order as written. So perhaps the instruction is to take the order as written in the text. So in this case, the text says 3+4, so the Gleason would be "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example had "4 ja 3" leading to "4+3=7". So the order in the text is preserved. Therefore, in this case, the text says "3+4", so the Gleason is "3+4=7". However, I need to confirm if the sum is correct. 3+4 is 7, yes. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but there's another part in the text: "kudoksen gleason 3". That's mentioned in the context of perineural invasion: "Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3." So does that affect the Gleason score? Hmm. The main tumor focus is in E, F, G with Gleason 3+4. Then, in the perineural invasion, it's Gleason 3. But according to the instructions, we should take the worst (pahimman) lesion. So the main tumor is 3+4=7, which is worse than Gleason 3. So the Gleason to report is 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostatectomy specimen)
Malignancy: kyllä (because there's a tumor focus with Gleason)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The other mention of Gleason 3 in perineural invasion is not the worst, so it's ignored. Also, the margins and lymph nodes are negative, but that doesn't affect malignancy here. The sample type is definitely RP. The answer should be in the specified JSON format.
