Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti". The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. According to the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, which is the same as a prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The report talks about "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor focus. Also, there's mention of Gleason grades 3+4. Since Gleason grading is used for cancerous tissue, this confirms malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the text says "luokat 3+4". The correct format is "major+minor=sum". Here, major is 4 and minor is 3, sum is 7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the user specified that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. The report mentions "suurin osa rauhasista erillisia, mutta osa rakentaa yhteneviä rauhaskanavia (luokat 3+4)". The Gleason 3+4 here is part of the tumor focus. Since 4 is the major component, that's the higher grade. So the correct Gleason is 4+3=7. Also, there's a mention of "kudoksen gleason 3" elsewhere, but that's probably a separate area. The worst is 3+4=7, but wait, the major component is the first number. So if it's 3+4, the sum is 7, but the major is 3. Wait, no, in Gleason scoring, the first number is the primary grade (most prevalent), and the second is the secondary (next most prevalent). However, when combining, the higher grade is considered if there are different areas. Wait, but in the example given in the problem, "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7, which is correct. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3 and secondary 4, sum 7. But according to current guidelines, the higher grade is listed first if there's a tertiary pattern, but here it's written as 3+4. So the correct format is "3+4=7". Wait, but the example in the problem had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So maybe the order depends on how it's written. The text here says "luokat 3+4", so the primary is 3, secondary 4. But in the example, the order was 4 and 3, leading to 4+3. So the user's example indicates that the order in the text is followed. Therefore, in this case, since it's written as 3+4, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which was converted to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. However, in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3, secondary 4. But according to Gleason scoring, the primary is the most prevalent pattern. However, in some cases, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might be considered. But the user's instructions say to take the reported Gleason as given. So if the text says 3+4, then it's 3+4=7. But wait, the example in the problem had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is the same sum but different order. So the key is to follow exactly how the text reports it. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", so the answer should be "3+4=7". However, I need to check if there's a higher grade elsewhere. The text also mentions "kudoksen gleason 3" in the perineural invasion part. But that's probably a separate area. The main tumor focus is 3+4, which is the worst. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. Wait, but in the example, the order was 4+3, which is a higher grade (sum 7, but with primary 4). So maybe the user's example is different. Wait, perhaps the user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which translates to grades 4 and 3, so the primary is 4, secondary 3. Hence, 4+3=7. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3, secondary 4, sum 7. But according to current medical practice, the higher grade is listed first if there are multiple patterns, but the user's example seems to follow the order mentioned in the text. Therefore, in this case, the answer should be "3+4=7". However, I need to confirm. Let me check the text again: "Fokuksessa suurin osa rauhasista erillisia, mutta osa rakentaa yhteneviä rauhaskanavia (luokat 3+4)." So the majority are separate glands (Gleason 3), but some form fused glands (Gleason 4). So the primary pattern is 3 (most prevalent), secondary 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. So the correct entry is "3+4=7".
