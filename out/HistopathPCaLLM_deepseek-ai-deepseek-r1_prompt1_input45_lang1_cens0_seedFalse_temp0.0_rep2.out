Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti (paino 70g), prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The key term here is "prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. According to the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor focus, and "Gleason luokat 3+4". Since Gleason grading is mentioned, that indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "luokat 3+4". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, the major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, but wait, typically Gleason scoring is major (higher grade) + minor. Wait, in the example given, the user had "4+3=7". So the higher grade is listed first. But in the current text, it's written as 3+4. That would sum to 7 as well. However, I need to check if the text specifies which is major and minor. The text here says "luokat 3+4", which in Gleason scoring usually means primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns. But according to current standards, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, but in the example, the user's example had 4+3=7, which is correct as the higher grade is first. However, in the given text here, it's written as 3+4. That might be a mistake in the text, or perhaps the user intended it that way. But according to the instructions, we should report it as written. The text says "luokat 3+4", so the major is 3 and minor is 4? Wait, no. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (most prevalent) and the secondary pattern (next most prevalent). However, the current grading system (since 2016) uses the highest pattern as the primary. Wait, but the text here is from a report, and the way it's written is "3+4", which would mean primary 3 and secondary 4, summing to 7. But according to the user's example, they used the major (higher) first. However, the user's example had "4 ja 3" in the text, leading to 4+3=7. In the current case, the text says "3+4", so we should take it as written. So the Gleason would be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had the text "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which was converted to "4+3=7". So the order in the text is 4 and 3, but the sum is 7. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", so the sum is 3+4=7, but the major is 3 and minor 4. However, according to current medical standards, the Gleason score is reported as the higher grade first. But the user's instructions say to take the pahimman (worst) lesion's results. So perhaps the highest Gleason in the sample. Wait, the text mentions "suurin osa rauhasista erillisia, mutta osa rakentaa yhteneviä rauhaskanavia (luokat 3+4)". So the main part is 3+4. But also, there's "kudoksen gleason 3" mentioned in "Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3." So there's another area with Gleason 3. But the user instructions say to take the worst (pahimman) lesion. So the highest Gleason is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but in the example, the user had "4+3=7" even though the text said "4 ja 3". So the order in the example was 4+3. But in the current case, the text says "3+4". So should the order be preserved as written, or should the higher grade come first? According to the user's example, they preserved the order as written. So if the text says "3+4", then the answer is "3+4=7". But according to medical standards, the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next. However, the user's instructions don't mention adjusting the order based on medical standards, just to report as per the text. So in this case, the text says "3+4", so the answer is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostatectomy specimen)
Malignancy: kyllä (because there's a tumor focus and Gleason score)
Gleason: "3+4=7"

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The other mention of Gleason 3 in perineural invasion is a separate area but the worst is 3+4=7. So that's the one to report.
