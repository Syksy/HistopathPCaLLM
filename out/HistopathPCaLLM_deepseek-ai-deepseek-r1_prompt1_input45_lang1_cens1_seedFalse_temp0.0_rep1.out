Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text starts with "Suspekti prostatanäyte, prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The word "näyte" means sample, and "prostatanäyte" is prostate sample. But there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. The term "suspekti" means suspected, but that doesn't indicate the procedure type. So I don't have enough info here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Negatiiviset marginaalit, kapseli ehjä. Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa." So negative margins, intact capsule, no metastases in lymph nodes. However, the main part talks about a focus in the sample (E, F, G areas) with glands and ducts separated. The structure is unclear and difficult to interpret, requiring further examination. There's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The report is suspicious but not conclusive. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here would be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignant finding reported. Wait, but "suspekti" might imply suspicion. However, the instructions say to report only confirmed malignancy. Since it's unclear and requires further study, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed. So "ei" or "NA"? The options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but it's suspicious, maybe "ei" because there's no explicit malignant finding. Alternatively, if the sample is suspekti but not confirmed, maybe NA. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. Here, the report is uncertain. The user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no clear malignancy, then "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades either. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Let me check again. The sample is a "prostatanäyte" but the type isn't specified. The report is inconclusive, no clear malignancy, so malignancy is "ei". Gleason isn't mentioned, so NA. That seems right.
