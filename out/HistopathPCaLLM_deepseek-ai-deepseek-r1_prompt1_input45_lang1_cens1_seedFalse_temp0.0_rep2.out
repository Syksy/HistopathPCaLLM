Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text starts with "Suspekti prostatanäyte, prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report mentions "näytemateriaali" (sample material) from areas E, F, G, which sounds like biopsy samples taken from different regions. There's no mention of surgery like RP or TURP, so I think the sample type here is biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Negatiiviset marginaalit, kapseli ehjä. Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa." Negative margins and no metastases in lymph nodes. However, the main part mentions "rakenne epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen" (structure unclear and difficult to interpret). The key here is whether there's a mention of malignancy. The report doesn't explicitly state adenocarcinoma or cancer. It mentions a suspicious sample with unclear structure requiring further examination. Since there's no definitive malignant finding, but it's suspicious, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's uncertain and requires more analysis, perhaps the malignancy is "ei" (no) or maybe "NA". Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" (Were there malignant findings in the sample?). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspicion, then the answer should be "ei" (no) because there's no explicit mention of cancer. Alternatively, if it's unclear, maybe "NA". But according to the example, if there's no clear malignancy, it's "ei". Let me check the example again. In the example, when adenocarcinoma is mentioned, malignancy is "kyllä". Here, since it's "suspekti" but not confirmed, and no malignancy is found, maybe "ei". The report says "Ei metastaaseja" but that's about metastases. The main sample's analysis is unclear. So perhaps the malignancy is "ei" because no definitive cancer is found. But the sample is suspicious. Hmm. The user's instruction says to answer based on whether there were malignant findings. If the report doesn't state any, then "ei". So Malignancy: "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The Gleason is only reported if there's malignancy. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which supports this.

So the final JSON would be:
Sampletype: biopsy
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
