Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA.

Looking at the raw data: "Shaved prostate chippings with total tissue weight around 20 gr." The term "shaved prostate chippings" is a bit tricky. I recall that TURP procedures often result in chippings or fragments, as they remove tissue in pieces. Biopsy samples are usually cores or needle samples, and RP is the entire prostate. So here, TURP seems likely. The sample type would be TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So the answer here is "no" for malignancy. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. 

Now, structuring the JSON. The example given uses "biopsy", "yes", and "4+3=7". In this case, the sample type is TURP, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no cancer, the most severe is non-existent, so all fields should reflect that. 

Double-checking the sample type. Shaved chippings are typical for TURP. Biopsy would be more like needle cores. RP is the whole prostate. So TURP is correct. Malignancy is clearly stated as no. Gleason grade only applies if there's malignancy, so NA. 

Everything seems to fit. The JSON should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
