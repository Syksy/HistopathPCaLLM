Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate material total size around 2x. Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run." The term "prostate material" is a bit vague. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. I'll have to go with NA for that.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report says, "Regular prostate tissue with glands... Some glands seen, findings which might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia. Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." Since they can't determine if there's cancer, it's not confirmed as malignant. So Malignancy should be "no" because there's no positive identification, but wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. Wait, the user instructions say "NA" if the information isn't available. But here, the report states they can't assess, so maybe Malignancy should be "no"? Or is it "NA" because it's uncertain? Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear "adenocarcinoma detected" leading to "yes". Here, since it's uncertain, maybe "no" isn't correct. Wait, the options are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report says they can't assess, does that mean the presence of malignancy isn't determined, so it's NA? Or is "no" because no malignancy was found? The statement says "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." So the presence is uncertain. Therefore, the answer here should be "NA" because it's not confirmed either way.

Third, the Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason is only reported for malignant cases, this should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported. Let me check the example again. In the example, when adenocarcinoma was present, they provided the Gleason. Here, since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is NA. That makes sense. So the final JSON should have all three fields as NA.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
