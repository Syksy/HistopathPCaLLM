Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostate material total size around 2x. Material was set on cassettes..." The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly mentioned here. The report mentions "prostate material" and setting on cassettes, which is common in biopsies, but it's not definitive. However, since there's no mention of RP or TURP, and the context is about examining prostate tissue, maybe it's a biopsy. But the user might prefer NA if it's unclear. Wait, the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy". Here, the text says "prostate material" but doesn't specify the procedure. So maybe NA is safer here.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states: "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The example had "yes" when cancer was detected. Here, since they can't assess, the answer should be NA. The user instructions say to take the most severe lesion, but if it's inconclusive, then NA.

Gleason grade. The example used "4+3=7" when cancer was present. Here, since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because they couldn't assess for cancer. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no cancer found or assessed.
