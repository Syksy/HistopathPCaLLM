Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaalin..." which translates to shaved prostate chips. I remember that TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which involves removing tissue chips. So the Sampletype here should be "TURP". Biopsy would be if it's a needle biopsy, and RP is radical prostatectomy. So definitely TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." That means no prostate cancer was found. So Malignancy should be "ei". The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since there's a clear negative, it's "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The Gleason is only reported if there's cancer. The example given shows that when malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise NA.

Let me double-check. The sample type is TURP because it's chips from resection. Malignancy is negative. Gleason is NA. No mention of any Gleason grading because there's no cancer. All right, that seems to fit the requirements. No nested structures, just the three fields with the specified allowed values.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
