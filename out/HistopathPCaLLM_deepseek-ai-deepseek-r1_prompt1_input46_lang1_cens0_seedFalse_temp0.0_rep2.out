Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaalin..." which translates to shaved prostate chips. I remember that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves removing chips of tissue. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." That means no prostate cancer was found. So malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if there's no cancer, Gleason is NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there's no cancer detected.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer was found. Gleason is NA. No nested structures, just the three fields. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
