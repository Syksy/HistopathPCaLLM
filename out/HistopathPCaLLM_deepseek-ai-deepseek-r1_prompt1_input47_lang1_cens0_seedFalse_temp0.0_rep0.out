Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kolme biopsiapalaa" which translates to three biopsy pieces. So the sample type should be "biopsy". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Here, biopsy is clearly indicated.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella." That means no malignant findings on either side. So the malignancy field should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. But in this case, there are no malignancies, so Gleason is NA. The example provided in the problem shows that when malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason is filled, otherwise NA. 

Double-checking the text: no mention of adenocarcinoma or any Gleason scores. The part about "kokonaispituus 3+4=7 cm" refers to the total length of the biopsies, not Gleason. So that's irrelevant here.

All right, putting it all together. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. The JSON structure should follow the example given, using the specified keys and allowed values.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
