Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "kolme biopsiapalaa" which translates to "three biopsy pieces." So the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The text states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella," meaning no malignant findings on either side. So the answer here should be "ei."

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there are no malignant findings mentioned, the Gleason field should be NA. The text does mention "kokonaispituus on noin 3+4=7 cm," but that's referring to the total length of the biopsies, not Gleason scores. So that's a red herring. The key is that there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading here because malignancy is absent.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, with the right keys and string values. No nested structures, just a flat JSON object. Let me double-check the example provided to ensure consistency. The example uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7" when there was malignancy. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Everything seems to align. No mistakes here.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
