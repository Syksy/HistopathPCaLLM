Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkitaan näytemateriaalia oikealta ja vasemmalta. Eturauhasmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on noin 30+40=70." The mention of "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) from left and right sides, and the total amount being 30+40=70, which is typical for a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure where chips are collected and measured in grams. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states: "Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla." This translates to "It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right." Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain, the correct value here is "NA".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy couldn't be determined (hence, no confirmed malignancy), the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "NA", and Gleason as "NA". I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, which in this case, since malignancy isn't confirmed, all relevant fields default to NA where applicable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
