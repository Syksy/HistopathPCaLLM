Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "prostate resection" and later refers to "resection" in the summary. Resection typically refers to RP or TURP. Since TURP is usually for removing prostate tissue in benign conditions or smaller volumes, but here there's a tumor with Gleason 9, which is more likely to be an RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma" and mentions a Gleason score, which is indicative of malignancy. So the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The report says in the first focus, most common Gleason 4, next 3 (so 4+3=7). The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) and some 4. But the summary states "Gleason 9". Wait, how does that add up? Gleason grades are based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the highest grade is 5, then even if there's a small portion of 4, the primary would be 5 and secondary 4, making 5+4=9. The summary confirms Gleason 9. So the correct format is "5+4=9".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The summary mentions Gleason 9, which is the highest, so that's the one to report. The structured JSON should have Sampletype as "RP", Malignancy "yes", and Gleason "5+4=9".

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
