Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the raw data provided, the statement starts with "Examining prostate resection..." The term "resection" here is key. Since TURP is a type of resection, but RP is a more extensive surgical procedure. However, the report mentions "prostate resection" and also refers to seminal vesicles, which are typically removed in a radical prostatectomy. But the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the sample is a biopsy. The term "resection" in the report might indicate RP, but I need to be careful. Wait, the example for TURP would be if it's a transurethral resection. However, the presence of seminal vesicles being sampled (cassettes I & J) suggests that the entire prostate was removed, which is more in line with a radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype here is likely "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report clearly states "Histologically found adenocarcinoma..." which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two tumor foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 and 3, which would be 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small portion of 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Wait, how does that add up? If the second focus is 5+4=9, that's the highest. The summary says Gleason 9, so the most severe is the second focus. The user wants the Gleason in the format "major+minor=sum". So the second focus is 5+4=9. But the report says "Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4." So the major component is 5, minor is 4. So 5+4=9. The summary confirms this. Therefore, the Gleason should be "5+4=9".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 5+4=9. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should be valid with those keys and string values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
