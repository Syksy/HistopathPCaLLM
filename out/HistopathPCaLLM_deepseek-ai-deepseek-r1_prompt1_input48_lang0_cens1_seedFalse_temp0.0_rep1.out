Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." Autopsy samples aren't listed in the allowed values. So Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "Some exemplifying histological changes are seen" but also mentions "Seminal vesicles are all clean." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The summary part says it's for educational purposes and not used for differentiation scores like Gleason. So Malignancy would be "no" since there's no clear indication of malignancy.

For Gleason grade, the summary explicitly states that they're not deriving differentiation scores (Gleason 1-5). Since there's no Gleason reported and the sample isn't malignant, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's from autopsies, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA.
