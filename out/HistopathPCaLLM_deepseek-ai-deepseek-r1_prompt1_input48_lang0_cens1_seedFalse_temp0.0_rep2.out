Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the sample is from "multiple autopsies." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be "NA."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns," but it doesn't explicitly state the presence of a malignant tumor. The summary also says it's not used to derive differentiation scores like Gleason. So Malignancy would be "no" since there's no clear indication of malignancy, or maybe "NA." But since the example uses "no" for benign cases, I think "no" is appropriate here.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The summary explicitly mentions that Gleason scores 1-5 aren't derived due to the demonstration's nature. So there's no reported Gleason grade here. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's from autopsies, Malignancy is no as there's no mention of cancer, and Gleason is NA since it's not provided.

 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
