Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided example and the given text.

First, the Sampletype. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the text starts with "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti". The term "resekaatti" in Finnish translates to "resection" in English. Now, I need to recall what RP and TURP stand for. RP is radical prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the entire prostate. TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which is a different type of surgery where part of the prostate is removed through the urethra. However, "prostataresekaatti" likely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type here would be "RP". But I need to be careful. Wait, "resekaatti" is resection, but in the context of prostate, a resection could be TURP or RP. However, the weight mentioned is 100g. A normal prostate is about 20-30 grams, so 100g is quite large. Radical prostatectomy specimens are usually the entire prostate, which in cases of cancer can be larger, but TURP specimens are usually smaller pieces. However, TURP is typically for benign enlargement, but cancer can be found incidentally. However, the presence of "seminaalivesikkelit" (seminal vesicles) being examined (kaseteilla I & J) suggests that this is a radical prostatectomy, as TURP doesn't remove seminal vesicles. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text clearly states "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The example had "4+3=7". The given text mentions two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 as the most common (major) and 3 as the next (minor), so 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) and a small part 4. Since Gleason grading takes the most predominant pattern as the primary and the next most common as secondary, but if there's a tertiary pattern (higher grade), sometimes it's considered. However, the summary at the end says "YHTEENVETO: Resekaatissa löydettiin siis Gleason 9 kasvain." So the total Gleason score is 9. But how is that calculated? Gleason score is the sum of the primary and secondary patterns. If the second focus has primary 5 and secondary 4, that's 5+4=9. Since the summary states Gleason 9, that's the highest (worst) lesion. So the Gleason should be "5+4=9". But wait, in the text, the first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5 with some 4. So the second focus's primary is 5, secondary is 4, leading to 5+4=9. The summary confirms that. Therefore, the worst lesion is Gleason 5+4=9. So the correct entry is "5+4=9".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostate resection specimen, likely radical prostatectomy given the examination of seminal vesicles and the structure of the report).

Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present).

Gleason: 5+4=9 (as per the summary and the worst focus).
