Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" which translates to "material obtained from autopsy". Autopsy isn't one of the allowed values, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" (some exemplary histological changes) and mentions that they are used for demonstration purposes. There's no mention of malignancy like adenocarcinoma or cancer. The summary also states that these findings aren't used to determine differentiation grades, which suggests they aren't malignant. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, the example in the instructions uses Gleason 1-5 but in a context where it's not applied. The text explicitly says they don't use these to determine differentiation grades, and Gleason is mentioned as an example (esim. Gleason 1-5), not as a reported result. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's from an autopsy, Malignancy is "ei" as no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report.
