Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "useasta ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia". Ruumiinavaus means autopsy, but the allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Autopsy isn't listed, so I think the answer here is NA. The sample isn't one of the specified types.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Joitakin kiinnostavia löydöksiä" but clarifies that these are for demonstration and not used to determine differentiation grades like Gleason. There's no mention of malignancy directly. However, since they mention Gleason in the context of not using it, maybe there's some suspicion but not confirmed. But the allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since it's not explicitly stated as malignant, maybe "ei" or NA. Wait, the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, they have some findings but not confirmed as malignant. The summary says they don't use them to determine grades, so maybe malignancy is "ei" or NA. Hmm. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If there's no clear malignancy, maybe "ei" or NA. But the example used "kyllä" when cancer was present. Here, since they can't determine differentiation (Gleason 1-5), maybe it's benign. So malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The summary says they don't use the findings to determine differentiation grades, like Gleason. So Gleason is NA here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since it's autopsy, not biopsy, RP, TURP). Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy confirmed. Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example, when cancer was present, Gleason was filled. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but the user said to take the worst lesion. If there are some findings but not confirmed as malignant, maybe malignancy is "kyllä"? Wait, the text says "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" which are example-like changes for teaching. They mention not using them to determine differentiation (Gleason). So maybe these are not malignant, just benign changes. Hence, malignancy is "ei". That makes sense. So the answer is as above.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
