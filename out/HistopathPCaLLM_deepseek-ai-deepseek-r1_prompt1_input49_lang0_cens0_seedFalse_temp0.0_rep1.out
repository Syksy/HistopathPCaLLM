Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is chipped away. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says, "Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma." Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states, "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." So the major is 4 (since the most common is the primary pattern) and minor is 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the most common is the primary grade, so if the most common is 3, that's the primary, and the second most is 4, which is the secondary. So the Gleason sum would be 3+4=7. But the example in the problem shows that when the text says "grades 4 and 3", the output is "4+3=7". Wait, in the example, the order in the text is 4 and 3, but the sum is 4+3=7. So the primary is the first mentioned, even if it's higher? Wait, no. Wait, Gleason grading is based on the primary (most predominant) and secondary (second most predominant) patterns. So if the most common is 3, that's primary, and the second is 4, that's secondary. So the correct Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But in the example given, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", which is written as 4+3=7. So the order in the text might not always reflect the actual primary and secondary. Wait, but in the example, the user's correct output is 4+3=7. So perhaps the way the text is written, if it says "grades 4 and 3", they take the first as major and the second as minor. But in reality, the primary is the most predominant. So in the current case, the text says "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the example shows that when the text lists them as "4 and 3", it's 4+3. So perhaps the order in the text is not the determining factor, but the actual primary and secondary as stated. Here, the text explicitly states the most common (primary) is 3, and the second most (secondary) is 4. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Now, putting it all together. Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the statement mentions carcinoma in 5 shavings and the Gleason is provided, that's the most severe. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to verify that all the values are allowed. Sampletype "TURP" is allowed. Malignancy "yes" is allowed. Gleason in the format "major+minor=sum" as "3+4=7" is correct. No nested structures here. So this should be the correct structured data.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
