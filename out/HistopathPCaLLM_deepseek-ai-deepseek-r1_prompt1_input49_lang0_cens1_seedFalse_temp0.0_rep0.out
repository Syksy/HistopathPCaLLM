Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possible due to the technical limitations." The term "glasses" here likely refers to glass slides, which are typically used in biopsies. So the sample type might be biopsy. But the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. Hmm, maybe it's safer to put NA here since it's not clearly stated.

Next, malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "some changes that warrant further investigation" but doesn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer or adenocarcinoma, and it's stated that further assessment isn't possible, the malignancy field should be NA. It's not confirmed as yes or no.

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text here doesn't mention any Gleason grades. The changes are noted but not specified. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because no grades are provided. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the text doesn't present any severe confirmed lesion, all fields remain NA.
