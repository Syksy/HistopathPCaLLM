Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses." The term "glasses" here might be a translation or typo, possibly meaning "slides" as in glass slides used in pathology. However, the sample types allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" but doesn't specify the procedure type. So, the sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says the fifth glass has changes needing further investigation, but due to technical limitations, they can't assess further. There's no mention of a confirmed malignant tumor. The presence of changes might suggest suspicion, but without confirmation, we can't say "yes". Since it's uncertain, Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have "NA" for all fields. I need to ensure no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that format.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
