Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" and "höyläyslastuista" translates to "chips" or "shavings," which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Biopsy samples are usually called "biopsia" in Finnish, and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would refer to the entire prostate being removed. Since the sample here is from TURP, the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report states "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." The usual approach is to take the most common (major) and the next most common (minor) grades. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 3+4=7. But wait, the example given in the instructions had 4+3=7. The order matters here. The major pattern is the higher grade if there are multiple patterns, but according to the current Gleason grading system, the primary grade is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if the highest grade is present, even if less extensive, it might be considered. Wait, no, the current system (Grade Groups) uses the most common and the highest grade if there's a tertiary. But the user's example uses the major (most common) and minor (next most common). The text here says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 3+4=7. But in the example, the order was 4+3=7. However, the user's instructions say to report "major+minor=sum" where major is the higher grade. Wait, no, the example given in the problem shows "4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So in that case, even though the order in the text is 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3. But in the current case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So according to the example's logic, the major is the first number (most common?), but in the example, the first mentioned was 4 and 3, leading to 4+3. Wait, maybe the example is not about the most common but the primary and secondary patterns. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if a higher grade is present, even if less extensive, it might be considered. But according to the 2014 ISUP guidelines, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, regardless of grade. Wait, no, actually, the primary is the most common grade, and the secondary is the second most common. But if there's a higher grade that is less common, it's considered tertiary. However, in the case where the most common is 3 and the next is 4, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But in the example given by the user, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which is 4+3=7. So the order in the text is 4 and 3, but the sum is 4+3. So perhaps the user's system is that the first mentioned is the major, the second is minor, regardless of which is higher. But in the current case, the text says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 3+4=7. But the example had the higher grade first. However, the user's instructions say "major+minor=sum" where major and minor are the two most common, but the example seems to take the first mentioned as major. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", and the sum is 4+3=7. So in that case, the first number is the major, the second is minor. But in the current case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So according to that, the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 3+4=7. But the problem is that in the example, the order in the text is 4 and 3, leading to 4+3. So perhaps the system here is that the first mentioned is the major, regardless of which is more common. Wait, but the current text says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the most common is 3, next is 4. Therefore, the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 3+4=7. But in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which might be the order of the grades, not the frequency. So perhaps in the example, the major is 4 and minor is 3, even if 3 is more common? That would be conflicting. Wait, maybe the example is just a way of writing, and the actual rule is to take the most common as major, next as minor. So in the current case, the answer should be 3+4=7. But the user's example has 4+3=7, which would be if the major is 4 and minor is 3. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe the user expects that the higher grade is listed first. Wait, in modern Gleason scoring, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if a higher grade is present, even if less common, it's considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive (i.e., most common) grade, and the secondary is the second most extensive. If there's a tertiary grade (third most common), it's only noted in certain cases. So in the current case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So Gleason score is 3+4=7. But in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which would be primary 4 and secondary 3, sum 4+3=7. So perhaps the example is based on the order mentioned in the text, not the frequency. But that contradicts the actual medical practice. However, the user's example might be indicating that the order in the text is taken as major and minor. So if the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", then it's 4+3. But in the current case, the text says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So the most common is 3, next is 4. Therefore, according to the example's logic, the sum would be 3+4=7. But the example's text didn't mention "tavallisin" but just listed the grades. So perhaps the user's system is that the first mentioned grade is the major, the second is minor, regardless of frequency. But in the current case, the text explicitly states the most common and next most common. So the correct sum would be 3+4=7. However, in the example, the order in the text was 4 and 3, leading to 4+3. So maybe the user's model expects that the first number in the text is the major, even if the text states that the most common is different. But in the current case, the text explicitly states the most common is 3, next is 4. So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But I need to check the user's instructions again. The user says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So major and minor, which are the two most common patterns. So major is the most common, minor is the next. Therefore, in this case, major is 3, minor is 4, sum 3+4=7. But the example had 4+3=7, which would be if major is 4 and minor is 3. So why is that? Because in the example's text, the order was 4 and 3. But perhaps in that case, the most common was 4, and the next was 3. But the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which might not explicitly state which is more common. So the user's example might be taking the first mentioned as major. But in the current case, the text explicitly states the most common and next. So the answer should be 3+4=7. However, I need to make sure. Let me think again. The user's example: "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So the text lists 4 and 3, and the sum is 4+3. But in reality, if 4 is the primary (most common) and 3 is secondary, that's correct. But if the text had said "tavallisin on 3, seuraavaksi 4", then sum would be 3+4. So in the current case, the text does state that the most common is 3, next is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

But wait, in some cases, even if a higher grade is less common, it might be considered. For example, if the most common is 3, but there's a smaller component of 5, the Gleason score would be 3+5=8. But in this case, the next most common is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (höyläyslastuista = TURP chips).

Malignancy is "kyllä" because carcinoma was found.

Gleason is "3+4=7".
