Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The input text mentions "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" and "höyläyslastuista" translates to "chips" from a procedure. In medical terms, TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often produces such chips. So the sample type here should be "TURP". The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So Sampletype is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says that in 5 out of the samples, carcinoma was found ("5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma"). Since carcinoma is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next most common is 4. The standard format is major + minor = sum. So the major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, making the sum 7. However, wait, usually the higher grade is the major. If the most common is 3 and the next is 4, does that mean the major is 4 or 3? Wait, no. Gleason scoring takes the two most prevalent patterns, with the higher grade listed first. But the text says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. But according to Gleason grading rules, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if the secondary is a higher grade, then the score is secondary + primary. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the sum of the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (second most prevalent) grades. However, if there's a tertiary (third) higher grade, that might affect the score in some cases, but here it's only two mentioned. So in this case, primary is 3, secondary is 4, so the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the problem is that the user example had 4+3=7, which is different. So the order matters based on which is primary. The example given in the problem statement was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So in that case, the major was 4 and minor 3. But in the current case, the most common is 3, next is 4. So the major is 3, minor 4, leading to 3+4=7. However, according to current Gleason grading guidelines, if the two grades are different, the higher grade is listed first if it's the most prevalent. Wait, no. The primary grade is the most prevalent, regardless of its value. So if the most prevalent is 3 and the next is 4, then it's 3+4=7. But in some cases, if the highest grade is present even in a smaller amount, but that's for tertiary. Wait, I need to confirm. 

Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the sum of the most common (primary) and the second most common (secondary) patterns. The order is primary then secondary, regardless of their individual grades. So if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, the score is 3+4=7. If the primary is 4 and secondary is 3, it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7, but the order can affect the prognosis. However, the user's example had 4+3=7, which was correct. In the current case, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the problem is that the user's instructions say to report the "pahimman leesion" (worst lesion) results. So perhaps in this case, even if the most common is 3, but there's a higher grade present (4), maybe the major is the highest grade present, not the most common? Wait, no. The standard approach is that the primary is the most extensive pattern, even if a higher grade is present but less extensive. However, in some cases, if there's a small amount of higher grade, it might be considered tertiary. But according to the text here, the most common is 3, next is 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But I need to check if the user's example and the instructions have any specific rules. The example given was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So in that case, the first number is the major (4) and the second minor (3). So the order in the text is followed. In the current case, the text says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4". So the order is 3 first, then 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, in clinical practice, sometimes the higher grade is listed first if it's present, even if it's less extensive. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next. So if the most extensive is 3, and the next is 4, then it's 3+4=7. However, in some cases, if there are multiple cores or samples, the highest Gleason from any core is taken. But the user's instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). So perhaps in this case, even if the most common is 3, but there's a lesion with 4, the worst lesion's Gleason would be 4+3=7? Wait, no. The worst lesion would be the one with the highest Gleason score. If in a single lesion, the primary is 4 and secondary 3, that's 4+3=7. If another lesion has 3+4=7, but the worst is the same. But the text here says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4". This suggests that across all samples, the most common grade is 3, and the next is 4. But the worst lesion would be the one with the highest grades. Wait, but the user's instruction says to report the worst lesion's results. So perhaps in this case, the worst lesion has the highest Gleason, which would be 4+3=7 or 3+4=7? Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, the text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma. Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So in the 5 chips with carcinoma, the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next is 4. So for each of those 5 chips, perhaps the primary is 3 and secondary 4, leading to 3+4=7. Or maybe in some chips, the primary is 3 and others 4. But the way it's phrased, "tavallisin" (most common) and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) might refer to the overall grades present. For example, across all the samples, grade 3 is the most frequently observed, and grade 4 is the next. But how does that translate to the Gleason score? The Gleason score for a case is typically the highest Gleason score found in any of the samples. So if any of the 5 chips had a Gleason score of 4+3=7, then that would be the worst. Alternatively, if the worst is 3+4=7, but that's the same sum. However, the order matters for prognosis. But the user's example used the order given in the text. In the example, the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so the answer was 4+3=7. Here, the text says "tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4". So the order is 3 first, then 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But I need to make sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the "tavallisin" refers to the primary pattern, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" the secondary. So if the most common (primary) is 3, and the next (secondary) is 4, then the Gleason is 3+4=7. That's the correct approach. So the answer should be "3+4=7". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (höyläyslastuista).

Malignancy is "kyllä" because carcinoma was found.

Gleason is "3+4=7".
