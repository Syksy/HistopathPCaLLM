Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" and "höyläyslastuista" translates to "chips" in the context of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here should be TURP. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since TURP is explicitly mentioned through "höyläyslastuista", that's the answer for the first field.

Next, malignancy. The text states that in 5 out of the samples, carcinoma was found ("5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma"). Carcinoma is malignant, so the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

Then, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to report the worst (pahin) lesion's result. The text mentions the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next most common is 4. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) and secondary (minor) patterns are added. Here, the major would be 3 and minor 4, but wait—no, actually, the highest grade should be considered. Wait, the standard approach is to take the most predominant grade as the primary and the next most predominant (but lower) as the secondary. However, if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less common, it might be considered. But the example given in the problem shows that when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", it's 4+3=7. So the order in the text matters. Here, the text says "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So the most common (tavallisin) is 3, next (seuraavaksi yleisin) is 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4? But that would be 3+4=7. However, in the example, the order in the text was 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. So perhaps the order in the text determines primary and secondary. Here, the primary is 3, secondary is 4. But wait, in Gleason grading, the primary is the most predominant pattern, and the secondary is the second most predominant. However, if a higher grade is present, even in a smaller amount, it might be considered. But according to the current guidelines, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, regardless of the grade. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) pattern and the secondary (next most extensive) pattern. However, if there's a tertiary pattern of higher grade, that might be considered in some scoring systems, but the problem statement here says to take the pahimman leesion tulokset (worst lesion's results). So perhaps in this case, even though the most common is 3, if there's a 4 present, the worst would be 4. But the text says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem had 4+3=7. So the order in the text is important. In the example, the text listed 4 and 3, leading to 4+3. Here, the text lists 3 first (most common) and 4 second (next most common). So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But wait, the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (results of the worst lesion). So if there's a lesion with a higher grade, even if it's not the most common, should that be taken? For example, if the worst lesion has primary 4 and secondary 3, but overall the most common is 3. But the text here says that the most common is 3, next is 4. So the worst lesion's Gleason would be 3+4=7. But I need to check the exact wording. The text says "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So the two most common grades are 3 and 4. Therefore, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". 

Wait, but in the example, the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which was translated to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. In the current case, the order is 3 first, then 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason here is "3+4=7".
