Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input text is: 

"Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla. Näistä viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia. Juuri nyt löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia."

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatanäytteistä" which translates to "prostate samples". The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term used here is "näytteistä" (samples), but it doesn't specify the exact type. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta". Here, since it's just "prostatanäytteistä" without specifying the procedure, I might have to go with NA. But wait, maybe "prostatanäytteistä" is a general term. Let me check the example again. In the example, "Prostata biopsiasta" led to "biopsy". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified, hence "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text says there are some changes ("muutoksia") needing further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since they can't assess the findings right now, it's unclear if it's malignant. The presence of changes might suggest suspicion, but without confirmation, we can't say "kyllä". The correct answer here is "NA" because the malignancy isn't confirmed or denied; it's inconclusive.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no Gleason data, this should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is filled, otherwise NA. Here, malignancy isn't confirmed, so Gleason remains NA.
