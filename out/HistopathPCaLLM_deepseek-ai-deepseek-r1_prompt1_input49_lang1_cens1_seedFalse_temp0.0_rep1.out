Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The word "prostatanäytteistä" translates to prostate samples. The options allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term "lasilla" refers to glass slides, which is common in biopsies. So the sample type here is likely biopsy.

Next, malignancy. The text states that in the fifth slide, there are some changes needing further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. The key here is that they can't confirm malignancy right now. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since the findings are uncertain and require more tests, the malignancy field should be NA because it's not confirmed as either present or absent.

Lastly, Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. The only findings are indeterminate changes needing more tests. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or specific Gleason components, the Gleason field should be NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA due to lack of information.
