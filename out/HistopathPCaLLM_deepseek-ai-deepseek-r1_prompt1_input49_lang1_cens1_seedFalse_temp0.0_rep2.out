Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input text is: 

"Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla. Näistä viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia. Juuri nyt löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia."

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatanäytteistä" which translates to prostate samples. The term "8:lla lasilla" refers to 8 slides. The sample type could be biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the text doesn't specify the exact procedure but refers to slides of prostate samples, it's a bit ambiguous. However, biopsies are commonly examined on slides. But without explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe the safest answer here is "NA" because the report doesn't clearly state the sample type.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia" (some changes requiring further investigation) and that evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since the changes are noted but not confirmed as malignant, and the assessment can't be done, the answer isn't clearly "kyllä" (yes) or "ei" (no). The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report states that evaluation isn't possible, "NA" might be appropriate here.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or specific grades (like 3+4=7), and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the exact type isn't specified)
Malignancy: NA (because the findings are inconclusive and require further tests, and evaluation isn't possible)
Gleason: NA (no Gleason reported)

  "Sampletype": "NA",
