Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample part" and "sampled tissue". The term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated, but the mention of sampling sites and samples not containing prostate tissue suggests that this is a biopsy procedure. However, the report also says one sample part isn't representative as it has no prostate tissue, but the rest is representative. Since the sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe I should go with NA here. Wait, but the example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "prostate biopsy". In the current case, the text doesn't specify the exact sample type. So perhaps Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present" but also mentions the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So the report isn't confirming malignancy, but it's also not ruling it out due to insufficient material. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the sample is insufficient to assess, it's not a clear yes or no. So Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the report doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma detected, and the sample is insufficient, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades. The example given had explicit terms, but here the data is missing or inconclusive, so NA is appropriate for all three fields.
