Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista" which translates to prostate biopsies from specific sites. So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." This means no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since there's no malignancy detected, the answer here should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. In this case, since all samples are benign except sample 3, which is non-representative, but the conclusion is that no carcinoma is found. So the malignancy is "ei" and Gleason is "NA".

Double-checking the sample type: the text mentions "prostatabiopsiat", so "biopsy" is correct. Malignancy is negative, so "ei". Gleason isn't applicable here, hence "NA". Everything seems to fit the required structure.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
