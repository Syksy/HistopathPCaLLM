Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The key word here is "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". Even though sample 3 wasn't representative, the overall sample type is still biopsy.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." This means no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. So malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7" when there's cancer. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "ei löydetä karsinoomaa" confirms no cancer. Sample type is clearly biopsy. All samples except 3 are benign, but sample 3 isn't representative. However, the overall conclusion is no malignancy. So the JSON should reflect biopsy, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
