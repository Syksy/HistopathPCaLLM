Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "prostatabiopsiat" which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type here should be "biopsy". Even though sample 3 isn't representative, the others are biopsies, so the main type is biopsy.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that no carcinoma or PIN changes were found ("ei löydetä karsinoomaa"). So malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. All samples are biopsies, so Sampletype is biopsy. No issues with the other samples as they're benign. So the final JSON should reflect these points.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
