Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The user wants three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The key word here is "prostatabiopsiat," which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The text states, "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. All samples are benign. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the instruction says to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no malignancy here, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example given has all three fields at the top level. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings, so nothing to worry about there.

Double-checking the sample type: definitely biopsy. Malignancy is a clear "no". Gleason is NA. All seems correct. No typos in the JSON keys. Let's put it all together.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
