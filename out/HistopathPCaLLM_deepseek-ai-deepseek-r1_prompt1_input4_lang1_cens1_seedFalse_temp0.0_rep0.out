Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The word "näyttöönottokohtia" refers to sample collection sites. The term "biopsiasta" was in the example, but here it's talking about multiple sample sites. The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the text doesn't specify RP or TURP, and it's about taking samples from standard locations, it's likely a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text says that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions that no atypical structures were found. However, the key point is whether malignant findings are present. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to insufficient material, but there's no positive identification either. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but also doesn't state it's absent definitively, maybe "ei" (no) isn't right. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. The text says the sample isn't enough to assess, so maybe the answer is "ei" because they didn't find any, but the uncertainty might lead to "NA". Wait, the options are: if there are malignant findings, "kyllä"; if not, "ei"; if not determined, "NA". Since the sample is insufficient to assess, the presence can't be confirmed, so malignancy status is uncertain. Therefore, "NA" might be appropriate here. But the original text says "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida", which means they can't reliably assess. So the answer for malignancy should be "NA" because it's not determined.

Third, Gleason score. Since the malignancy is "NA" or "ei", the Gleason would be "NA". But wait, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". If malignancy is "kyllä", then we need the Gleason. In this case, since malignancy is "NA" (because they can't assess), then Gleason is "NA". Alternatively, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". But the text doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma, so maybe malignancy is "ei". Wait, the text says "mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole havaitussa prostatasolukossa", which means no atypical structures found. But the sample is insufficient to assess presence. So maybe the malignancy is "ei" because no atypical structures were found, but the sample is inadequate. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The key is whether malignant findings are present. If the report states that no atypical structures were found, but the sample is insufficient, does that mean "ei" (no malignancy) or "NA" (couldn't assess)? The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. Here, since they didn't find any atypical structures but the sample is inadequate, perhaps the answer is "ei" for malignancy. But the report says they can't reliably assess due to insufficient material. So maybe the correct answer is "NA" for malignancy because the assessment isn't reliable. Therefore, malignancy is "NA", and Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example, even though the sample was a biopsy and malignancy was present, they provided Gleason. Here, since malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to make sure that the sample type is correctly identified. The text mentions "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" which refers to processed tissue as samples. The method of collection isn't explicitly RP or TURP, so biopsy is the default. Yes, that's correct.

  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
