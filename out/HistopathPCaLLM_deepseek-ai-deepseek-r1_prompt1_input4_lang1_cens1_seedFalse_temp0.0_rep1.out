Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Prostata biopsiasta..." in the example translates to "biopsy". In the current case, the text mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The key word here is "näyttöönottokohtia" which refers to sampling sites. The term "biopsiasta" in the example was the clue for biopsy. Here, since it's about taking samples from standard locations and mentions "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" (tissue processed as samples), it's likely a biopsy. But wait, the example used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta". The current text doesn't explicitly say "biopsia", but refers to multiple sampling sites. However, TURP and RP are specific procedures. Since the text doesn't mention surgery like prostatectomy or TURP, and it's about taking samples, the sample type is probably biopsy. But maybe I should check if there's any other hint. The text says "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" which is "tissue processed as samples", which aligns with biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy: whether there are malignant findings. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The example had adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was yes. In the current case, the text states "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So the material isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Since they can't confirm or deny, does that mean malignancy is "ei" (no) because they didn't find any, or "NA" because it's uncertain? The key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample is inadequate, but no malignancy is found, but they can't rule it out, how to categorize. The report says that no atypical structures are observed ("mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole"), but the sample isn't enough to assess. So the malignancy isn't confirmed. However, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there any malignant findings. Since they couldn't find any, and the sample is inadequate, but no malignancy is detected, maybe the answer is "ei". But the system might require "NA" if the assessment is inconclusive. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is insufficient, but no malignancy is found, but they can't exclude it, perhaps the answer is "ei" because the report doesn't indicate any malignancy found. However, the text says "ei ole riittävä... arvioida" which means they can't assess. So maybe the answer is "NA" because the presence can't be determined. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample is inadequate, but in the examined material there's no malignancy, then "ei". But the report says that in the observed prostate tissue, there are no atypical structures, but the sample isn't enough to evaluate. So the malignancy is not present in the sample, but the sample is not representative. Hmm. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If no malignancy is found, even if the sample is inadequate, then "ei". But if the sample is inadequate, maybe it's "NA". Wait, the example had a clear malignancy. In this case, the report says that in the observed tissue, there are no atypical structures, but the sample isn't sufficient to assess. So the answer for malignancy would be "ei" because no malignancy was found, but the sample is inadequate. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they didn't find any, even if the sample is inadequate, the answer is "ei". But maybe "NA" because the assessment is inconclusive. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original Finnish text again: "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So the material is insufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. But in the examined material, "mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole havaitussa prostatasolukossa" – no atypical structures in the observed prostate tissue. So the sample is inadequate, but in the part they looked at, there's no malignancy. So the malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings were present, even though the sample might not be sufficient to rule it out entirely. Therefore, "Malignancy" would be "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was some mention, but in this case, there's no mention of Gleason scores because no cancer was found. So "Gleason": "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA.
