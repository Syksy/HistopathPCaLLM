Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The term "näyttöönottokohtia" refers to sampling sites, which suggests that this is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also states that no atypical structures were found. However, since the sample isn't representative in one area but otherwise seems normal, there's no clear evidence of malignancy. But the key point here is that they couldn't confirm malignancy due to insufficient material. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. The report says they can't reliably assess, so it's not confirmed. But the absence of findings doesn't mean "ei" (no), because they couldn't assess. So maybe "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the text says "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida" which means the sample isn't enough to evaluate. So since there's no mention of malignancy being present, but the sample is inadequate, should Malignancy be "ei" or "NA"? The instructions say "hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille" would have Gleason as NA, but here the malignancy isn't confirmed. Since the sample is inadequate, maybe the malignancy is "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't find any malignancy but can't rule it out due to insufficient sample, should it be "ei" (since no malignancy was detected) or "NA" (because assessment wasn't possible)? The text says "ei havaita normaalia prostatasolukkoa" in one sample, but others are representative. However, the key part is "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So they can't reliably assess the presence of malignancy. Therefore, since malignancy isn't confirmed, but the sample is inadequate, the answer might be "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the text doesn't explicitly say malignancy was found. Alternatively, since the assessment is inconclusive, maybe Malignancy is "NA". But according to the example, if there's a malignancy, Gleason is provided. Here, since there's no mention of malignancy, and the sample is inadequate, maybe Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was detected in the samples they could assess. But the note says "muutoin näytteinä käsitelty kudos vaikuttaa edustavalta prostatalta" and "mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole", so no atypical structures. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading, and if Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
