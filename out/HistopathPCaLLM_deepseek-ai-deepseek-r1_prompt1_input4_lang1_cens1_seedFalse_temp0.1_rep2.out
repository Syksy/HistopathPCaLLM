Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. Let's go through each of the three required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example translates to "biopsy". In the current case, the input mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia" which means several sampling points, and "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" refers to tissue processed as samples. The term "biopsiasta" isn't explicitly used here, but since they're talking about sampling locations and samples taken, it's likely a biopsy. However, the report doesn't clearly state the exact type. Wait, the example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. Here, the text says "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" which is more general. Maybe the sample type isn't specified here. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection), or NA. Since the text doesn't mention any surgical procedures like RP or TURP, and it's about taking samples from standard locations, it's probably a biopsy. But I need to be careful. The example had "biopsiasta" leading to "biopsy". Here, the term isn't present. Wait, the original Finnish text here is "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." "Näyttöönottokohtia" refers to sampling sites, which in the context of prostate could be biopsy. So maybe the sample type is biopsy. Alternatively, if it's unclear, maybe NA. But the example used biopsy even when the term was present. Here, since it's about taking samples from standard locations, it's likely a biopsy. So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Second, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So they can't confirm malignancy, but does that mean there's none? The key phrase is "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So the sample is inadequate to determine if there's malignancy. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since they can't assess reliably, does that mean the result is negative, or should it be NA? The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". If the sample is insufficient, maybe the malignancy field should be NA. But wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the sample is inadequate, they can't say for sure. So the answer isn't "ei" (no), because they can't confirm. So maybe "NA" here. But in the example, when there was adenocarcinoma, it was "kyllä". Here, since they can't assess, perhaps "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the text says "mitään epätyypillisiä rakenteita ei ole havaittu" (no atypical structures found). So in the observed tissue, there's nothing atypical, but the sample isn't sufficient to rule out. So the malignancy is not confirmed, but no positive findings. So maybe "ei" (no), but the problem is that the sample is inadequate. The question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they didn't find any, but the sample is insufficient, maybe the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was detected, but the adequacy is a separate issue. However, the instructions say to report based on the findings. If no malignancy was found in the sample, even if the sample is inadequate, then "ei". But if the sample is inadequate, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The NA is for when it's not applicable, but in this case, the sample is processed, but the result is inconclusive. However, the question is whether malignant findings were present. If the sample is insufficient, but no malignancy was found in what was examined, then "ei". But the report says "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä" (the sample material itself is not sufficient). So they can't exclude the presence, but in the examined sample, no malignancy was found. So the answer would be "ei" because the sample didn't show malignancy, even though the sample is inadequate. Alternatively, if the sample is inadequate, maybe the malignancy is NA. But according to the example, when there was a finding, it's "kyllä". Here, no findings, so "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei" here, then Gleason should be "NA". But wait, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". If malignancy were "kyllä", then we need to report Gleason. In this case, since the sample is inadequate and no malignancy was found, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: "biopsy" (since it's about sampling from standard locations, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: "ei" (no malignancy detected in the sample, despite insufficiency)
Gleason: "NA" (because no malignancy)
