Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "a radical prostatectomy." So the sample type here is definitely RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7, but Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the most severe is 4+5=9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value pair, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. No other parts of the text contradict this. The other blocks are clean, but since we're only considering the most severe lesion, Macro B's result is the one to use.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
