Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "a radical prostatectomy." So that's RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which clearly indicates malignancy. So that's a yes.

Now the Gleason grade. The user wants the most severe lesion's Gleason in the format major+minor=sum. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A is 4+3=7, and Macro B is 4+5=9. Since the instruction says to take the most severe, which is the higher sum, Macro B's 4+5=9 is the one to report. Even though the proportions for Macro B are 50% and 20%, which might be a bit confusing, the key is the sum. The highest sum here is 9, so that's the one to use.

Wait, but the user said "the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." So between 4+3=7 and 4+5=9, 9 is more severe. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Check if there's any other Gleason mentioned. The other parts mention no malignancy elsewhere, so no. So the final structured data should be:

Sampletype: RP (from radical prostatectomy)
Malignancy: yes (cancerous tissue)
Gleason: 4+5=9 (highest sum)

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
