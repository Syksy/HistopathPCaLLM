Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "radical prostatectomy." So that should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which clearly indicates malignancy. So that's a yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants the most severe lesion's Gleason in the format major+minor=sum. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7, with 60% pattern 4. Macro B has 4+5=9, with 50% and 20%. Since the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which would be the higher sum. Macro B's sum is 9 (4+5=9), which is higher than 7. Even though the percentages are 50% and 20%, the sum is what's important here. So the Gleason should be 4+5=9.

Wait, but the user mentioned "the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." So even if there are multiple lesions, we pick the highest Gleason score. In this case, 9 is higher than 7, so we go with 4+5=9.

Double-checking the example given. The example used 4+3=7, so the format is correct. Also, the sample type in the example was biopsy, which matches the input. So the structure here should follow that.

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I need to make sure there's no nesting and the values are exactly as allowed. Also, check that "radical prostatectomy" is correctly mapped to RP. Yes, RP is the standard abbreviation for radical prostatectomy. The malignancy is confirmed as yes. The Gleason score from the most severe (highest sum) is 4+5=9. All looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
