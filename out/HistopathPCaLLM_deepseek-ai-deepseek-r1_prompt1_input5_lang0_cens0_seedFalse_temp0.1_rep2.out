Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first sentence mentions "radical prostatectomy." So that should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which clearly indicates malignancy. So that's a yes.

Now the Gleason grade. The user wants the most severe lesion's Gleason in the format major+minor=sum. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7, and Macro B has 4+5=9. Since the instruction says to take the most severe, which is the higher sum, Macro B's 4+5=9 is the one to report. Even though the proportions for Macro B are 50% and 20%, which adds up to 70% (maybe a typo?), the key part is the Gleason sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. That should be it.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
