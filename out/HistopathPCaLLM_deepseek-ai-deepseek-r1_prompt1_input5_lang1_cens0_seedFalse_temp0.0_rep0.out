Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So here, RP is the correct choice. That's straightforward.

Next, determining malignancy. The text says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." Kasvainkudosta refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes). No ambiguity there.

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions specify to take the worst lesion's result. The report mentions two areas: Makrossa A has 4+3 with a sum of 7, and Makrossa B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the worst lesion is in B. The required format is "major+minor=sum". So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the user said to report the worst lesion. The highest sum here is 9, which comes from 4+5. So that's the one to include. The other one (4+3=7) is less severe, so we ignore it. Also, the percentages mentioned (50% and 20%) don't affect the Gleason score; it's just the highest pattern numbers. 

Double-checking the requirements: the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, and only the worst Gleason is needed. All fields are correctly filled. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. No issues here. Let's put it all together.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
