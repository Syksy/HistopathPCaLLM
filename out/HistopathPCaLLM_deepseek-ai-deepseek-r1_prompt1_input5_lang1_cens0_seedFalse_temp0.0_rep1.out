Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Tutkittavana on radikaali prostatektomia..." which translates to "The sample under examination is a radical prostatectomy..." So, the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." This means that tumor tissue was found in both apex macros, indicating malignancy. So, malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The report has two entries: in macro A, it's 4+3 with a sum of 7, and in macro B, it's 4+5 with a sum of 9. Since we need the highest (worst) Gleason score, macro B's 4+5=9 is the one to report. Even though macro A has a sum of 7, the highest sum here is 9 from macro B. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The other blocks are clean, so no other scores matter. Also, check that all values are in the correct format. Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is the highest sum. That should cover all the required fields correctly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
