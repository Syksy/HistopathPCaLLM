Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Tutkittavana on radikaali prostatektomia..." which translates to "The sample under examination is a radical prostatectomy..." So, the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." This means that tumor tissue was found in both apex macros, indicating malignancy. So, malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The report has two entries: in macro A, it's 4+3 with a sum of 7, and in macro B, it's 4+5 with a sum of 9. Since we need the highest (worst) Gleason score, macro B's 4+5=9 is the one to report. Even though the percentages for B are 50% and 20%, the sum is higher than A's 7, so 4+5=9 is the correct Gleason here.

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" as the format. So I need to make sure that the Gleason is written exactly as "4+5=9" here. The percentages mentioned (50% and 20%) don't affect the Gleason score itself, just the components. Since the highest sum is 9 from macro B, that's the one to include.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. Let me double-check the original text to confirm. Yes, macro B has 4+5=9, which is higher than A's 4+3=7. So that's correct. The other blocks are clean, so no other scores to consider. The JSON should reflect these values without any nesting, just the three fields as specified.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
