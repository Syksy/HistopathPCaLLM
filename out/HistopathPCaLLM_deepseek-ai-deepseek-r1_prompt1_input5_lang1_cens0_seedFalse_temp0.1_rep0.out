Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia". I remember from the examples that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report says there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) in both apex macros (A+B). Also, they mention Gleason scores, which are indicators of cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason. The instruction says to take the worst lesion. In the text, there are two entries: Makrossa A has 4+3=7, and Makrossa B has 4+5=9. The worst one is 4+5=9 since 9 is higher than 7. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum". In Makrossa B, it's 4+5=9. The percentages are 50% and 20%, but the highest sum is 9. So that's the one to report. The other one (4+3=7) is less severe, so we ignore it. 

Double-checking the sample type: "radikaali prostatektomia" definitely maps to "RP". Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of tumor tissue and Gleason scores. Gleason is the highest sum, which is 9. All fields seem to fit. No nested structures, just the three keys. Looks good.
