Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. Let's start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So here, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that there's "kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)", which means tumor tissue in both apex macros. Additionally, they mention Gleason scores, which are indicators of cancer. So malignancy is definitely present. The value here should be "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result. The report has two entries: in macro A, it's 4+3 with a sum of 7, and in macro B, it's 4+5 with a sum of 9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the worst lesion is in macro B. The Gleason should be "4+5=9" as per the required format.

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7". The user specified to take the pahimman leesion, which is the worst one. So even though there are two scores, we pick the highest sum. In this case, 4+5=9 is the highest, so that's the one to report.

Double-checking the sample type: radical prostatectomy is RP. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is the highest sum, which is 9. All other blocks are clean, so no other scores to consider. The answer should have these three fields correctly filled.
