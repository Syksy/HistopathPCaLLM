Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia". The options are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. "Radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)". "Kasvainkudosta" refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason. The instruction says to take the worst lesion. The text mentions two areas: Makrossa A has 4+3=7 with 60% dominant, and Makrossa B has 4+5=9 with 50% and 20%. The worst here is 4+5=9. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the highest Gleason is taken. The other blocks are clean, so no other scores matter. The answer should be in JSON with the specified keys and values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
