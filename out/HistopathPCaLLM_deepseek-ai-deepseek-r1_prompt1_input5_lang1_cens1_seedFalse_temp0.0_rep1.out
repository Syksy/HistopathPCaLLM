Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." The key word here is "prostatasta" which is the partitive case of "prostata" (prostate). The sample types allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't mention any specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It talks about samples taken from apex and basis, which are parts of the prostate, but without specifying the procedure. So I think the sample type here is NA because there's no explicit mention of the procedure type.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which implies that they couldn't reliably determine the Gleason grades. However, the presence of Gleason grading being considered (even if uncertain) might suggest malignancy. But wait, the report also mentions "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" which means they suspect a higher sum but need further tests. However, the key point for malignancy is whether there are malignant findings. The text doesn't explicitly state adenocarcinoma or malignancy. It mentions "erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä" which are different architectural patterns, but without a confirmed malignancy. Since there's no clear mention of cancer (like adenokarsinooma), maybe the malignancy is "ei" or "NA". But the uncertainty in Gleason might imply suspicion but not confirmation. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" so if there's any suspicion, maybe it's considered malignant? Hmm, but the example given in the instructions had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, since there's no explicit mention of cancer, maybe malignancy is "ei" or "NA". Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If they can't determine Gleason reliably but mention different architectures, does that mean there are malignant findings? Or is it possible that the sample is benign? The text says "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään selkeästi prostatakudosta kaikissa basis ja apex näytteenotoissa." So normal prostate tissue? But then there's mention of different architectures. Maybe it's ambiguous. However, since Gleason is not reliably determined and there's a referral for further tests, but no explicit malignancy, perhaps the malignancy is "ei" (no) or "NA". But the example had "kyllä" when Gleason was present. Wait, the user instruction says: for Gleason, if benign, use NA. So if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. But here, they tried to assess Gleason but couldn't. So maybe malignancy is "kyllä" because they are considering it, even if uncertain. But the example required explicit malignancy. Hmm. Let me re-read the text. The report says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään käyttäen kynnysarvoa kuten 50%." So they tried to assign Gleason grades but couldn't reliably do so. The presence of Gleason evaluation suggests that there is a suspicion of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. However, the user's instruction for malignancy is "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If there's no explicit mention of malignancy, but they are trying to grade it, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because they are considering it. But maybe the correct answer here is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Alternatively, since they couldn't determine Gleason, maybe it's "ei". Wait, the example had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, there's no mention of cancer, just different architectures and uncertainty in Gleason. So perhaps malignancy is "ei". But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The text says "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" which means they suspect a higher sum (Gleason) but need a second opinion. So there's suspicion of malignancy, but not confirmed. The user's instruction says to report the worst lesion. If there's suspicion but not confirmed, should malignancy be "kyllä"? Or is it only when malignancy is confirmed? The example had confirmed cancer. Here, it's unclear. Since the user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset", maybe even suspected malignancy is considered. But the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state malignancy, but mentions Gleason (even if uncertain), maybe the answer is "kyllä". Alternatively, if they can't determine Gleason, maybe it's "ei". This is a bit ambiguous. Let's think: if there's no malignancy, Gleason would be NA. If there is malignancy, Gleason is reported. Here, they tried to assess Gleason but couldn't, so maybe malignancy is "kyllä" but Gleason is NA. Wait, but the user's instruction says for Gleason: "NA" for benign. So if malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason should be a sum. But here, they couldn't determine it. So maybe in this case, malignancy is "kyllä" but Gleason is "NA". But the example had malignancy "kyllä" when Gleason was present. Alternatively, maybe the malignancy is "ei" because they couldn't confirm it. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me check the original text again. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään selkeästi prostatakudosta kaikissa basis ja apex näytteenotoissa." So normal prostate tissue? But then "erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä" – different architectural patterns between the cores. So maybe there are some atypical findings, but not definitive for cancer. Since they can't assign Gleason grades reliably, perhaps the malignancy is "ei". But I'm not sure. The user's example required explicit cancer mention. Since this report doesn't mention cancer, maybe malignancy is "ei". 

Third, Gleason. If malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". If malignancy is "kyllä", but they couldn't determine the grades, then Gleason would be "NA" as well. But according to the instructions, Gleason is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases. Here, since they can't determine the grades, even if malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason would be "NA". But the example had a clear sum. So in this case, since they can't determine the grades, Gleason is "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (no procedure mentioned), Malignancy is "ei" (no explicit cancer mentioned, only uncertain findings), Gleason is "NA". Alternatively, if the suspicion of higher sum implies malignancy, then Malignancy is "kyllä" and Gleason is "NA". But the user's instructions say to take the worst lesion. If there's a suspicion, maybe it's considered malignant. But without explicit confirmation, perhaps the answer is "ei". 

Another angle: The report says "Perustuen potilaan kliiniseen raporttiin lähetteen tehneeltä keskukselta, on todennäköistä että prostatan kapseli on ehjä ja todennäköisesti perineuraalista invaasiotakaan ei ole tapahtunut." So the capsule is intact and no perineural invasion, which are indicators of localized disease. But that doesn't confirm presence or absence of cancer. 

In the end, since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, and the Gleason couldn't be determined, I think Malignancy is "ei", leading to Gleason "NA". Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. 

Wait, but the original sample mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, leading to "biopsy". Here, the text says "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." and mentions samples from apex and basis. But the procedure isn't stated. So Sampletype is NA. 

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
