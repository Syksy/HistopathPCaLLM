Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." The term "näytekappale" translates to "sample piece" or "specimen," but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text later talks about samples taken from apex and basis, which are parts of the prostate, but without specifying the procedure. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I think the answer here is "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which implies that they couldn't reliably determine the Gleason grades. However, the presence of Gleason grading is typically associated with malignancy. But wait, the report also mentions "Erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä..." which might indicate some architectural abnormalities. However, the key point is whether malignancy is confirmed. Since they couldn't determine Gleason grades reliably and there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, maybe the malignancy is "ei" (no). But wait, the fact that they are trying to assign Gleason scores (even if not reliably) might suggest that there is malignancy. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me re-read the text. The report mentions "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" which means a suspected higher sum is referred for further testing. So there's suspicion but not confirmed. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since they are discussing Gleason grading, even if uncertain, it's possible that malignancy is present. But the text doesn't explicitly state the presence of cancer. The absence of clear malignancy indicators might lead to "ei". Alternatively, if the attempt to grade suggests malignancy, then "kyllä". But the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but refers for further tests, maybe the answer is "ei" or "NA". Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions Gleason grading attempts, perhaps the malignancy is "kyllä" because they are trying to grade it. But if they couldn't determine it reliably, maybe it's uncertain. However, the user's example had "kyllä" when Gleason was present. So maybe in this case, since they mention Gleason (even if uncertain), malignancy is "kyllä". But I need to be careful. Let me check the exact wording. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which means they can't reliably determine the major and minor grades. But the presence of Gleason grading suggests that there is a malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason score. The text states that they can't reliably determine the major and minor grades using a 50% threshold. So they can't assign a specific Gleason sum. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "NA" because it's not possible to determine. However, the example given in the instructions shows that if malignancy is present, Gleason is reported. But in this case, since they can't determine the grades, even though malignancy is suspected, the Gleason would be "NA". 

Putting it all together:
Sampletype: NA (no specific procedure mentioned)
Malignancy: kyllä (since they are attempting Gleason grading, implying malignancy)
Gleason: NA (because they couldn't determine the grades)
