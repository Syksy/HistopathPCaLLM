Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one based on the provided text.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text starts with "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." Translating that, it mentions the sample is from an enlarged prostate. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of the procedure type, just that samples were taken from apex and basis. So maybe the sampletype isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Second, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which implies that they couldn't determine the Gleason grades reliably. However, the presence of Gleason grading is typically for malignancy. But wait, the report mentions "Erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä, ja epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten." So there are suspicious architectural patterns, but it's not confirmed. The key here is whether malignancy is confirmed. Since they couldn't reliably determine Gleason, and it's referred for further examination, maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. The text doesn't explicitly state adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which led to "kyllä". Here, there's no such mention. The microscopic examination shows prostate tissue but no mention of cancer. So Malignancy might be "ei" or NA. Wait, the third field is Gleason, which is NA if benign. If malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. But the text talks about Gleason grades not being reliably determined, which suggests that there might be suspicion but not confirmed. So maybe Malignancy is "kyllä" because they are considering it, but unsure. Wait, the instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they can't determine Gleason but there are atypical architectures, does that count as malignant? Or is it uncertain? The example required explicit mention. Since the text doesn't confirm malignancy, perhaps Malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (report the worst lesion). If there's suspicion but not confirmed, maybe it's still "kyllä"? Hmm. Alternatively, since they can't determine Gleason reliably, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei". But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the text again. It says "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" – suspected higher sum referred. So there's suspicion but not confirmed. The presence of different architectures might indicate malignancy, but it's not certain. The example required explicit mention of cancer (adenokarsinooma). Since this text doesn't mention cancer, just suspicious findings, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the options are kyllä, ei, NA. If there's no explicit mention of malignancy, perhaps it's "ei". But the example had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, no such term. So Malignancy would be "ei". Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If there are findings that are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The instructions don't specify, but in medical terms, unless malignancy is confirmed, it's not reported as positive. So maybe "ei". But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if there's any mention of possible malignancy, even if uncertain, maybe "kyllä". But the example required explicit cancer mention. So in this case, since there's no explicit mention of cancer, Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason. If Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. But the text says they couldn't reliably determine major and minor grades. So even if there was suspicion, since it's not confirmed, Gleason would be NA. So the answer would be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: ei (no explicit malignancy mentioned)
Gleason: NA (since malignancy is "ei")
