Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." The term "näytekappale" translates to "sample piece" or "specimen," but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text later talks about samples taken from apex and basis, which are parts of the prostate. Since biopsies often involve taking samples from different regions like apex and base, but the original sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type here is NA because it's not explicitly mentioned.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään..." which implies that they couldn't reliably determine the Gleason grades. However, the presence of Gleason grading is typically for malignant cases. But wait, the text also mentions "Erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä," which might indicate some architectural abnormalities. However, the key point is whether malignancy is present. Since they are trying to assess Gleason but can't determine it reliably, and there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, maybe the malignancy is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, but if they are discussing Gleason, that's usually for cancer. But the text says they can't reliably define the major and minor grades. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If there's no mention of cancer, then malignancy would be "ei". But the text doesn't explicitly state the presence of cancer. The initial part says "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään selkeästi prostatakudosta kaikissa basis ja apex näytteenotoissa." So normal prostate tissue? Then maybe no malignancy. So Malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since they couldn't determine the major and minor grades reliably, and there's no sum provided, and if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason would be "NA". But the text mentions "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten." So there's a suspicion of a higher sum, but it's not confirmed. Since the Gleason is only reported for malignant cases, and if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. However, if the presence of malignancy is uncertain, but the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. But the text doesn't confirm malignancy. So maybe Malignancy is "ei", hence Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so NA. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found. Gleason is NA because no malignancy. But wait, the text mentions "epäilty suurempi summa" which might imply that there's a suspicion of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the report doesn't state adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, then malignancy is "ei". So the answer would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the original sample type isn't mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)
