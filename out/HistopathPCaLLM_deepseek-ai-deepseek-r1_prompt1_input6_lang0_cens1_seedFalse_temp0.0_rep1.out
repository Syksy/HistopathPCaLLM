Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA.

Looking at the provided statement: "Samples consist of very fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material." The term "prostatic operation material" is a bit vague. It mentions the material is fragmented and run in three separate batches. The key here is "prostatic operation material." Since it's an operation, it's likely either RP or TURP. However, the text doesn't specify which type of surgery. RP is typically the removal of the entire prostate, while TURP is a procedure to remove part of the prostate, often for benign enlargement. But without explicit mention, it's safer to go with NA here because the exact type isn't stated.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed," but most can't be inspected due to burn artifacts. The results are inconclusive. Since they didn't find any malignancy but couldn't inspect everything, the answer here should be NA because it's inconclusive. The presence of normal tissue doesn't confirm malignancy, but the inability to inspect the majority means they can't rule it out either. So, Malignancy is NA.

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since malignancy is NA here, Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any tumor findings or Gleason scores, which aligns with the inconclusive result.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the operation type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA due to inconclusive results, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of tumor grading.
