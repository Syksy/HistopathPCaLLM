Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA.

Looking at the provided statement: "Samples consist of very fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material." The term "prostatic operation material" is a bit vague. It mentions the material is fragmented and run in three batches. But the exact type isn't specified. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. So maybe the sample type is NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed," but most can't be inspected due to burn artifacts. The results are inconclusive. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected, but it's inconclusive, the answer might be "no" or "NA". Wait, allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the results are inconclusive due to technical issues, it's not confirmed. So maybe Malignancy should be NA because it's uncertain. The system can't confirm presence or absence, so NA is appropriate.

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the results are inconclusive, Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't report any Gleason scores because they couldn't inspect the material properly.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the operation type isn't specified beyond "prostatic operation material". Malignancy is NA because results are inconclusive. Gleason is NA as no grading was possible. Need to make sure the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the allowed values correctly.
