Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical for a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan" (mild prostatic hyperplasia). Hyperplasia is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. The field should be "NA".

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. The example provided uses "kyllä" for malignancy and the Gleason sum when present. Here, since it's benign, Gleason is NA. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct. No malignancy detected. All criteria met. The answer should be straightforward.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
