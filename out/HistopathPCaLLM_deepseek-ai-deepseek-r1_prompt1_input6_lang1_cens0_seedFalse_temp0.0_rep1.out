Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The input text is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "höyläyslastuja," which translates to shavings or chips. TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, and typically yields chip-like samples. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report states that the tissue is relatively normal with signs of hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Gleason score is only required if malignancy is present. Since there's no malignancy here, Gleason should be NA.

Let me double-check. The sample mentions "höyläyslastuja" which aligns with TURP. No signs of cancer, just hyperplasia. So the JSON should have Sampletype as TURP, Malignancy as ei, and Gleason as NA.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
