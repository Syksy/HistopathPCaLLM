Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. So the Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan" (mild prostatic hyperplasia). Hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The only artifacts noted are due to burning (polttoartefaktaa), which are procedural and not indicative of malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which aligns with the benign findings.

Putting it all together, the JSON should reflect TURP as the sample type, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason. I need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, with commas and quotes properly placed. Also, check that there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, which in this case, there are no malignant lesions to report.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
