Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which is typical for a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "prostatahyperplasia" (prostatic hyperplasia), which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So Malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the value should be "NA". The example given shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign diagnosis.

Double-checking each part. Sampletype is definitely TURP. Malignancy is negative. Gleason not applicable. So the JSON should reflect these values accurately.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
