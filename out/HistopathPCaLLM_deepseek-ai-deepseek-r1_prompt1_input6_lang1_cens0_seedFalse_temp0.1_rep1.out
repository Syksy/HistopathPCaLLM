Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical for a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan" (mild prostatic hyperplasia). Hyperplasia is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. The field should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy at all. The answer should be straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatahyperplasia" is benign, and the sample type from TURP. Yep, looks right.
