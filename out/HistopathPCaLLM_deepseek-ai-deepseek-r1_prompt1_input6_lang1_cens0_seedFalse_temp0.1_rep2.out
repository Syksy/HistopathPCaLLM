Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "höyläyslastuja," which translates to "shavings" or "chips." I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically results in chip-like samples. Biopsy would be needle samples, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is the entire gland. So here, the sample type should be TURP.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states that they observed "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) with some hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei."

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grading, which supports this.

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is reported, but since there's no malignancy, there's nothing to report for Gleason. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested, so straightforward key-value pairs.

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "höyläyslastuja" definitely points to TURP. No mention of cancer, just hyperplasia. All right, that seems solid.
