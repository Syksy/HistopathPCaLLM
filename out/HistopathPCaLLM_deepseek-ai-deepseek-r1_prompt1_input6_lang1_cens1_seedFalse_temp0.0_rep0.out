Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "fragmentoituneista," which translates to fragmented. The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since the sample is described as fragmented and from "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia," which might refer to surgical handling material, but it's not clear if it's TURP or RP. However, TURP specimens are often fragmented. But the text doesn't explicitly state TURP or RP. The term "biopsy" isn't mentioned here either. The sample is fragmented, which can happen in biopsies, but also in TURP. However, since the original sample type isn't clearly specified, maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa, mutta valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia riittävän tarkasti johtuen vahvasta polttoartefaktasta. Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät..." So, the visible parts are normal, but most can't be examined due to artifacts. Since no malignancy is detected in the examined parts, but the majority couldn't be assessed, does that mean malignancy is "ei" (no) or "NA"? The instructions say to report the worst lesion, but if the results are inconclusive due to artifacts, maybe malignancy is "ei" because the observed parts are normal. However, the report says the results are unclear and recommends re-examination. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they didn't find any in the parts they could examine, even if some parts couldn't be assessed, the answer might be "ei". But maybe the uncertainty leads to "NA". Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. Here, since the results are unclear, but the observed parts are normal, maybe "ei" is correct. Or perhaps "NA" because the results are inconclusive. The key is the presence of malignancy. If they can't assess most of it, but the part they saw was normal, the answer might be "ei". But the problem states to consider the worst lesion. If the worst found is normal, then "ei". But if the majority couldn't be assessed, maybe it's "NA". The user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). Since the worst found is normal, then malignancy is "ei". But if the worst couldn't be assessed, then maybe "NA". The text says "valtaosaa... ei voida tutkia" (majority couldn't be examined). But the part that was examined was normal. So the worst found is normal, so malignancy is "ei". 

Third, Gleason. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". But if malignancy is "NA", then Gleason would also be "NA". But according to the previous step, if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear. The original sample is "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia", which could be from a procedure like TURP or RP, but it's not specified. The sample is fragmented, which is common in TURP. But since the original type isn't stated, maybe NA. Alternatively, if "käsittelymateriaalia" refers to surgical handling, perhaps TURP. But I'm not certain. The user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the sample type, maybe NA. 

So the final answer would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the original type isn't specified, just that it's fragmented handling material)
Malignancy: ei (because the examined parts were normal)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)
