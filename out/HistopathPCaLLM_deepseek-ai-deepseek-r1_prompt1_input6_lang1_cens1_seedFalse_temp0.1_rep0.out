Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key word here is "fragmentoituneista", which suggests fragmented samples. The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" which is vague. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I should go with "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which translates to relatively normal prostate tissue. However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to severe burning artifacts ("vahvasta polttoartefaktasta"). The results are unclear, and re-examination is recommended. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected, but the examination was inconclusive, should I mark it as "ei" (no malignancy) or "NA"? The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when cancer is found. Here, since they saw normal tissue but couldn't examine most of it due to artifacts, maybe the malignancy status isn't confirmed. But the presence of normal tissue might suggest no malignancy found in the examined parts. However, the report says the results are unclear. The safest choice here might be "NA" because the examination was inconclusive. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If they didn't find any malignancy in the parts they could examine, even if some parts couldn't be assessed, maybe the answer is "ei". But the example had a clear finding. Here, the report says "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" but the majority couldn't be assessed. Since the malignancy is not confirmed, maybe "ei" is appropriate. Hmm, but the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If no malignancy was found in the parts examined, even if some parts couldn't be checked, then "ei" would be correct. But if the report is unclear, maybe "NA" is better. The example uses "kyllä" when cancer is found. Here, since they didn't find cancer in the parts they could examine, despite some areas being unclear, perhaps "ei" is the answer. But the user instructions mention "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If no malignancy was found, then "ei". But if the results are unclear, maybe "NA". The report says "Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät" (results are unclear). So maybe "NA" is better here because the malignancy status can't be determined definitively. But the example didn't have that scenario. Let me check the original text again. The report mentions "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (normal prostate tissue) but most couldn't be examined. So in the examined parts, no malignancy, but the rest couldn't be assessed. Since the worst lesion found is normal, then malignancy would be "ei". But if the majority couldn't be assessed, does that affect it? The user instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". So even if some parts couldn't be examined, if the worst found is benign, then malignancy is "ei". So in this case, since the examined parts showed normal tissue, the malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA" because the original sample type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because the examined parts were normal. Gleason is "NA" because no malignancy was found.
