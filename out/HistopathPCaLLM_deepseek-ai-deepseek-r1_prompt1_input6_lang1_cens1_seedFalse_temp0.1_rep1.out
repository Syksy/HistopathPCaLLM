Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "fragmentoituneista", which suggests fragmented samples. The original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" (prostate treatment material), but without a specific procedure named. So, I might have to go with "NA" here since it's not clear.

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which translates to "relatively normal prostate tissue microscopically". However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to severe burning artifacts ("vahvasta polttoartefaktasta"). The results are unclear, and re-examination is recommended. Since the main observation is normal tissue but the majority couldn't be assessed, there's no mention of malignancy. But the absence of detected malignancy doesn't necessarily mean "ei" because the sample was inadequate. The report says the results are inconclusive. So, maybe "NA" is appropriate here because the presence of malignancy couldn't be determined due to technical issues.

Finally, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed (we put "NA" for malignancy), the Gleason should also be "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason grades in the text. The report doesn't indicate any cancer found, just normal tissue where assessable, but most couldn't be examined. So, no Gleason score would be reported here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy is inconclusive due to artifacts, so "NA". Gleason isn't applicable, so "NA".
