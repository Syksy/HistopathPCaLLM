Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "fragmentoituneista", which suggests fragmented samples. The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia" which could be post-treatment material, but without a specific procedure named. So, I might have to go with "NA" here since there's no clear indication of the sample type among the allowed options.

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which translates to "relatively normal prostate tissue". However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to burn artifacts. Since no malignancy is detected in the examined parts, but there's uncertainty due to technical issues, the conclusion here might be that there's no evidence of malignancy in the parts they could examine. But the results are unclear. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the visible parts are normal, even if some areas couldn't be assessed, the answer might be "ei". But I need to be careful here. The report says the results are unclear and recommends re-examination. However, the presence of malignancy is based on what was found. Since they didn't find any malignancy in the parts they could examine, even if some areas were unclear, the answer should be "ei". If there was any mention of suspicion or possible malignancy, it might be different, but here it's stated as normal tissue where visible. So "ei" seems appropriate.

For Gleason score: The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei" here, the Gleason should be "NA". There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading in the report. The text talks about normal tissue and artifacts, so no Gleason score would be reported. Thus, "NA" is correct.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original procedure isn't specified, malignancy is "ei" because no cancer was found in the examined areas, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy detected.
