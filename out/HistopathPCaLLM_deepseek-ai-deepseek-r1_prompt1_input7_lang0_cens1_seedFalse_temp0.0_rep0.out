Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected according to provided instructions." It mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the method. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, determining malignancy. The report says there's a point of interest with atypical structures and morphological changes, but it's too small to draw definite conclusions. The rest of the material is normal. Since no definite malignancy is identified, Malignancy should be "no". Even though there are atypical findings, the absence of a conclusive diagnosis points to "no" rather than "yes" or NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason field should be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with this.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is "no", and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Check the example again to confirm formatting. All set.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
