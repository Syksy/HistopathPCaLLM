Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected according to provided instructions." It mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the method. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but states that "no definite conclusions could be drawn." Since there's uncertainty and no confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA. Even though there's a point of interest, it's not conclusive for cancer.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum." However, since the malignancy isn't confirmed (it's NA), the Gleason should also be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores, just some atypical findings that aren't definitive.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA due to no confirmed malignancy or scores mentioned.
