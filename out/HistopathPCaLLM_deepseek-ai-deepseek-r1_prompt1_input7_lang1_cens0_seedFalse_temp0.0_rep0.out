Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsiat..." which translates to "prostate biopsies taken in the usual manner in cassettes...". So the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. That should be "biopsy".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with small glandular structures, nuclear atypia, and a morphological finding that might correspond to adenocarcinoma. However, it's mentioned that the finding is so scant that it remains at a suspicion level, and no definite adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal glandular tissue. Since there's a suspicion but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, does this count as malignant? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Suspicion might not be enough for a "kyllä", but the presence of atypia and possible adenocarcinoma could lean towards "kyllä". However, the key phrase here is "jää suspisio-asteelle, eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" which means it's on the suspicion level and no clear adenocarcinoma found. So maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed? But the question is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, perhaps the answer is "ei". Wait, the original example had a clear adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". But the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, the report says "saattaisi vastata adenokarsinoomaa" (might correspond to adenocarcinoma) but it's not definite. So perhaps the malignancy is not confirmed, hence "ei". But I need to check the exact wording. The user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if there's any mention of possible malignancy, should it be "kyllä"? This is a bit ambiguous. However, the example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". But I need to be careful. The text says "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää" (no clear). So the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason score. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei" in this case, the Gleason should be "NA". However, wait, the report doesn't mention any Gleason score. Even if there was a suspicion, if no Gleason is reported, it's "NA". So in this case, since there's no Gleason mentioned, and malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "prostatabiopsiat")
Malignancy: ei (no definite adenocarcinoma found)
Gleason: NA (no Gleason reported and malignancy is "ei")

I need to make sure there's no mention of Gleason in the text. Scanning through the report again: no, there's no mention of Gleason scores. The example had Gleason 4+3=7, but here it's not present. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
