Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsiat..." which translates to "prostate biopsies taken in the usual manner in cassettes...". So the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. That should be "biopsy".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with small glandular structures, nuclear atypia, and a morphological finding that might correspond to adenocarcinoma. However, it's mentioned that the finding is so scant that it remains at a suspicion level, and no definite adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal glandular tissue. Since there's a suspicion but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, does this count as malignant? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Suspicion might not be enough for a "kyllä", but the presence of atypia and possible adenocarcinoma could lean towards "kyllä". However, the key phrase here is "jää suspisio-asteelle, eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" which means it's on the suspicion level and no clear adenocarcinoma found. So maybe "ei" because it's not confirmed? But the question is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, perhaps the answer is "ei". Wait, the original example had a clear adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). The worst here is a suspicion, not confirmed. So maybe "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy. Alternatively, if suspicion is considered as possible malignancy, but according to medical reporting, only confirmed malignancies are reported. So I think "ei" is correct here.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, unless a Gleason was reported, which it isn't here. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades. So definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
