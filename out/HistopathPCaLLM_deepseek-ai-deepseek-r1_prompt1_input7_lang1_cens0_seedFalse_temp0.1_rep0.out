Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsiat..." which translates to "Prostate biopsies taken in the usual way in cassettes...". So the sample type here is definitely a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with small glandular structures, nuclear atypia, and a morphological finding that might correspond to adenocarcinoma. However, it's noted as being so scant that it remains suspicious, and no definite adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. Since there's a suspicion but no definitive malignancy, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei"? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Suspicious might still be considered as possible malignancy, but the user specified "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" is safer. Wait, but the example given in the problem had a case where adenocarcinoma was detected, leading to "kyllä". Here, it's a suspicion without confirmation. The key phrase is "eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found). So the answer here should be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, unless malignancy is confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. The example given only included Gleason when malignancy was present. So here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Let me double-check the text to make sure I didn't miss anything. The report mentions suspicion but no definite adenocarcinoma. Other samples are normal. So yes, no malignancy. Therefore, the JSON should reflect that.
