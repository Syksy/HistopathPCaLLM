Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsiat, kokonaispituus n. 150mm." The key word here is "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "fokus, jossa pieniä rauhasrakenteita, missä tuma-atypiaa ja morfologinen löydös saattaisi vastata adenokarsinoomaa." This translates to a focus with some features that might indicate adenocarcinoma, but it's described as "niin niukka että jää suspisio-asteelle, eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" – meaning it's so scant that it's only suspicious, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. So there's suspicion but not a definitive malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's not confirmed, but there's suspicion, I need to check the criteria. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's only suspicious and not confirmed, does that count as "ei" (no) or "kyllä" (yes)? The example given in the problem had a clear adenocarcinoma, so "kyllä". Here, since it's not definitive, maybe "ei". But the text says "saattaisi vastata adenokarsinoomaa" (could correspond to adenocarcinoma), but it's not certain. The user's instructions say to report only the worst lesion. However, since the conclusion is that no clear adenocarcinoma is found, the malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports this.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".
