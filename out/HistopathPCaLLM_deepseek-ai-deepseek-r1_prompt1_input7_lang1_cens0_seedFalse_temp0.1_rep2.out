Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions a focus in sample 1B where there's some suspicion of adenocarcinoma due to nuclear atypia and morphology, but it's too scant to confirm. The key phrases here are "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää adenokarsinoomaa" (no clear adenocarcinoma). Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, the malignancy isn't definitively present. However, the presence of atypia might lean towards a cautious approach. But according to the instructions, only the worst lesion's results should be considered. Since the other samples are normal, and the main one is only suspicious without confirmation, the malignancy answer should be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy found. Wait, but the first part mentions "saattaisi vastata adenokarsinoomaa" (could correspond to adenocarcinoma). However, the next sentence clarifies that it's too scant and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. So the conclusion is that malignancy isn't confirmed. Hence, "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.
