Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Prostata biopsiasta havaitaan..." in the example translates to "biopsy". In the current case, the text starts with "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The key word here is "prostatanäytemateriaalia", which just means prostate sample material. But the example used "biopsiasta" to determine "biopsy". Here, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified, so I should put "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "Yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia." Atypical structures and morphological changes might suggest suspicion, but it's stated that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, and the atypical findings are inconclusive, the malignancy answer should be "ei" (no) because there's no confirmed malignancy. Wait, but "ei" means "no malignant findings", but the text says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion. Hmm. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, even if there's suspicion but it's inconclusive, then maybe "ei" is correct. Because the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If they couldn't confirm, then technically, the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if there's uncertainty, maybe "NA"? But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example had a clear malignancy. Here, the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, so maybe "ei" because no definitive malignancy was found. Or "NA" if the presence is uncertain. The example's malignancy was "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, since it's inconclusive but no definitive malignancy, perhaps "ei". But I need to check the exact wording. The text says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion could be made). So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, "ei" would mean there were no malignant findings. But there were atypical findings. However, the question is about whether there were malignant findings. If they can't confirm, then the answer is "ei" (no) because the sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. So "Malignancy" should be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no definitive malignancy. Gleason is "NA".
