Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are given, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, let's look at the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "Prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The key word here is "kerättiin", which means collected. The term "prostatanäytemateriaalia" translates to prostate sample material. Since it's collected routinely, and there's no mention of surgery like prostatectomy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), this is likely a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "Yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia." Atyypilliset rakenteet (atypical structures) and morphological changes can be suspicious, but the report states that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, but there are atypical findings, does that count as malignant? However, the key point is that "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä". So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since the result is inconclusive, but there's some suspicion, but the question is whether malignancy is present. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, so maybe "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the findings are inconclusive and no definitive diagnosis is made, then technically, the answer would be "ei" because malignancy isn't confirmed. But the presence of atypical structures might suggest possible malignancy, but since it's not definitive, perhaps "ei" is correct. Alternatively, if the sample has some atypical cells but not enough to confirm malignancy, maybe "ei" because the final conclusion is that no definitive malignancy was found. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
