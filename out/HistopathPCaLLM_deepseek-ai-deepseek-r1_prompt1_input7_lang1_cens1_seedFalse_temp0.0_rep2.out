Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text mentions "Prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The term "prostata biopsiasta" in the example was mapped to "biopsy". Here, the sample is just "prostatanäytemateriaalia" (prostate sample material) collected routinely. There's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think the sample type isn't specified here, so it should be "NA".

Second, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (atypical structures and morphological changes), which could suggest suspicion. However, it's noted that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, and the atypical findings are inconclusive, the malignancy answer should be "ei" because it's not confirmed. Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" (Were there malignant findings?). If the findings are inconclusive and not definitive, does that count as "ei" or "NA"? The example had a clear malignancy. Here, since they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, maybe "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Alternatively, if the atypical findings are considered uncertain, maybe "NA". But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion), and the rest was normal, maybe malignancy is "ei" because there's no definitive malignant findings. So "ei".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since there's no mention of Gleason scores here, and malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA.
