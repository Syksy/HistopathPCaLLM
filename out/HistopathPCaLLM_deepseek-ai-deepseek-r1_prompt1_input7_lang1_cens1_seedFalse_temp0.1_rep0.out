Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The user wants three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, which was translated to "biopsy". Looking at the input text here: the first sentence mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" which is Finnish for "prostate biopsy". So the sample type here should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" which translates to "interesting finding with atypical structures and morphological changes". However, it goes on to say that the finding was so small that no definitive conclusion could be made, and the rest of the material showed typical expected structures. So there's suspicion of malignancy due to atypical cells, but it's not confirmed. The question is whether to mark malignancy as "kyllä" or "ei" or "NA". The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since the atypical findings are present but not definitive, maybe the malignancy is uncertain. But the options are only yes, no, or NA. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, but there's an atypical finding, perhaps "kyllä" isn't correct. Wait, the key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" which means malignant findings. If the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion because the finding was too small, and the rest was normal, then maybe the malignancy is "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy. But the presence of atypical structures might be considered as possible malignancy. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, since it's uncertain, but there's some atypical changes, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if it's uncertain. But the options are strict. The report states that no definitive conclusion could be made, so perhaps the malignancy is "ei" because there's no confirmed malignancy. Or maybe "NA" if the presence of malignancy is not determined. Wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – "Were there malignant findings in the sample?" If the answer is that they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, then maybe it's "ei" because they didn't confirm it. But the presence of atypical structures might be considered as possible, but not confirmed. So according to the instructions, only the worst lesion's results should be reported. Since the rest of the material was normal, and the atypical was too small to conclude, the worst lesion here is the atypical, but it's not confirmed as malignant. Therefore, malignancy would be "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy found. Alternatively, if the presence of atypical is considered as possible malignancy, but the options are strict. The example had a clear malignancy. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei". Or maybe "NA" if the information isn't available. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, perhaps the answer is "ei" because the sample doesn't have confirmed malignant findings. Alternatively, maybe "NA" if the presence is uncertain. But I think "ei" is more appropriate here because the conclusion is that no definitive malignancy was found, despite some atypical features. So malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" in this case, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "biopsy", Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
