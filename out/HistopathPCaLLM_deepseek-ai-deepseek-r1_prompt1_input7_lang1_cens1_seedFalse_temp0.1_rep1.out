Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: the text starts with "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The key word here is "prostatanäytemateriaalia", which translates to prostate sample material. However, the exact type isn't specified. It doesn't mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think the sample type here is "NA" because the type isn't explicitly stated.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "Yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia." Atyypilliset rakenteet (atypical structures) and morphologic changes can be suspicious, but it's stated that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, but there's an inconclusive finding, does that count as "ei" (no) or "NA"? The example had "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, since it's uncertain and no definitive malignancy is diagnosed, maybe "ei" because the report doesn't confirm malignancy. But wait, the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings). If the findings are inconclusive, but there's some atypical changes, does that count as malignant? Probably not. Since they couldn't make a definitive conclusion and the rest was normal, the answer should be "ei". But I need to be careful. The key is whether malignancy is confirmed. Since it's not confirmed, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports this.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no definitive malignancy was found. Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy. Let me check the example again. In the example, when malignancy was present, Gleason was provided. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That makes sense.
