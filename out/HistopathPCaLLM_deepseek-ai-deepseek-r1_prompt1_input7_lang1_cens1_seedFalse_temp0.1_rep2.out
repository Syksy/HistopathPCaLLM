Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "Prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The term "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example translated to "biopsy". Here, the term "kerättiin" (collected) might indicate a biopsy, but the exact type isn't specified. However, since it's a routine collection, maybe it's a biopsy. Wait, but the example used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe the sample type isn't specified, hence "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (atypical structures and morphological changes), which could be suspicious. However, it's stated that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, but there's some atypical findings, but not enough to confirm malignancy. The question is whether "Malignancy" should be "ei" (no) because it's not confirmed, or "NA" because it's inconclusive. The example had a clear malignancy, but here it's uncertain. The instructions say to report "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. Since the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, maybe "ei" isn't correct. Alternatively, since there's some atypical but not definitive, maybe "NA" is appropriate. Wait, the options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". If the report is inconclusive, then "NA" might be the right choice here. Because "ei" would mean no malignancy was found, but in reality, there's some atypical changes but not enough to confirm. So "NA" for malignancy.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "NA" here, the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so "NA". Malignancy is inconclusive, so "NA". Gleason is "NA" because no malignancy confirmed.
