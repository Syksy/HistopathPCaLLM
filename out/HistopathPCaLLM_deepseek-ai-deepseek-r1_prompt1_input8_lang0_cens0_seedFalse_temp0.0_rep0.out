Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, Sample 3 mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate". So RP is the sample type here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and mentions invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main sample (Sample 3) has a tumor. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the highest identified is 4+3=7. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", so I need to present it as "4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is still 4+3=7. 

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text refers to the highest Gleason as 4+3=7, so that's the one to use. The other findings like high-grade PIN changes are noted but don't affect the Gleason score here. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. The JSON should not have any nested structures, just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example to ensure correctness. Yep, that looks right.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
