Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, Sample 3 is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy preparate." So RP is the correct value here. The other samples are lymph nodes, but the main sample type for the prostate is RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report states that in sample 3, "tumor tissue is observed" with invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion here is the prostate sample. Since tumor tissue is mentioned and it's malignant (adenocarcinoma), the answer should be yes.

For Gleason, the highest identified is 4+3=7. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum," so "4+3=7" is correct. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is what's needed. The other Gleason details like high-grade PIN changes are noted but not the primary Gleason grade here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. Need to make sure the JSON is valid without nested structures and only the most severe lesion (which is in sample 3) is considered. The lymph nodes are negative, but the main sample is the prostatectomy with malignancy.
