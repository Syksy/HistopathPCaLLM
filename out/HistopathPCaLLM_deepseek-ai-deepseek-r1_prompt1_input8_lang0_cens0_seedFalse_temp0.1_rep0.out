Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as a "radical prostatectomy preparate". So RP should be the answer here. The other samples are lymph nodes, but the main sample type for the prostate is RP.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that in sample 3, tumor tissue is observed with invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion is in the prostate. Since the most severe lesion is considered, which is the tumor in sample 3, malignancy should be yes.

For the Gleason grade, the highest identified is 4+3=7. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7" is correct. Even though there's mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So that's the value to report.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion's data is taken. The lymph nodes are benign, but the prostate sample has malignancy. The Gleason score from the prostate is the relevant one here. Also, check that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and the keys are correct. The sample type is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. That should be it.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
