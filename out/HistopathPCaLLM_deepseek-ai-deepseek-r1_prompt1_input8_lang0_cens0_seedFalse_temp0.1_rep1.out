Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as a "radical prostatectomy preparate". So that should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and mentions "invasive properties". Also, the lymph nodes are "free from malignant findings", but the main sample (Sample 3) has the tumor. So Malignancy should be yes.

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7". Even though it mentions lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So that's the value to use.

Need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. Since Sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the highest Gleason, that's the one to report. The other samples (lymph nodes) are negative but not the primary sample.

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+3=7
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
