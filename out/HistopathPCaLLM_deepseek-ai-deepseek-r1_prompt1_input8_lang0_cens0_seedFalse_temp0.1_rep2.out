Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy preparate". So RP should be the answer here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and mentions invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main sample (Sample 3) has malignant findings. So the answer here is yes.

For Gleason, the highest identified is 4+3=7. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7" is correct. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is what's needed. 

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The main sample (Sample 3) is the radical prostatectomy, which has the Gleason 4+3=7. The lymph nodes are benign, but the primary sample's findings are malignant. So the structured JSON should reflect Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as yes, and Gleason as 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
