Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "samples with indices 1, 2, 3". The third sample mentions "prostate tissue of interest" and is run according to the routine protocol. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The report doesn't mention if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that samples 1 and 2 were confirmed free of malignant findings. However, sample 3 has some suspicious changes like immunological activity and PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes discussed. But PIN is not malignant; it's a pre-cancerous condition. The report mentions "no grade score is reported" and "empty fields" for major and minor Gleason patterns. Since the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing and there's no confirmation of malignancy in sample 3, only samples 1 and 2 are explicitly stated as non-malignant. But the most severe lesion would be in sample 3. However, the text doesn't confirm malignancy there, only suspicion. So Malignancy should be "no" because the only confirmed findings are non-malignant in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3's findings are not confirmed as malignant.

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason would be NA. Even though there's mention of lower grade covering above 10%, no actual grade is reported, and the fields are empty. So no valid Gleason score is provided.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.
