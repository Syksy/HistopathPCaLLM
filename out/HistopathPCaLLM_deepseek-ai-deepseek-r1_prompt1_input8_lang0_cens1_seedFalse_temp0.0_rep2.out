Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "samples with indices 1, 2, 3". The third sample mentions "prostate tissue of interest" and is run according to the "routine protocol". However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says that samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings". Sample 3 mentions "suspicion of PIN-changes" which are not malignant. PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is a pre-malignant condition. Since the highest Gleason patterns are missing and there's no confirmed malignancy in sample 3, Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason, the report mentions that the major and minor fields are empty, and the lower grade covered over 10% but no grade is reported. Since there's no Gleason score provided, even though there's a mention of lower grade, the Gleason value should be "NA" because there's no actual score given.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is no because no samples had malignant findings (samples 1 and 2 are clear, sample 3 has suspicion but not confirmed), and Gleason is NA because no valid score is reported.
