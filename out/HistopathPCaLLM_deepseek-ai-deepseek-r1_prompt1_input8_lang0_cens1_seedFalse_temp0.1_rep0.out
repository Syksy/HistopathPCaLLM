Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions samples with indices 1, 2, and 3. Sample 3 has the majority of the prostate tissue of interest and is run according to the routine protocol. The other samples (1 and 2) are non-primary tissue. However, the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just refers to "samples" which might be from a biopsy, but since it's not clearly stated, maybe the answer here is NA.

Next, malignancy. The samples in index 1 and 2 are confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings. Sample 3 has some interesting properties, but the highest Gleason patterns are missing, and there's a suspicion of PIN changes (which are pre-malignant). Since the malignant findings are absent in samples 1 and 2, and sample 3 doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions lower grade covering over 10% but no grade score, maybe the malignancy is "no". However, PIN is not malignant, so if there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or confirmed malignancy, then malignancy would be "no".

For Gleason grade, the text says the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor. The lower grade covered above 10% but no grade is reported. Since there's no actual Gleason score provided, even though there's a mention of lower grade, the Gleason should be NA because it's not reported properly.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, malignancy is "no" because samples 1 and 2 are free and sample 3 doesn't confirm malignancy, and Gleason is NA due to missing data.
