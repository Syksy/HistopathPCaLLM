Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". Radikaaliprostatektomia translates to radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here is "RP". The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but since we're only looking for the worst lesion, which is in sample 3, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report states "Löydetty korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7", which indicates cancer. Also, the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy ("ei maligneja löydöksiä"), but the main sample (3) does. So malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the highest mentioned is 4+3=7. Even though there's a lower grade component (3 with 30% share), the instruction says to report the worst lesion. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst case is reported. All other details like high-grade PIN or inflammation are irrelevant here. The JSON keys are Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Values are "RP", "kyllä", and "4+3=7" respectively.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
