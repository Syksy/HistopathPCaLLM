Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the Sampletype can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample in question is sample 3, which mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". "Radikaaliprostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, so the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) that is invasive. Additionally, they found "high grade PIN -muutoksia", which are pre-malignant changes. However, the key point is the presence of tumor tissue, which is malignant. The lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) didn't show malignancy (0/6), but the main sample (sample 3) does have malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text explicitly mentions "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. The requirement is to report the worst lesion's result, so we take "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the three fields. Also, check that the values are in the correct format. Sampletype is "RP", Malignancy is "kyllä", and Gleason is "4+3=7". The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes without malignancy, but the focus is on sample 3, which is the radical prostatectomy sample with malignancy and the specified Gleason score.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
