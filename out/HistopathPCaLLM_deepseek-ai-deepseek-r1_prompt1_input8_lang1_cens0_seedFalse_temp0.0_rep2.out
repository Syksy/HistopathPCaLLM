Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the Sampletype can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample in question is sample 3, which mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". The Finnish term "radikaaliprostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, so the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) that is invasive. Additionally, they mention "high grade PIN -muutoksia", which are pre-malignant but not malignant. However, the presence of invasive tumor tissue indicates malignancy. The lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) don't show malignancy, but the main sample (sample 3) does. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text explicitly says "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. The requirement is to report the worst lesion's result, so we take "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the three fields. Also, check that the values are in the correct format. No other samples (like 1 and 2) are considered since the focus is on sample 3, which is the radical prostatectomy. The lymph nodes are negative, but the main sample is positive, so malignancy is "kyllä". Gleason is straightforward as given. All conditions seem met.
