Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignesty, and Gleason. Let me break down the requirements.

First, the Sampletype can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". Radikaaliprostatektomia translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype for Näyte 3 should be "RP". The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but since the focus is on the worst lesion, which is in sample 3, the primary sample type here is RP.

Next, determining malignancy. The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which indicates malignant tumor invasion. Also, the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy ("ei maligneja löydöksiä"). But since we're considering the worst lesion, which is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the text explicitly mentions "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. The example provided uses the biopsy case, but here the sample type is RP. Also, checking that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. No issues there. So the final JSON should look like the example but with the values adjusted based on the given report.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
