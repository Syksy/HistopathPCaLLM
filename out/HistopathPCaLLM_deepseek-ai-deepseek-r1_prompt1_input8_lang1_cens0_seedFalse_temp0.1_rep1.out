Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the requirements.

First, the Sampletype can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample in question is from "näyte 3", which mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". "Radikaaliprostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, so the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, determining Malignancy. The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) that is invasive. Additionally, they mention "high grade PIN -muutoksia", which are pre-malignant changes, but the key here is the presence of tumor tissue. The imusolmukkeet (lymph nodes) don't show malignancy (0/6), but the main sample (näyte 3) does have malignant findings. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text explicitly states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. The requirement is to report the highest (pahin) lesion, so we take "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. Need to ensure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and only the highest Gleason is included. Double-checking the original text for any possible errors, but everything seems to align with the required fields.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
