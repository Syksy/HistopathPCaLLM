Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". Radikaaliprostatektomia translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype for the third sample should be "RP". But wait, the user wants the worst lesion's results. Since the malignant findings are in sample 3, that's the one we should consider. So Sampletype is "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta, joka invasoi..." which indicates malignancy. Also, the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) don't have malignant findings (0/6), but the main sample (3) does. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. Each field is straightforward. The worst lesion is in sample 3, which is RP, malignant, and Gleason 4+3=7. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes without malignancy, but since the question is about the worst lesion, we focus on sample 3.
