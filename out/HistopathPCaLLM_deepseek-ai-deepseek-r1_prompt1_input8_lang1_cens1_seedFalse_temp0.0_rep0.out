Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "näytteet" which is Finnish for samples. The first part mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3". The report doesn't explicitly state the type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. However, since it's a prostate sample, and the samples are numbered, it might be a biopsy, but the text doesn't specify. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text says that samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has some interesting features, but the highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a mention of possible lower grade covering 10% but the grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error. However, since samples 1 and 2 are benign, but sample 3 has some suspicious features but no confirmed malignancy (since Gleason is missing), maybe the overall malignancy is "ei" (no) because the confirmed samples (1 and 2) are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain. But wait, the user instructions say to consider the worst lesion. If sample 3 has possible malignancy but it's unclear, but the Gleason is missing, maybe the malignancy is "kyllä" (yes) if there's any mention, but the text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. Hmm. The key is that the worst lesion's results should be reported. The text mentions that the highest Gleason grade is missing, but there's a suspicion of lower grade. However, since the Gleason isn't confirmed, maybe the malignancy is "ei" because the confirmed samples are free, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive. Alternatively, if the presence of any suspicious features (even if uncertain) counts as malignant, but the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain (no confirmed Gleason, possible clerical error), maybe the malignancy is "ei". But I need to be careful here. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, and sample 3's analysis mentions possible features but no clear malignancy. So overall, the answer for Malignancy might be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", then Gleason would be NA. But wait, if the malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. However, if there's any mention of Gleason, even if incomplete, but the malignancy is "kyllä", then we need to report it. But in this case, the text says the highest Gleason grade is missing, with question marks in major and minor. So even if there was a suspicion, since it's not confirmed, and the malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The text doesn't specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA".

Malignancy: Samples 1 and 2 are free, sample 3 is inconclusive but no confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

Gleason: Since malignancy is "ei", "NA".
