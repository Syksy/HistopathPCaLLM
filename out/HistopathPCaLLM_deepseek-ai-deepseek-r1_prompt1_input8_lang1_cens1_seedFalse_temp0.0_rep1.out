Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text to find the necessary information.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3". The term "näytteet" translates to samples, and since they are numbered, this might refer to biopsy samples. However, the text also says "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but here it's not explicitly stated. Wait, the example had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". In the current case, the samples are numbered, and the third sample is processed according to routine protocol. But there's no clear mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't specify the sample type, so maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states that samples 1 and 2 were found to be free of malignancies ("maligniteeteista vapaita"). However, sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) and mentions "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (varying growth patterns). But it also says the highest Gleason grade seems to be missing, and there's a possible entry error. The immunologic activity is noted, but it's related to normal inflammatory changes. There's suspicion of PIN changes, but PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is not malignancy. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive with no confirmed malignancy, maybe Malignancy is "ei". Wait, but sample 3's description is a bit ambiguous. However, the key point is that the highest Gleason is missing, and the grade value is missing. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. If the major and minor are marked as ? and ?, and the grade is missing, perhaps it's not confirmed as malignant. Also, the text says samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain. So overall, maybe Malignancy is "ei" because no confirmed malignancy is reported. But wait, the example had "kyllä" when Gleason was present. Here, Gleason is missing, so maybe Malignancy is "ei". But the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If sample 3 has some suspicious features but no confirmed malignancy, then maybe Malignancy is "ei". Alternatively, if there's any mention of malignancy, but in this case, samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. So "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. But let's check the text. It says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin; ilmeisesti matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä, mutta itse graden arvo puuttuu, mahdollisesti kirjausvirhe." So the major and minor are marked as question marks, and the grade values are missing. Even though there's a mention of a lower grade covering 10%, the actual Gleason score isn't provided. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the type isn't specified), Malignancy is "ei" (since samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive), and Gleason is NA.
