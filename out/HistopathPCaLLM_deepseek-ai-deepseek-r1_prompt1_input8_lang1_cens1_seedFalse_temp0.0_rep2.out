Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of these fields one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3". The mention of "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and the context of examining samples suggests these are biopsy samples. The text doesn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I think the sample type here is "biopsy". But wait, the third sample is processed according to routine protocol, but the original type isn't explicitly stated. However, since the first two are numbered and the third is part of the same set, it's likely all are biopsies. So Sampletype would be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says that samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) and mentions "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (varying growth patterns), but there's a suspicion of inflammatory changes. However, the highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a possible entry error. The key point is that samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed. But the instruction says to report the worst lesion. Wait, the user specified to take into account only the worst lesion's results. So even if samples 1 and 2 are benign, if sample 3 has malignancy, then Malignancy would be "kyllä". But in this case, sample 3's findings are unclear. The text mentions that the highest Gleason grade is missing, with a question mark in major and minor. There's a lower grade covering 10% but the actual grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error. Also, suspicions of PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes were discussed. PIN is not cancer, but can be a precursor. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed, and the Gleason is missing, maybe the malignancy here is "ei"? Wait, but the samples 1 and 2 are free, but sample 3's status is uncertain. However, the user wants the worst lesion. If there's no confirmed malignancy in any sample, then Malignancy is "ei". But the text says "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" which might be suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. Since the Gleason is missing and there's a possible clerical error, and the highest grade is not identified, perhaps the malignancy is "ei". So Malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA". But wait, let's double-check. The text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin; ilmeisesti matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä, mutta itse graden arvo puuttuu, mahdollisesti kirjausvirhe." So the Gleason grades are missing, with question marks. There's a lower grade covering 10%, but the actual value is missing. Since there's no confirmed Gleason score (major and minor are unknown), even if there's a suspicion, the Gleason can't be determined. Therefore, since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since all samples are likely biopsies)
Malignancy: ei (since the worst sample, sample 3, doesn't confirm malignancy)
Gleason: NA (because malignancy is "ei" and Gleason isn't determinable)
