Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract structured data from a given histopathological report on prostate cancer and format it into a JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let's break down the information provided in the sample text.

First, the sample text is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully. The key points to look for are:

1. **Sampletype**: The original type of the sample, which can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" (Numbered samples 1 and 2) and "Näyte 3" (Sample 3). The third sample contains most of the prostate tissue and is processed according to routine protocol. The term "prostata biopsiasta" in the example was translated to "biopsy". Here, the samples are numbered, but the type isn't explicitly stated. However, since they are numbered and the context is prostate examination, it's possible they are biopsy samples. The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta", so maybe here the samples are biopsies. But if not explicitly stated, maybe "NA"? Wait, the third sample is processed routinely, which might imply it's a TURP or RP, but the text doesn't specify. The user instructions say to use "NA" if not clear. So maybe Sampletype is "NA"?

Wait, let's check again. The example had "biopsy" because the text said "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the samples are numbered 1, 2, 3, but the type isn't specified. The third sample is "suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta" (most of the prostate tissue under examination) and processed routinely. Could this be a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or RP (radical prostatectomy)? Without explicit mention, it's hard to tell. The user might expect "NA" here. But maybe the samples are biopsies. However, the example used "biopsy" when the word was present. Here, since it's not mentioned, perhaps "NA" is safer.

2. **Malignancy**: Whether there are malignant findings. The text says that samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), but the highest Gleason grade is missing. There's a mention of "matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä" (lower grade covered about 10% of the sample), but the actual grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error. Also, suspicions of PIN changes (which are pre-malignant) were discussed. However, since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's malignancy is unclear. The key is whether there's any malignancy. The report says samples 1 and 2 are free, but sample 3's status is ambiguous. The text mentions "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia" but doesn't confirm malignancy. The Gleason grade is missing. So, since the worst sample is sample 3, but it's unclear if it's malignant. However, the presence of "lower grade" might imply some malignancy, but the user instructions say to report "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. If the Gleason is missing due to clerical error, but there's a mention of lower grade covering 10%, does that mean it's malignant? Wait, Gleason grading applies only to adenocarcinoma. If they can't determine the grade because of missing data, but there's a lesion, maybe it's considered malignant. But the text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (The highest identified Gleason grade seems to be missing), and "itse graden arvo puuttuu" (the actual grade value is missing). So maybe the presence of malignancy is uncertain. However, samples 1 and 2 are benign, sample 3 has some features but no confirmed Gleason. The question is whether the pathologist identified malignancy. Since the Gleason is missing, but there's a mention of "lower grade", perhaps there's a suspicion but not confirmed. The user instructions say "Malignancy" should be "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". In the example, malignancy was "kyllä" because adenocarcinoma was found. Here, samples 1 and 2 are benign, sample 3 has some features but no confirmed malignancy. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, but sample 3's status is unclear. If the worst lesion is in sample 3, but it's not confirmed as malignant, then maybe "ei"? Or "NA"? Wait, the user instructions say to report the worst lesion. If sample 3's findings are ambiguous, but there's no confirmed malignancy, then perhaps "ei"? But the text mentions "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) and "immunologinen aktiviteetti on erittäin ilmeistä" (immunological activity is very evident), which might be reactive or inflammatory. The key is whether malignant cells are present. Since samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed, perhaps the answer is "ei". But wait, the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, there's no mention of cancer, just suspicious features. So "ei" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason**: For malignant cases, report as "major+minor=sum". If benign, "NA". Since in this case, malignancy is "ei", then Gleason would be "NA". However, the text mentions that in sample 3, the highest Gleason grade is missing, with a question mark in major and minor. There's a lower grade covering 10%, but the value is missing. So even if there was a suspicion, since the Gleason isn't reported, and malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The samples are numbered, but the type isn't specified. The third sample is the largest part of the prostate tissue, processed routinely. Without explicit mention, "NA".

Malignancy: Samples 1 and 2 are free, sample 3 has ambiguous findings but no confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

Gleason: Since malignancy is "ei", "NA".

Wait, but the text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin; ilmeisesti matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä, mutta itse graden arvo puuttuu, mahdollisesti kirjausvirhe." So they tried to assign Gleason but there's a clerical error. Does that imply that there was a malignancy but the grade is missing? If so, then malignancy would be "kyllä", and Gleason "NA". But the user instructions say Gleason is "NA" for benign. So if malignancy is "kyllä" but Gleason is missing, then Gleason is "NA". But how to determine malignancy in that case.

The key is whether the presence of malignancy is confirmed. The text says samples 1 and 2 are free. Sample 3: "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), "histologiset ominaisuudet havainnoillistavat vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (histological features demonstrate varying growth patterns), "immunologinen aktiviteetti on erittäin ilmeistä ja normaaleja tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia epäillään" (immunological activity is very evident and normal inflammatory changes are suspected). There's a mention of PIN changes, which are pre-malignant. The Gleason is missing due to possible clerical error. So the pathologist might suspect something but couldn't confirm. In such cases, if there's no definite malignancy reported, then "Malignancy" should be "ei". However, if there's a mention of a Gleason grade attempt (even with missing values), does that imply malignancy? For example, if they tried to assign Gleason but couldn't, that might indicate malignancy but incomplete reporting. But the user instructions say to report "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. If the Gleason is missing but there's a lesion, it's ambiguous. However, in the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma confirmed malignancy. Here, there's no such confirmation. So perhaps "Malignancy" is "ei", leading to Gleason "NA".

But another angle: the presence of Gleason grading attempt (even with missing values) might imply that malignancy was present, but the grade couldn't be determined. In that case, malignancy would be "kyllä", and Gleason "NA". However, the user instructions for Gleason say to use "NA" for benign cases. If malignancy is "kyllä", but Gleason is missing, then Gleason is "NA". But how to decide malignancy here.

The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for samples 1 and 2, but sample 3's status is unclear. The mention of Gleason with missing values might suggest that there was an attempt to grade, implying malignancy. However, the pathologist might have intended to grade but couldn't due to error. If the presence of malignancy is confirmed, then "kyllä", else "ei". Since the text doesn't explicitly state malignancy in sample 3, but mentions suspicious features and a missing Gleason, it's ambiguous. However, in medical reporting, if a Gleason is attempted, even with missing parts, it's usually because malignancy is present. But in this case, the Gleason is completely missing (major and minor are question marks), and the grade value is missing. So it's possible that the sample was considered malignant but the grading was incomplete. Alternatively, the suspicious features might not be malignant. This is a tricky part.

Given the user instructions to take the worst lesion, and if the worst lesion is in sample 3, which has ambiguous findings but no confirmed malignancy, then perhaps "Malignancy" is "ei". However, if the attempt to assign Gleason (even with errors) implies malignancy, then "kyllä". But without explicit confirmation, it's safer to go with "ei" if the report doesn't state malignancy. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, but for sample 3, it's not stated. So the worst case is sample 3, which is not confirmed as malignant. Therefore, "Malignancy" is "ei", Gleason "NA".

Sampletype: Since the samples are numbered and the third is the largest part of the prostate, but the type isn't specified, "NA".

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
