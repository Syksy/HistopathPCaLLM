Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the samples are referred to as "näytteet" which translates to samples. The report mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but in the current case, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The text mentions "Prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and "ajetaan normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti" which might indicate a routine procedure. However, the exact type isn't clear. The example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. Here, since it's about numbered samples and mentions "biopsiasta" isn't present, but the samples are likely biopsies. However, the third sample is processed routinely. Wait, maybe the samples are from different procedures. The first two samples have non-primary tissue, and the third has the largest part of the prostate tissue. But the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The user might default to NA if not specified. But in the example, even though it's numbered, they used biopsy. Hmm. Let me check again. The original example had "Prostata biopsiasta" leading to "biopsy". Here, the samples are numbered, but the procedure isn't explicitly stated. The user might need to infer. Since the samples are numbered and the third is the largest part of the prostate tissue, maybe it's a TURP or RP? But the text doesn't specify. The first two samples have non-primary tissue. The third is the main part. But without clear terms like "leikkaus" (surgery) or "TURP", maybe it's safer to put NA.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita." So samples 1 and 2 are free of malignancy. Sample 3: "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (varying growth patterns), and mentions "immunologinen aktiviteetti" and "tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia" (inflammatory changes). But the highest Gleason grade is missing, with a question mark. Also, "matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä, mutta itse graden arvo puuttuu" (lower grade covered 10%, but the grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error). There's suspicion of PIN changes. However, samples 1 and 2 are benign, but sample 3's malignancy isn't clearly stated. The key is whether any sample has malignancy. The user instruction says to report the worst lesion. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, but sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia" features but no confirmed malignancy. The Gleason is missing due to possible error. The question is, does sample 3 have malignancy? The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, but sample 3's status isn't explicitly stated. The mention of "PIN-muutoksista" (PIN changes) is a premalignant condition. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy in sample 3, but the Gleason is missing, maybe the malignancy is "ei" (no)? But wait, the example had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, if there's no confirmed malignancy, maybe "ei". But the text says "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" which could be suspicious but not confirmed. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion. If there's no confirmed malignancy, then "ei". But the presence of PIN might not count as malignancy. So malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin; ... itse graden arvo puuttuu, mahdollisesti kirjausvirhe." So the Gleason grades are missing, marked as ?. Since there's no malignancy (assuming malignancy is "ei"), then Gleason should be "NA". But if malignancy were "kyllä", then Gleason would be required. But since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The original sample type isn't specified. The example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was mentioned. Here, the samples are numbered, but the procedure isn't stated. So maybe NA. But wait, the third sample is "suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta" (the largest part of the prostate tissue under examination). Could this be a TURP or RP? Without explicit terms, maybe NA. Alternatively, if the samples are biopsies, but the text doesn't say "biopsia". The example used "biopsy" when "biopsiasta" was in the text. Here, the samples are numbered, but the procedure isn't mentioned. So Sampletype: NA.

Malignancy: Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive with no confirmed malignancy, the answer is "ei".

Gleason: Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
