Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says the epithelial cells appear normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to processing issues. It also states conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy. So Malignancy would be "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy found, but wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report is inconclusive due to processing issues, maybe it's safer to put "no" since they didn't find any malignancy, but the answer could be tricky. However, the key point is whether malignant findings were present. Since the report says "appears rather normal" and no mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor, Malignancy should be "no".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. So even if there's a mention of some structural issues, without malignancy, Gleason isn't applicable.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the text again. No specific sample type mentioned, no malignancy detected, so the answer should be correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
