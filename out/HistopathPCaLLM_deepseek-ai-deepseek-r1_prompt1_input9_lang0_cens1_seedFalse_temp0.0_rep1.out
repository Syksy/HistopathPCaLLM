Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says the epithelial cell lining appears normal, and while there are some disproportionate glandular structures, they attribute that to technical difficulties. The conclusion is that they can't draw conclusions due to suspected faulty processing. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected, and the findings are inconclusive, Malignancy should be NA. Wait, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the processing was faulty and they can't conclude, does that mean it's NA? Because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed or denied. So yes, Malignancy is NA here.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum". The statement doesn't mention any Gleason grades. Since there's no malignancy reported, Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some abnormalities, without explicit mention of Gleason scores, it's NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the results are inconclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it. The structured JSON should reflect these NAs.
