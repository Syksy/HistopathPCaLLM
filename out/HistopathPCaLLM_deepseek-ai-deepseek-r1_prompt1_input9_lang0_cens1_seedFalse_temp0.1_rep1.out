Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So I think Sampletype should be NA here because there's no explicit mention of the sample type.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says the epithelial cells appear normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to technical issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and there's a suspicion of faulty processing. Since there's no mention of cancer or malignancy detected, and the findings are inconclusive, Malignancy should be "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy found. Wait, but "no" would mean they checked and found no malignancy. However, the text says conclusions can't be drawn. Hmm, maybe "NA" is better here because the results are inconclusive. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the processing was faulty and they can't conclude, maybe Malignancy is NA. But the user instructions say to return "no" for benign. The text says "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" which might suggest no malignancy. But the conclusion is uncertain. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the example again. In the example, when adenocarcinoma is present, it's yes. If the sample is benign, then no. Here, since the findings are normal but inconclusive due to processing issues, maybe Malignancy is "no" because they didn't find any malignant tumors, even though the processing was faulty. Alternatively, maybe NA because the results are inconclusive. The user instructions say "NA" if it's not applicable. Since the processing issues might have affected the results, but the observed tissue appears normal, perhaps the answer is "no" because there's no mention of malignancy. But I need to be careful. The key is whether malignant tumor findings were present. The text doesn't mention any malignancy, so maybe "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" for a malignant case. Since in this case, there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "no" because no tumors found, and Gleason is NA.
