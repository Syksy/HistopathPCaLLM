Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says the epithelial cells appear normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to processing issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and faulty processing is suspected. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected, and the findings are inconclusive, Malignancy should be NA. They didn't find any cancer, but they also can't confirm because of processing issues. So maybe "no"? Wait, but the instructions say to report the most severe lesion. If there's no mention of malignancy, but the processing was faulty, maybe it's unclear. The answer should be "no" if benign, "yes" if malignant, or NA if unknown. Since the conclusion is inconclusive, maybe NA is safer here. Wait, the text says "appears rather normal" and attributes issues to technical difficulties. So maybe Malignancy is "no"? But the conclusion can't be drawn. Hmm. The user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. If there's no evidence of malignancy, then "no". But if it's inconclusive, maybe NA. The example given in the instructions for a benign case would have Malignancy as "no". Since the epithelial cells are normal and no malignancy is mentioned, even though the processing was faulty, the answer here is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" for a malignant case. Since in this case, Malignancy is "no", the Gleason should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason grading here, which aligns with the conclusion that there's no malignancy.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. No malignancy found, so "no". Gleason isn't applicable here. That seems right.
