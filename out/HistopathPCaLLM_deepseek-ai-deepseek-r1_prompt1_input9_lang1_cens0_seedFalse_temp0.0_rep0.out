Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Elektrosektio might refer to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Biopsy is usually when they take a small sample, RP is radical prostatectomy, which is a surgery to remove the entire prostate. TURP is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate, often for benign enlargement. So "elektrosektiolastuja" likely corresponds to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin, joten löydös sopii hyvänlaatuiseen liikakasvuun." That translates to no malignancy found, so Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the instructions say to use "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because it's benign. So Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, that's straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype: TURP. Malignancy: ei. Gleason: NA. All the required fields are covered, and the values are within the allowed options. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7", so the structure here should follow that format but with the appropriate values. Everything seems to check out.
