Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each one carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. I recall that TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed, often for benign enlargement. "Elektrosektio" might refer to a resection, so TURP seems likely here. Biopsy would be if it's a needle biopsy, but this doesn't sound like that. RP is radical prostatectomy, which is a surgery to remove the entire prostate, but the sample here is "lastuja" (chips), typical of TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin, joten löydös sopii hyvänlaatuiseen liikakasvuun." That translates to no malignancy found, so the answer here is "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the allowed value is "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because it's benign. So Gleason is "NA".

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. Malignancy is clearly "ei" as stated. Gleason is NA because it's benign. All the required fields are covered, and the JSON structure should be flat without nesting. The example provided also shows that when malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Everything seems to fit.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
