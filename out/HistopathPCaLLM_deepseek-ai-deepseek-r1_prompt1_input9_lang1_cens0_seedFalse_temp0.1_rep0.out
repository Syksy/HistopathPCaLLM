Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "no malignancy is present". So the malignancy field should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so it's straightforward. The JSON should follow the example given, using the specified keys and allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
