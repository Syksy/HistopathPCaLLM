Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided example and the instructions carefully to make sure I understand what's needed.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, which was translated to "biopsy". Looking at the current case: the sample is described as "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". Hmm, "elektrosektio" probably refers to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), since that's a common procedure where tissue is removed using an electric loop. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "no malignancy is found". So the malignancy field should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, this should be "NA".

Let me double-check each part. The sample type: TURP is correct because elektrosektio is a type of TURP. Malignancy is correctly "ei" because the report explicitly says no malignancy. Gleason is NA because there's no cancer detected. The example provided also used NA for non-malignant cases. So the JSON should have "TURP", "ei", and "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
