Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided example and the instructions again to make sure I understand the requirements.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, which was translated from "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: the sample is "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I need to figure out what that corresponds to. Elektrosektio might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate. So TURP would be the sample type here.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "No malignancy is present". So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example showed that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. So even if there were some numbers mentioned, since malignancy is 'no', it's NA.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type: elektrosektiolastuja is indeed TURP. Malignancy is clearly stated as none. Gleason is not applicable here. So the JSON should have Sampletype as "TURP", Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
