Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of the prostate and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) and talks about processing it in steps, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The term "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) is present, but the original procedure isn't specified. So, I think the sample type here is "NA" because it's not clear from the context.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions that the epithelial border appears normal and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. However, there's a note about some gland structures being disproportionately large, possibly due to technical issues. The conclusion states that no definitive conclusions can be drawn, and faulty sample handling is suspected. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but also no explicit statement that it's benign, I might lean towards "ei" (no) because if there were malignancy, it would likely be mentioned. But wait, the absence of malignancy isn't confirmed either. The report says they can't draw conclusions, so maybe "NA" is safer here. Hmm, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample processing was faulty, maybe they couldn't determine it. So "NA" might be appropriate for malignancy as well.

Lastly, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since there's no mention of Gleason scores in the report and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the report is inconclusive due to possible technical issues. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it and malignancy isn't confirmed.
