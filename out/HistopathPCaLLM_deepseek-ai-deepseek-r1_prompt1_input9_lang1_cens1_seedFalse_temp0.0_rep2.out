Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" which translates to sample material. The text doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just talks about processing the material in steps. So there's no clear indication of the sample type. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that there are "suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue) and "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (the border of epithelial tissue appears normal). Some parts mention disproportionate gland structures, but that's attributed to technical handling issues. Importantly, it says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions cannot be drawn with certainty) and suspects faulty sample handling. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no) because there's no evidence of malignancy reported, but wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and attributes abnormalities to technical issues, "ei" seems correct.

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is ei because no cancer found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
