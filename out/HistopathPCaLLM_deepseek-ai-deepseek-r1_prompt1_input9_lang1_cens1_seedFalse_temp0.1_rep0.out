Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin..." The mention of "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) and the process of handling it in steps suggests it's a biopsy. But wait, RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. The text doesn't mention surgery terms like prostatectomy or TURP. It talks about sample material being processed in steps, which might be a biopsy. However, the user might consider if the amount (dozens of grams) is more typical for TURP or RP. Biopsies are usually smaller. Hmm, but the text says "noin puolet käsiteltiin" (about half was processed), and the other half discarded. That could happen in a larger sample. But without explicit terms like TURP or RP, maybe it's safer to put NA here. Wait, the example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, just "näytemateriaalia". So maybe Sampletype is NA because it's unclear. But the user might expect "biopsy" if it's a sample taken via biopsy. But the text doesn't specify. Hmm. Let me check again. The original sample type isn't clearly stated. The report just mentions sample material obtained. So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Second, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (epithelial tissue border seems normal), "rauhasrakenteet suhteettoman kokoisilta" (gland structures disproportionately sized), but no mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or malignancy. Also, "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions can't be drawn with certainty) and suspected faulty sample handling. So there's no clear indication of malignancy. Since they can't draw conclusions, maybe Malignancy is NA. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" (Were there malignant findings in the sample?). If no malignancy is detected and the sample is inconclusive, but no positive findings, then maybe "ei". But the report doesn't explicitly say negative, just that they can't conclude. So perhaps Malignancy is NA here.

Third, Gleason. Since there's no mention of cancer, Gleason would be NA. The example had Gleason when malignancy was present. Here, if malignancy is NA or ei, then Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear (NA), Malignancy is NA because results are inconclusive, and Gleason is NA. But wait, maybe Sampletype is biopsy? The example used biopsy when the text mentioned biopsy. Here, the sample is just "näytemateriaalia", which could be a biopsy. But without explicit mention, maybe NA is safer. Alternatively, if the user expects that any sample not specified as RP or TURP is considered biopsy, but that's a stretch. The instructions say to use the allowed values. If the sample type isn't clearly one of the three, then NA. So Sampletype: NA. Malignancy: NA (since no conclusion can be drawn). Gleason: NA.
