Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia saatiin" which translates to "sample material was obtained." However, there's no specific mention of the type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about processing the material in steps and some being discarded, but it doesn't specify the original sample type. So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states that there are "suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue) and mentions "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (the border of epithelial tissue appears normal). Some gland structures are disproportionately sized, possibly due to technical issues. Importantly, it says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions cannot be drawn with certainty) and suspects faulty sample handling. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" since no malignant findings are reported, but wait—the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the sample is inconclusive due to handling issues, does that mean malignancy is NA? Hmm. The instructions say if there are no malignant findings, use "ei". Since the report doesn't indicate any malignancy detected, even if inconclusive, maybe "ei" is correct. But the uncertainty is due to technical issues. However, the key point is whether malignant findings were present. Since none are mentioned, "ei" seems appropriate.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some mention, but in this case, there's no mention of Gleason grades. So definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy.
