Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia" which translates to sample material. However, there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The text talks about processing the sample in steps and issues with handling, but the original sample type isn't specified. So, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that there are large amounts of prostate tissue, the epithelial border appears normal, and some gland structures are disproportionately sized, possibly due to technical handling issues. Importantly, it mentions that conclusions can't be drawn with certainty and suspects faulty sample processing. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report is inconclusive, the safest answer here is "ei" (no), but wait, maybe "NA"? Wait, the question says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If there's no mention of malignancy, and the report is inconclusive, perhaps "ei" is correct if they didn't find any, but if it's uncertain, maybe "NA". Hmm. The example given in the instructions had a clear malignancy. Here, since they can't draw conclusions and suspect handling issues, but no malignancy is reported, maybe "ei" is appropriate. But the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no mention of malignancy, then "ei". However, if the report is inconclusive, maybe "NA". The text says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions can't be drawn with certainty), so maybe it's unclear. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they didn't find any, but the sample processing was faulty, perhaps the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was detected, even though the sample might be inadequate. Alternatively, if the sample was inadequate, maybe "NA". The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, since there's no mention of cancer, and the sample is problematic, the answer is "ei".

For Gleason score, the value should be "NA" if there's no malignancy. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (no malignant findings reported)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
