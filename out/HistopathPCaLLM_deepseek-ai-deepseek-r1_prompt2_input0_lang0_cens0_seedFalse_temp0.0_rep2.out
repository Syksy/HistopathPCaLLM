Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "samples" is mentioned, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The procedure described seems like a general sampling, maybe from a surgery, but without clear terms. So I might have to put NA here unless there's a hint. Wait, the example given for a biopsy uses the word "biopsy" in the statement. Here, the text says "benign prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So Malignancy is definitely "no". The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's clearly stated as no malignancy, that's straightforward.

Third, Gleason grade. The Gleason score is only reported if there's a malignancy. Since the text says there are no malignancies, the Gleason should be NA. The example also shows that if malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the text is benign, there's no severe lesion, so all fields should reflect that.
