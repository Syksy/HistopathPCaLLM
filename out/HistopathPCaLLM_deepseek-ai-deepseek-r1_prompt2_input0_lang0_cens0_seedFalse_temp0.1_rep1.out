Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." Hmm, the term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. The example given used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So Malignancy is definitely "no."

For Gleason grade, since the findings are benign and there's no mention of cancer, the Gleason score isn't applicable. So that's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. The example provided uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that format.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
