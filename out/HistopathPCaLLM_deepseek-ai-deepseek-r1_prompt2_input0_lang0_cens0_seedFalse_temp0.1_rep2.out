Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g..." The term "chipping samples" isn't one of the allowed values. The examples given in the instructions use terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the text doesn't mention any of these specific procedures, the Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text explicitly states "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So the Malignancy field should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported here. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy at all. So the final answer should reflect that.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
