Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the type of sample. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA because the report is inconclusive, not confirming presence or absence.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows that if there's a Gleason score mentioned, it should be in the format "major+minor=sum". The given text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no mention of Gleason, this should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention. I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the input text again to confirm there's no mention of sample type specifics or malignancy findings. Yep, looks like all three fields should be NA.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
