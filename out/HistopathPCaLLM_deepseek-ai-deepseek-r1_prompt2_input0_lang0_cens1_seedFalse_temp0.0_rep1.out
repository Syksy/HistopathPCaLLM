Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the type of sample. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. It doesn't confirm the presence or absence, just that it can't be concluded. So Malignancy should be "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy couldn't be determined, there's no Gleason grade reported. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Hence, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA".
