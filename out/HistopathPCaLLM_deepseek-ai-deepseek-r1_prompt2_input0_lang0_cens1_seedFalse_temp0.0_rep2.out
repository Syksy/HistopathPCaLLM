Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So they couldn't determine malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the test couldn't confirm or deny, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the example shows that if there's no malignancy, it's NA. Since malignancy is NA here, Gleason is automatically NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which reinforces that.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported and no scores mentioned. The example given for an inconclusive case also uses NA for all fields, so this fits.
