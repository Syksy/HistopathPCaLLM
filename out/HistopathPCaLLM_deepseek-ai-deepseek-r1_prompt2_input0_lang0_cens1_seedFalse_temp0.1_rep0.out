Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the type of sample. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report states that malignancy can't be inferred, the answer here is "no" because there's no evidence of malignancy, but wait—the allowed values include "NA" as well. Wait, the instructions say for Malignancy: "yes", "no", or "NA". If the text explicitly says they can't determine malignancy, maybe "NA" is more appropriate. But the example given in the problem where malignancy couldn't be conducted was mapped to "NA". Wait, in the example where the statement was invalid, all fields were NA. But in the first example, when malignancy was present, it was "yes". Here, the text says they can't infer malignancy, so maybe "no" isn't correct. Wait, the text says "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted." So it's not that they found no malignancy, but that they couldn't assess it. Therefore, the correct value here would be "NA" because the presence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Wait, but the allowed values for Malignancy are yes, no, or NA. The user's instructions say: "Malignancy: allowed values 'yes', 'no', or 'NA'". So if the report says they can't determine it, then it's NA. If they checked and found no malignancy, it's 'no'. Here, the text states that "any inference of... malignancy... cannot be conducted," meaning they couldn't assess it. So Malignancy should be NA.

Third, the Gleason grade. The text doesn't mention anything about Gleason scores or grades. Since there's no mention, and the malignancy is NA (or possibly no), the Gleason should be NA. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because they couldn't assess it. Gleason is NA because there's no mention. So the JSON should have all three fields as NA.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
