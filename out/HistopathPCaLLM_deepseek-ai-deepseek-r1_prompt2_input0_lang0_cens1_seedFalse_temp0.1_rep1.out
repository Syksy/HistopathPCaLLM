Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type should be NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This indicates that they couldn't determine malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report states that malignancy can't be assessed, the answer here is NA.

For the Gleason grade, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Since malignancy couldn't be determined and there's no mention of Gleason, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't determinable, and no Gleason grade is provided.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
