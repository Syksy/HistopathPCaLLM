Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided text: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed..." The text mentions "sample material" and "histological examination," but it doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type should be NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This means they couldn't determine malignancy, so it's not confirmed as yes or no. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as NA. I need to ensure there's no nesting and that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions. The example given for an inconclusive statement also results in all NAs, which matches this scenario.
