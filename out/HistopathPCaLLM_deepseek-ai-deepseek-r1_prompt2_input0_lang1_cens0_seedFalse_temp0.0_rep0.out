Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g..." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to something like "shavings" or "chips," which is typical in a TURP procedure. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." This translates to benign prostate tissue without atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma. So the malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, the report mentions no malignancy or carcinoma, so there's no Gleason grading needed. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results, which in this case are all benign. The example provided by the user for a benign case also uses NA for Gleason, so that's correct here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
