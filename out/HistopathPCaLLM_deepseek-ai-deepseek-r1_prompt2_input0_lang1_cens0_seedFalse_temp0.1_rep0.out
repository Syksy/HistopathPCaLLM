Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to something like "shavings" or "chips", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. TURP specimens are typically chips or fragments, so I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Histologisessa tarkastelussa havaitaan hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." The key words here are "hyvänlaatuista" (benign), "ei malignia" (no malignancy), and "ei karsinoomaa" (no carcinoma). So, the answer here should be "ei" for Malignancy.

Lastly, the Gleason score. Since the report mentions no malignancy or carcinoma, there wouldn't be a Gleason score reported. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together, the structured data should be:
Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. In this case, since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The sample type is correctly identified as TURP based on the description of the sample. All fields are filled appropriately according to the allowed values.
