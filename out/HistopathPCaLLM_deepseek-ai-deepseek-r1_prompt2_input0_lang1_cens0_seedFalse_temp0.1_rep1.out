Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part based on the given example and instructions.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the text starts with "Höyläyslastuja..." which translates to something like "shavings" or "chips". I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often results in chip-like samples. So "höyläyslastuja" might indicate TURP. But wait, the Finnish term for TURP is "transuretraalinen prostataleikkaus", but sometimes in reports, they might refer to the sample type by the method. Since TURP involves cutting pieces of the prostate, and the sample here is described as "höyläyslastuja", which are shavings or chips, that's typical for TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy." So "hyvänlaatuinen" means benign, and they explicitly mention no malignancy or carcinoma. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the requirement is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA".

Let me double-check each part. The sample type: TURP is correct here because of the "höyläyslastuja" which are typical for TURP specimens. The malignancy is clearly stated as absent. And since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. All seems to fit the criteria. No nested structures, just the three fields with the specified values.
