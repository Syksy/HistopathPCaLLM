Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to parse a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The user provided examples and guidelines, so I need to follow those closely.

First, let's look at the input text: "Höyläyslastuja tuli yhteensä noin 30g, joista noin 20g käynnistettiin kuudessa blokissa. Histologisessa tarkastelussa havaitaan hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta, missä ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy. Vähän nähtävissä läiskittäistä tulehdusta. Löydös sopii siis epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan."

Starting with Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the term used is "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often results in chip specimens, so maybe this is a TURP sample. Alternatively, "höyläys" might refer to a different procedure. Let me check. In Finnish medical terms, "höyläys" can sometimes refer to a type of biopsy, but TURP is a common procedure that produces such samples. The example given for biopsy used "biopsiasta", so if the text here doesn't mention biopsy but refers to "höyläyslastuja", which are TURP chips, then Sampletype should be "TURP". So I think Sampletype here is TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text states "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta" (benign prostate tissue) and "ei atypiaa, malignia, tai karsinoomaa näy" (no atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma seen). So the answer here is "ei".

Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since the report says there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Let me cross-check with the examples. The first example had a biopsy sample with malignancy and a Gleason score. The second example was a nonsensical text, so all NA. Here, the sample type is TURP because of the "höyläyslastuja", which aligns with TURP procedure. Malignancy is clearly negative. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I think that's correct. Let me make sure there's no mention of any Gleason score here. The text doesn't mention any cancer, so no Gleason. Sampletype is TURP because of the chips from resection. Yes, that makes sense.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
