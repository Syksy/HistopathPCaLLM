Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." The key terms here might indicate the sample type. However, the text doesn't mention specific procedures like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The mention of "näytemateriaalia" (sample material) is vague. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I should default to NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states: "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to not being able to determine malignancy or carcinoma. Also, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä..." means no conclusion can be drawn. So, since malignancy isn't confirmed, and they can't make a determination, the answer here should be NA, not "ei" because "ei" would mean they confirmed no malignancy, which isn't the case here.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. However, since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy and no scores mentioned. The example provided in the problem where malignancy couldn't be determined also used NA for all fields, which aligns with this case.
