Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of them one by one based on the provided text.

First, the sample type. The original text is in Finnish, so I need to look for keywords indicating the type of sample. The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text says "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä. Histologisessa tarkastelussa havaitaan prostatakudosta..." which translates to a lot of sample material, processed in several batches, and mentions prostate tissue. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample type isn't specified here, so according to the instructions, if it's not clear, we should put "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text states "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä" which means that conclusions about malignancy or carcinoma cannot be made. Additionally, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan" translates to the material can't be concluded to fit a benign hyperplasia. Since they can't determine malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no evidence of malignancy, but wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". However, the example where malignancy couldn't be determined used "NA". Wait, in the example given by the user, when the text was nonsensical, all fields were NA. But in this case, the report says they can't make a conclusion about malignancy. So maybe "ei" if there's no mention of malignancy, but the text says they can't determine it. Hmm. Let me check the instructions again. The second field is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report explicitly says no malignancy found, then "ei". If it's uncertain or can't be determined, maybe "NA". The text here says "ei voida tehdä" (cannot be made), so it's inconclusive. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed or denied; it's just that they can't conclude. So "Malignancy" would be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. Since there's no mention of malignancy (and malignancy is "NA"), the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given had Gleason as "NA" when malignancy wasn't present or couldn't be determined.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it and malignancy isn't confirmed.
