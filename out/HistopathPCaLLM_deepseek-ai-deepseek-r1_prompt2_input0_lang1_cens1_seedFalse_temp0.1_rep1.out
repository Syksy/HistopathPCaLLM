Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä. Histologisessa tarkastelussa havaitaan prostatakudosta..." The key term here is "näytemateriaalia", which translates to sample material. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The mention of "prostatakudosta" (prostate tissue) is general. Since there's no specific procedure named, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states: "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä" which translates to "conclusions about cellular atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be made". Additionally, "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä..." means they can't conclude if it's benign hyperplasia. Since malignancy isn't confirmed or denied, the answer here is "NA".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, there's no Gleason reported. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so this should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
