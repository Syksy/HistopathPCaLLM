Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytemateriaalia tuli yhteensä runsaasti, josta suurin osa käynnistettiin useammassa erässä." The key term here is "näytemateriaalia" which translates to sample material. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The report just says there was a lot of material processed in several batches. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, the answer here should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states: "päättelyä solujen atypiasta, maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä." This translates to "conclusions about cellular atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be made." Additionally, it says "Materiaalista ei voida vetää johtopäätöstä sopisiko se pelkästään epäiltyyn hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan." So they can't determine if it's benign hyperplasia or not. Since malignancy can't be confirmed or denied, the answer here is NA, not "ei" because "ei" would mean definitely no malignancy, which isn't the case here.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores. There's no reference to grades like 3, 4, or 5. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it and malignancy isn't confirmed.
