Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." and refers to "prostate tissue material." However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "samples" is too generic, so I can't confidently assign it to any of the allowed categories. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "normal basal cells were observed," which is a normal finding. It also talks about "suspicious formations" and "Suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing," but there's no explicit mention of malignancy or cancer. Since there's no confirmation of malignant tumors, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. The discussion is more about the staining process and sample logistics, not tumor grading. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the text doesn't provide clear information on sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar to this case where the text is more about procedural issues rather than diagnostic findings.
