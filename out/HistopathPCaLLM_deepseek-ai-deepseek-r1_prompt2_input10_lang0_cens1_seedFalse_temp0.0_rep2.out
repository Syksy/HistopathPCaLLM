Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." and refers to "prostate tissue material." However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about samples in batches and immunological stainings but doesn't specify the procedure type. So, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "normal basal cells were observed," which is a benign finding. It also talks about "suspicious formations" and "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing," but there's no confirmation of malignancy. The conclusion doesn't state the presence of cancer, only that the staining panel might have issues. So, Malignancy should be no because there's no confirmed malignancy, just suspicion which isn't enough for a "yes."

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the Gleason grade should be NA. The example given shows that if malignancy is no or NA, Gleason is NA. The text here doesn't reference any Gleason scores or grades, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is no because there's no confirmed cancer, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy reported. The answer should be a JSON object with these values.
