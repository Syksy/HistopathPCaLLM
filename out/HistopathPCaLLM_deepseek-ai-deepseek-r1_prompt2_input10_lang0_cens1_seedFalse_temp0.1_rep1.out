Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." but doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement talks about "normal basal cells" and mentions "suspicious formations" but concludes with "Suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing in some samples." There's no explicit mention of malignancy, cancer, adenocarcinoma, or tumor. The suspicious formations relate to staining issues, not confirmed malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason grade is only reported for malignant cases, this should be NA as well.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA. The example provided for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the text discusses sample logistics and staining issues without confirming any malignancy or providing Gleason scores.
