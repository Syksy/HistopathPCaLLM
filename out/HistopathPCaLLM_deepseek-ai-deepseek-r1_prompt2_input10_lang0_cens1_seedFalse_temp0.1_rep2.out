Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given text about prostate cancer histopathology. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first part mentions "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." and later refers to "prostate tissue material." However, there's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The text talks about samples in batches and immunological stainings but doesn't specify the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal basal cells were observed," which is a benign finding. There's a "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing in some samples," but no mention of actual malignant tumors. The conclusion talks about suspicion related to stainings failing, not malignancy. So Malignancy should be no, since there's no confirmation of cancer, just some staining issues.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows that if there's a malignancy, it should be in the format "major+minor=sum." Since there's no malignancy reported here, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no mention of any lesions, just normal cells and staining issues, the answers remain NA and no appropriately.
