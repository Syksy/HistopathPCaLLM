Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteinä 8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita tyyppipaikoista..." The key word here is "systeemibiopsioita," which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA." The report states "varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" (a definite cancer diagnosis cannot be made) and "benigniin päin" (leaning towards benign). So there's no confirmed malignancy. However, there's a "Suspicio-löydös" (suspicious finding), but since it's uncertain and leans benign, the malignancy answer should be "ei" (no). Wait, but the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If there's a suspicious finding but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? Hmm. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, since the diagnosis is uncertain and leans benign, maybe "ei" is correct. The example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. Here, the conclusion is that it's benign, so malignancy is "ei."

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is "ei," Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports this.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
