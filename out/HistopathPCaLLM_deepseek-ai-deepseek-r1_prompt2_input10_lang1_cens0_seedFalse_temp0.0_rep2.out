Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate samples and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me start by reading the input text carefully.

The sample is described as "8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita tyyppipaikoista". The term "systeemibiopsioita" clearly refers to biopsies, so the Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward for the first field.

Next, determining malignancy. The report mentions "epäilty fokus on häviävän pieni ja varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" and "Johtopäätös: Suspicio-löydös biopsioista, mutta diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin." So, they suspect something but can't confirm malignancy. The conclusion leans towards benign. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since there's no confirmed malignancy, but it's suspicious, but the final diagnosis is uncertain and benign, maybe "ei" (no) isn't right. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? The example given in the problem had a clear adenocarcinoma, so "kyllä". Here, since it's not confirmed and benign is suggested, maybe "ei"? But the user's instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. However, the text says "varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" and "benigniin päin". So no definitive malignancy. Therefore, "ei" for malignancy.

For Gleason score, since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades because the diagnosis isn't confirmed. So even if there's a suspicion, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example where malignancy was present, Gleason was filled. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That aligns with the instructions.
