Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the sample text to understand what's needed.

First, the sample text given is in Finnish, so I need to parse that. The example shows that for a biopsy mentioning adenocarcinoma with Gleason 4+3=7, the JSON should have biopsy, kyllä, and 4+3=7. The other example, which is a nonsensical report, returns NA for all fields.

Now, looking at the actual input text: "Näytteinä 8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita tyyppipaikoista, yhteensä n. 120mm..." The key points here are:

1. Sampletype: The text mentions "systeemibiopsioita", which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type should be biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So "biopsy" is correct here.

2. Malignancy: The report states "benigniin päin" which means benign, and "diagnoosi epävarma" (diagnosis uncertain). However, it's a Suspicio-löydös (suspicious finding), but no definitive cancer diagnosis. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, but it's suspicious, but the conclusion leans benign. The question is whether to put "ei" or "NA". The example where malignancy wasn't confirmed used "kyllä" when cancer was present, and "NA" in the nonsensical case. Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, but the conclusion is benign, maybe "ei" (no) is appropriate. But wait, the instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the diagnosis is uncertain but leans benign, then maybe the answer is "ei". But the example where malignancy was present had a clear adenocarcinoma. Here, the report says "varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa" (definite cancer diagnosis cannot be made) and "benigniin päin" (towards benign). So the malignancy is not present, hence "ei".

3. Gleason: Since there's no malignancy confirmed, the Gleason should be "NA". The example where malignancy was present included the Gleason score, but if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports using NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA.
