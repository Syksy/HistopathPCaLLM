Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "systeemibiopsioita" which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states that a definite cancer diagnosis can't be made ("varmaa syöpädiagnoosia ei voida antaa") and the conclusion is "benigniin päin" which means leaning towards benign. So there are no malignant findings confirmed. Therefore, malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, just some suspicion but no confirmed cancer. So even if there's a mention of Suspicio-löydös, without confirmed malignancy, Gleason remains NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Since the diagnosis is uncertain but benign, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Sample type is biopsy. That fits the example where benign cases have NA for Gleason.
