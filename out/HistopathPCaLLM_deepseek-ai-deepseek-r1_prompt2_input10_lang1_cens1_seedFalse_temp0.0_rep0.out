Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." There's no specific mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about samples in batches but doesn't specify the type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states "alustavassa tutkinnassa normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means "preliminary examination detected normal basal tissue in the prostate tissue material." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The rest of the text discusses issues with immunohistochemical stains and panels but doesn't indicate malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3+4=7 or similar. The mention of "gg 4+3=7" in the example is not present here. The text here is more about staining issues and panel reliability, not tumor grading.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report a score for.
