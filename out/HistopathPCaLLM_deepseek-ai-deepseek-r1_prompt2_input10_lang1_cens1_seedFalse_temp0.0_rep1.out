Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input is a Finnish text, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means "normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignancy. The immunostaining panels showed some patterns but didn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no indication of malignant findings, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason scores. The text talks about experimental immunostaining panels and staining failures, but no Gleason grades. So all three fields are NA, ei, NA respectively.
