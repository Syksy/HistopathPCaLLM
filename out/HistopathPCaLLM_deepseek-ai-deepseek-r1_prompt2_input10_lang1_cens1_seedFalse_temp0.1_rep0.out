Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathological report on prostate samples and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, it mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means "normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The immunostaining panels showed some patterns but didn't confirm malignancy. The conclusion talks about suspicion of failed stainings but no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3+4=7 or similar. The mention of "gg 4+3=7" in the example is not present here. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is ei (no) because normal tissue was found, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy. The example given in the problem shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. Also, the sample type wasn't mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA there too.
