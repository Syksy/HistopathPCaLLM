Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me read through the provided example and the instructions again to make sure I understand what's needed.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, so I need to look for terms indicating the sample type. The input text mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä" which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches". There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means "normal basal tissue was observed in the prostate tissue material". There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The immunostaining panels showed patterns, but that's about the panel's functionality, not malignancy. So the malignancy should be "ei" (no), but wait, the example had "kyllä" when there was cancer. Here, since they found normal tissue and no mention of malignancy, maybe "ei". But wait, the example where malignancy was "kyllä" had "adenokarsinoomaa". Here, no such terms. So "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either. The immunostaining panels are discussed, but that's about the panel's reliability, not the cancer grade. So Gleason is "NA".

Wait, but let me double-check. The user said to consider only the worst lesion's results. But in this case, there's no mention of any malignancy. The initial examination found normal basal tissue. The immunostaining panels in the last two samples showed clear patterns, but that's confirming the panel works. The other samples had staining failures, but no mention of cancer. Conclusion mentions suspicion of failed stainings in some samples, but most showed expected patterns. So no malignancy detected. Hence, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA", sample type is "NA".

So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
