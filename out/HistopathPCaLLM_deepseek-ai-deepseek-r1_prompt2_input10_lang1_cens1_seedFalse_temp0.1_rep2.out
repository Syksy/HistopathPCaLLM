Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided example and the given input carefully.

First, the input text is in Finnish, so I need to make sure I understand the key terms. The sample report mentions "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä..." which translates to "The requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches..." So, the samples are prostate-related. 

For the first field, Sampletype, the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current input, the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). It just refers to "prostatanäytteet" (prostate samples) arriving in batches. There's no specific procedure named here. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, Malignancy: kyllä, ei, or NA. The report states "normaalia basaalisolukkoa havaittiin prostatasolukkomateriaalissa" which means normal basal tissue was found. There's mention of some patterns in the last two samples with the experimental panel, but it's about the panel's reliability, not malignancy. The conclusion talks about suspicion of staining failures but no mention of cancer. So no malignant findings are reported. But wait, the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since there's no mention of cancer, just normal tissue and staining issues, Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score is required only if malignancy is present. Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports this.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
