Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and "malignant focus." Both of these clearly indicate the presence of a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The statement says "Gleason grading 4+3." That's straightforward. The example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7," so I need to present it in that exact format. So Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example in the problem uses the most severe lesion's Gleason score, and in this case, there's only one mentioned: 4+3=7. The other findings like high-grade PIN are noted but not relevant for the Gleason score here. The margins being clean and other areas free of malignancy don't affect the most severe lesion's details.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON, so just a flat structure with the three keys. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no ambiguity. The sample type is definitely RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All other information like tumor size or percentage area isn't needed for these fields. 

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
