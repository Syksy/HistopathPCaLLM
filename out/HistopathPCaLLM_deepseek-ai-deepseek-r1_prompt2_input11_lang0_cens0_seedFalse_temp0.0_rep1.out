Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first line mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy typically refers to RP, so the sample type here should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and mentions a "malignant focus." Both of these clearly indicate malignancy, so the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The statement says "Gleason grading 4+3." So I need to present that as "4+3=7." Even though the sum isn't explicitly written, combining 4 and 3 gives 7, which is standard for Gleason scores. The presence of this grading in the context of a malignant tumor means we should report it here.

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example provided uses the highest Gleason score mentioned, and since there's only one mentioned here (4+3), that's the one to use. Other findings like high-grade PIN are noted but don't affect the Gleason score for the main tumor.

Finally, making sure the JSON is valid without nested structures. All three fields are straightforward here. No nested data needed. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as "RP," Malignancy as "yes," and Gleason as "4+3=7."

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
