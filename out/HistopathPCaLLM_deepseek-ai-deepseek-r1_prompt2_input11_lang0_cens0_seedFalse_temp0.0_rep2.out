Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." So prostatectomy refers to RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus". The presence of tumor tissue described as malignant clearly indicates malignancy is present. So the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report states "Gleason grading 4+3". So the Gleason should be "4+3=7". Even though the exact wording is "grading 4+3", the sum is 7, so combining them as per the example makes sense.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions a malignant focus with Gleason 4+3, and other areas like the basis and vehicles are free. So the most severe is the 4+3=7. High-grade PIN is noted but that's not a malignant tumor finding, so it doesn't affect the Gleason here.

No nested structures in the JSON. Check that all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. The example provided uses quotes around the values, so the JSON should follow that structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
