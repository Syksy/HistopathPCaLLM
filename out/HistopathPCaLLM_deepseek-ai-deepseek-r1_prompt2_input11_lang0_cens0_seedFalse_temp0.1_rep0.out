Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and "malignant focus." Both of these clearly indicate the presence of a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The statement says "Gleason grading 4+3." That's straightforward. The example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7," so I should format it exactly as mentioned. Even though the sum is 7, the user wants the format "4+3=7," so that's what I'll use. There's no mention of another Gleason score elsewhere, and the instructions specify to take the most severe lesion, which this seems to be.

I also need to check if there's any conflicting information. The text mentions "High-grade PIN" which is a precursor but not malignant, and the basis and margins are free. However, the main tumor is malignant, so that's the key point. The Gleason 4+3 is part of the malignant findings, so that's the one to report.

No nested structures allowed, so the JSON should be flat. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype: RP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+3=7. All valid. No NA needed here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
