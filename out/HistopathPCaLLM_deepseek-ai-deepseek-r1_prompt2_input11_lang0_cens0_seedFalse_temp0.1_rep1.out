Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with Sampletype. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP", or "NA". The text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", so the sample type here is likely RP. The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the correct value here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text states "invasive tumor tissue is observed" and "malignant focus", which clearly indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text explicitly mentions "Gleason grading 4+3". So the Gleason value is "4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), that's separate from the tumor's Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which in this case is the 4+3=7.

I also need to check if there's any ambiguity. The sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy (RP). Malignancy is confirmed. The Gleason score is directly stated. There's no conflicting information here. The other details like tumor size and location don't affect the required fields. So the structured JSON should reflect these three values accurately.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
