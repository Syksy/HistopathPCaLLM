Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." so that's a clue. Prostatectomy usually refers to RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus". So Malignancy is definitely "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example format is major+minor=sum. The text says "Gleason grading 4+3". So I need to format that as "4+3=7". Even though the sum isn't explicitly written, adding 4 and 3 gives 7. The example shows including the sum, so I should follow that structure.

Now, making sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions a Gleason 4+3, which is a sum of 7. There's also high-grade PIN, but that's not a tumor finding. The main focus is on the 4+3, which is the primary lesion here.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. No other conflicting information, so the JSON should reflect these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
