Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Microscopically prostate tissue is observed" and talks about parts of the prostate being inspected, but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The preparation part says "Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol," but that's too vague. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive." High-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is a precancerous condition, not malignancy itself. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor. The Gleason scores (4 and 3) are mentioned but couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was investigated. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. The statement says the fractions of Gleason scores 4 and 3 couldn't be reliably assessed. So even though they mention scores 4 and 3, the assessment is inconclusive. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the sample type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because there's no clear evidence of malignancy. Gleason is NA because the assessment wasn't reliable. The example given in the instructions also shows that if the statement isn't valid (like inconclusive or insufficient info), all fields are NA. This case seems similar because the evaluation was inconclusive and the Gleason couldn't be assessed properly.
