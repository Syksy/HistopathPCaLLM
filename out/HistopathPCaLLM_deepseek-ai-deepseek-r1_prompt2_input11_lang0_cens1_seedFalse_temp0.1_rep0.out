Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to check each part carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The original sample type can be biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol" and "Microscopically prostate tissue is observed." However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about parts of the prostate being inspected but doesn't specify the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that fractions of Gleason scores 4 and 3 couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was investigated. It also mentions the evaluation of high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is inconclusive. Since there's no mention of confirmed malignancy, just that they couldn't assess the Gleason scores properly and PIN is inconclusive, there's no clear evidence of malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA, not yes or no, because it's not confirmed either way.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The user prefers a format like "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the Gleason scores couldn't be reliably assessed (only 5% material), even though they mention scores 4 and 3, it's stated that they couldn't assess them. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because there's no confirmation of malignant findings, and Gleason is NA because the assessment wasn't reliable. The example given in the problem also shows that if the Gleason can't be assessed, it's NA even if numbers are mentioned. So the final JSON should have all NAs.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
