Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol" and "Microscopically prostate tissue is observed." However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about parts of the prostate being inspected, but that's about the examination, not the sample type. So, since the sample type isn't specified, I should put NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says that fractions of Gleason scores 4 and 3 couldn't be reliably assessed because only 5% of the material was investigated. It also mentions the evaluation of high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is inconclusive. High-grade PIN is a precursor but not malignant itself. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or confirmed malignancy, and the Gleason assessment is unreliable, the malignancy isn't confirmed. So, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it should be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise NA. The text mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but states they couldn't be reliably assessed. Since the assessment is inconclusive and malignancy isn't confirmed, even though there's a mention of possible scores, they aren't confirmed. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because there's no confirmation of cancer, and Gleason is NA because the scores couldn't be reliably assessed. The example given for an inconclusive case also uses NA for all fields, so this fits.
