Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti käynnistetään..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to a prostatectomy specimen. In medical terms, RP stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, it talks about "invasioivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue), which is clearly malignant. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the Gleason grade. The example given in the instructions uses "major+minor=sum". The report states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The correct format would be "4+3=7". There's no ambiguity here as it's directly mentioned.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions a Gleason 4+3, which is the primary and secondary patterns. There's no mention of other Gleason scores that are higher, so this is the worst one. Also, the malignancy is confirmed, so Gleason is applicable. No other conflicting information is present. The sample type is clearly RP from the prostatectomy term. All fields should be filled as per the findings.
