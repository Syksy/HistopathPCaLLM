Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, so RP would be the sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, there's "invasioivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example given uses "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". So the format should be "4+3=7". Even though the sum isn't explicitly stated, 4+3 is 7, so that's correct. Since there's malignancy, we include this. If there were no malignancy, it would be NA.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions high-grade PIN nearby, but that's not the primary malignancy. The main points are the invasive tumor with Gleason 4+3. The margins are clear, but that doesn't affect malignancy status. The sample type is definitely RP from prostatectomy. All criteria are met, so the JSON should reflect these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
