Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, so RP stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, there's "invasiivista kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So the malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". The text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". So the Gleason score here is 4+3=7. Since there's a malignancy, we report this. If there were no malignancy, it would be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions a malignant focus in apex and central part, and Gleason 4+3. There's also high-grade PIN, but that's not the worst finding. The worst is the Gleason 4+3=7. The margins are clean, but that doesn't affect the malignancy status here.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. No issues with other parts conflicting. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
