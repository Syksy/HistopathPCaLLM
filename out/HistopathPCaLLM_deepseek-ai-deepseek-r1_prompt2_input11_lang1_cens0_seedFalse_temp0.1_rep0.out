Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is a radical prostatectomy, so RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus. Also, there's mention of "invasiivista kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text explicitly states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4+3=7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions a malignant focus in apex and central part, but no other worse findings elsewhere. The Gleason 4+3 is the primary score here. High-grade PIN is a precursor but not malignant, so it doesn't affect the malignancy field. Margins are clear, but that's about margins, not the presence of malignancy.

No nested structures allowed, so straightforward key-value pairs. All fields are covered with the correct values. No need to include anything else. Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" definitely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen (RP), not biopsy or TURP. Malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is clearly stated. So the JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
