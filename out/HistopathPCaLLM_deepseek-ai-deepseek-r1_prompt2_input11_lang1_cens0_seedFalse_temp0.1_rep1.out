Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So RP is the correct sample type here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "maligni pesäke" which means malignant focus. There's also mention of "invasivaa kasvainsolukkoa" (invasive tumor tissue). So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the exact Gleason score mentioned, so I don't need to look for other possible scores. The other findings like high-grade PIN and clean margins don't affect the malignancy status here since there's already a confirmed malignant lesion.

Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to a radical prostatectomy, so RP is correct. The malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason is clearly stated. All fields should be filled appropriately without any NA values.
