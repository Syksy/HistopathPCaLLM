Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy in Finnish, so RP is the likely sample type here. The example given for RP in the instructions probably refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "maligni pesäke" which translates to malignant focus. Also, there's "invasoivaa kasvainsolukkoa" meaning invasive tumor tissue. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example shows "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason luokkaa 4+3". The sum would be 7, but the required format is "4+3=7". However, the original text doesn't explicitly write the sum. But according to the example, even if the sum isn't stated, we should calculate it. So here, 4+3=7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" for malignancies. Since malignancy is present here, and the Gleason is given as 4+3, even if the sum isn't written, we should format it as 4+3=7. The example given in the problem includes a sum even if the original text might not have it. So yes, "4+3=7" is correct.

Other points: The text mentions high-grade PIN, but that's not malignancy. Basiksessa and vesikkeleissä no malignancy, but the main tumor is present. Margins are clean, but that doesn't affect malignancy status. The sample type is definitely RP. So all three fields are clear.
