Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "Prostatabiopsioita" which translates to prostate biopsies. Wait, the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" as the sample type when the text mentions "biopsiasta". The current report says "prostatabiopsioita" which is plural, but the sample type should be "biopsy". So the Sampletype here is "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaksi" which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes). But wait, in the example, even if there's a Gleason score, if the malignancy is present, it's "kyllä". Here, the report talks about "Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista" with values 4 and 3, but there's a mention that only 5% of the material could be examined. However, the presence of adenocarcinoma indicates malignancy. Wait, the text in the current case says "adenokarsinoomaksi t3b" which is a malignant finding. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason score, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The current text says "arvot 4 ja 3", which would be 4+3=7. However, the report states that these couldn't be reliably examined because only 5% of the material was available. The instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results and if the malignancy is present but Gleason can't be determined, maybe it's NA? Wait, the example given in the problem had a clear Gleason score. But in this case, the report says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" (could not be reliably examined). So even though they mention 4 and 3, if it's not reliable, should we put NA? The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results) but if the examination wasn't reliable, maybe the Gleason isn't reported. However, the presence of 4+3 is mentioned, but the reliability is in question. The problem is, the user's instructions say to report the Gleason for malignant cases. But if the report says it's not reliable, perhaps we should put NA. Wait, the example in the problem had a clear Gleason. In the example where the text was nonsensical, all were NA. Here, the malignancy is present, but the Gleason might not be reliable. The user's instruction for Gleason is to report "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else NA. But if the Gleason is mentioned but considered unreliable, do we still report it? The example in the problem didn't have such a case. The current text says "Osia tavallisimmista Gleason pisteytyksen komponenteista tällaisessa tilanteessa, arvot 4 ja 3, ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan, sillä vain noin 5% koko materiaalista pystyttiin tutkimaan." So the components 4 and 3 are mentioned, but the examination wasn't reliable. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" should be reported. If the Gleason is mentioned but unreliable, should we still include it? The problem's example included the Gleason even if it's the worst. But here, the reliability is an issue. However, the user's instructions don't mention reliability; they just say to take the worst lesion's results. So maybe we should report 4+3=7. But the text says they couldn't examine it reliably. Hmm. The user's example had a clear case. In this case, the pathologist might have mentioned the Gleason components but couldn't confirm. The instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (reported Gleason grade). If it's reported in the text, even if uncertain, should we take it? The example in the problem didn't have uncertainty. The current text mentions the values 4 and 3, but the reliability is low. However, the user's instructions don't specify to check reliability, just to report the Gleason if malignant. So perhaps the answer is "4+3=7". But the text says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" which might mean that the Gleason isn't reliably determined. In that case, maybe the Gleason should be NA. But the example in the problem included the Gleason even if the text was a bit messy. Wait, the example given by the user had a clear statement. Here, the Gleason components are mentioned but the reliability is questioned. The user's instruction says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (what was the reported Gleason grade). So if it's reported in the text, even if unreliable, we should take it. So the answer would be "4+3=7". But the problem is that the report says they couldn't reliably examine it. However, the user's instructions don't mention reliability as a factor for excluding the Gleason. The key is whether the Gleason is mentioned in the report. Since the values 4 and 3 are mentioned, even if unreliable, the answer should be "4+3=7". But maybe the correct approach is to consider that if the report states that the Gleason couldn't be reliably assessed, then it's not reported, hence NA. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example again. In the example, the text clearly states the Gleason. In the second example, the text is nonsensical, so all are NA. Here, the text mentions the Gleason components but says they couldn't be reliably examined. So perhaps the Gleason is not reliably reported, hence NA. But the user's instruction says "raportoitu" (reported). If the pathologist wrote the values but says they are unreliable, is that considered reported? In medical reports, sometimes they mention tentative grades but note uncertainty. The user's instruction might expect us to extract the mentioned values regardless of reliability notes. So in this case, the answer would be "4+3=7". But I need to be careful. Let me re-read the user's instructions: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa...)". So if it's reported in the text, even with uncertainty, we take it. So the answer is "4+3=7". But the text says "ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan" which might mean that the Gleason isn't reliable, but the values are still mentioned. So perhaps the correct answer is "4+3=7". However, in some cases, if the report states that the Gleason couldn't be determined, then it's NA. Here, they mention the components but couldn't examine them reliably. It's a bit of a gray area. But according to the user's example, even if the text is messy but contains the Gleason, it's taken. So here, since 4 and 3 are mentioned, even with uncertainty, the answer is "4+3=7".
