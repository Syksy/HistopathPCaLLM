Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Valmisteltu näytesetti ajettiin standardiprotokollan mukaisesti..." which translates to a prepared sample set processed according to standard protocol. But there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample type isn't specified here, so according to the rules, I should put "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan prostatasolukkoa..." which indicates prostate tissue, but there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. They mention high-grade PIN changes, but PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is considered a pre-malignant condition, not outright malignancy. Since there's no clear evidence of cancer, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the text notes "arvot 4 ja 3" but then states that only about 5% of the material could be examined, and they couldn't reliably assess those components. Since the malignancy is negative, Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even though there's a mention of 4 and 3, the uncertainty and lack of confirmed malignancy mean we don't report it.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is ei (no), and Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy. I need to make sure the JSON follows the syntax exactly and doesn't nest structures. Let me double-check the example given to ensure formatting is correct. Yep, looks good. No nested objects, just the three keys with the allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
