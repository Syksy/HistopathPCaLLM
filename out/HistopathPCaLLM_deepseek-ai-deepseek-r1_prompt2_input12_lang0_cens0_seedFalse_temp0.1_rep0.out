Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. So Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue... classified as benign." Since it's classified as benign, there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy mentioned, so all fields should reflect that. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the example given. The benign example correctly uses "NA" for all fields when invalid, but here it's a valid statement but benign. So Malignancy is "no", and Gleason is "NA".

Wait, the example for a benign statement had "Malignancy" as "no" and Gleason as "NA". Yes, that's correct. So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to confirm that "TURP" is the right sample type here. Electrosection shavings are indeed typical for TURP procedures. The mention of eight blocks is part of processing but doesn't affect the sample type. The key term here is "electrosection shavings", which aligns with TURP. So Sampletype is correctly "TURP".
