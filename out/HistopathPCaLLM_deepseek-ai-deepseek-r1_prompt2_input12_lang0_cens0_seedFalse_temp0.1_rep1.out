Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Electrosection shavings are typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. So Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue... classified as benign." Since it's classified as benign, there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to use "NA" for benign statements. Since the sample is benign, there's no Gleason score reported. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since the sample is benign, there's no malignancy. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. The example provided uses simple key-value pairs, so I'll follow that structure.

Double-checking the allowed values and the extracted information. Everything seems to fit. No typos or misinterpretations. The answer should be straightforward here.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
