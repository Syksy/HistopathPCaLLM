Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The provided text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. Even though it's cancer, if the Gleason isn't reported, it should be NA. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as yes, and Gleason as NA. Need to make sure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's only one mention of cancer without specifics, this should be correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
