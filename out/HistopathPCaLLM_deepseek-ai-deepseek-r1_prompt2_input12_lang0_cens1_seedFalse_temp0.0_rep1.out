Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about the sample being prostate cancer tissue but doesn't specify how it was obtained. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum". The given text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. It mentions histological examination and digipathology queues for images, but no actual grades are reported. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is yes because cancer is present, and Gleason is NA because no grades are provided. I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, with no nested elements and only the most severe lesion considered. Since there's only one lesion mentioned (prostate cancer tissue), that's the one to use. The answer should be straightforward here.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
