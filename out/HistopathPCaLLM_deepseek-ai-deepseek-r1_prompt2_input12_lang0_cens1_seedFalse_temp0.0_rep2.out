Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of how the sample was obtained—no words like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates the presence of malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being queued, but no specific grades. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me double-check the example given. The example with no valid info had all NAs, but here malignancy is present. So the answer should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
