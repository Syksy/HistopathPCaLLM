Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement. The fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." The sample is mentioned as prostate cancer tissue, but there's no explicit mention of how it was obtained. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, malignancy. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being queued, but no specific numbers like 3+4=7 or anything. So Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the method isn't specified, Malignancy is yes because cancer is present, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the example didn't have Gleason, this fits.
