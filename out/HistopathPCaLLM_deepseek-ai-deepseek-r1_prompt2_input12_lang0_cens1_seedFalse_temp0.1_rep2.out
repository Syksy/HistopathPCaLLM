Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." There's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The statement says "prostate cancer tissue," which clearly indicates a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The given text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. It talks about histological examination and high-resolution images being queued, but no specific grades. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is yes because cancer is present, and Gleason is NA since no grades are reported. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me double-check the input text again to confirm there's no hidden mention of sample type or Gleason. Yep, nothing there. So the final JSON should reflect those three answers accordingly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
