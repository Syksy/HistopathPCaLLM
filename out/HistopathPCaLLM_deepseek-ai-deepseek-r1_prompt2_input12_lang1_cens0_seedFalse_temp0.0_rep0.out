Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text here is "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The key term here is "elektrosektiolastut." I remember that "elektrosektio" refers to a procedure, and "TURP" is a type of transurethral resection. However, "elektrosektio" might be another term for TURP. Alternatively, sometimes "TURP" is called just that. But I need to confirm. Let me check: TURP is indeed transurethral resection of the prostate, and "elektrosektio" could be a Finnish term for that. So the sample type here should be TURP. But wait, the example given in the problem had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostata biopsiasta." So in this case, "elektrosektiolastut" likely refers to TURP. So Sampletype is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says "löydös siis benigni." Benign means no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei."

Gleason score. Since the finding is benign, there's no cancer, so Gleason should be NA. The example also shows that if malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text for any mention of cancer or Gleason. The text states "benigni," so no cancer. No Gleason mentioned. So the answer should be correct.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
