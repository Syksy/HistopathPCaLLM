Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to TURP in Finnish medical terms. So the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since the tumor is benign, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for non-malignant cases. So Gleason will be NA.

I need to make sure there's no mention of any malignant lesions or Gleason grading. The text confirms it's benign, so all criteria are met. No need to look for other lesions. The JSON structure should be straightforward without nested elements. Let me double-check the terms to ensure accuracy. Yep, elektrosektiolastut is TURP, benign means no malignancy, and Gleason is NA. All set.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
