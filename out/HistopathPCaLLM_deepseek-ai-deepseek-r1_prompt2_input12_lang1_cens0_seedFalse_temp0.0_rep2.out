Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastut". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to TURP, so the sample type should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "löydös siis benigni", which means the findings are benign. So malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since the sample is benign, there's no cancer to report a Gleason grade. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure follows the example, with no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results. The example provided uses "kyllä" or "ei" for malignancy, so that's covered here. The Gleason field is NA because there's no malignancy. Everything checks out.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
