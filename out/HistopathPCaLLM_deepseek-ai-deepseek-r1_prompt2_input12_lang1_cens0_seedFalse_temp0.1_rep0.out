Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The key term here is "elektrosektiolastut". I know that "TURP" stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, and "elektrosektio" likely refers to a resection. So "elektrosektiolastut" probably means TURP samples. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "löydös siis benigni." "Benigni" means benign, so there are no malignant findings. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's benign, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the rule is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any cancer or Gleason scores here. The report clearly states it's benign, so no Gleason. Also, confirming that the sample type is correctly identified as TURP based on "elektrosektiolastut". 

Double-checking the example given in the problem. The first example had "biopsy" as sample type when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". Similarly, here "elektrosektiolastut" relates to TURP. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

No conflicting information in the text. All criteria are met.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
