Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The term "elektrosektiolastut" refers to electroresection chips, which are typically from a TURP procedure. So the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "löydös siis benigni," which means the findings are benign. So Malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since the malignancy is negative, the Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were a Gleason mentioned, if the malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. In this case, there's no mention of Gleason anyway.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct, no nested structures, and using the exact allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
