Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut..." The key term here is "elektrosektiolastut". I remember that TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, and "elektrosektio" might relate to that. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The report says "löydös siis benigni." Benign means non-cancerous, so Malignancy is "ei".

Since the malignancy is benign, Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, if the tumor is benign, it's NA. But in this case, there's no Gleason score mentioned anyway.

Double-checking the example given. The first example had "biopsy", "kyllä", and the Gleason sum. The second example, which was unclear, had all NAs. Here, the sample is TURP, malignancy is no, so Gleason is NA. That fits the rules.
