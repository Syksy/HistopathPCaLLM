Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The phrase "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" might refer to the sample being taken in parts, but there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the sample is from suspected cancer tissue but the exact type isn't specified, I might have to go with "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means "suspected prostate cancer tissue". The term "syöpä" (cancer) suggests malignancy. However, the report also mentions that high-resolution images are still pending in the digital pathology queue. So, the examination isn't complete yet. The presence of suspected cancer cells might indicate malignancy, but since the results are pending, it's unclear. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion results. If the malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, should I mark it as "kyllä" or "ei" or "NA"? The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is found. Here, it's suspected but not confirmed. However, the presence of suspected malignant tissue might still warrant "kyllä", but since the report is pending further analysis, maybe "NA" is safer. But the problem states to return the worst findings. If they mention suspected cancer, maybe they are considering it as malignant until proven otherwise. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The example given in the problem had a confirmed case, so "kyllä". Here, it's suspected but not confirmed. The instructions don't specify how to handle pending cases. Maybe "kyllä" because it's suspected, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA". Wait, the possible values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report is pending, maybe "NA" is appropriate here because the final determination isn't made yet. But the text does mention "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which is "suspected prostate cancer tissue". So, does that count as malignant? The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is confirmed, so "kyllä". Here, it's suspected. Maybe in this case, the answer is "kyllä" because the suspicion is strong enough, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the malignancy is not confirmed, perhaps "ei" or "NA". The problem states to return the worst lesion's results. If they suspect malignancy, even if not confirmed, maybe the worst case is considered. But the example used confirmed cases. Since the high-res images are pending, maybe the current findings are not conclusive. So, perhaps "NA" for malignancy. But I need to check the original text again. The text says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which is "suspected prostate cancer tissue". So, the sample contains tissue suspected to be malignant. But the actual analysis is pending. So, maybe the answer here is "kyllä" because the suspicion is noted, but the final confirmation is pending. However, the problem might expect that only confirmed malignancies are marked as "kyllä". Since the example used confirmed adenocarcinoma, perhaps here, since it's only suspected, the malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei" or "NA". But "ei" would mean no malignancy found, which isn't the case. So, maybe "NA" is the correct choice here because the results are pending. 

Third, the Gleason score. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. The example included a specific mention of "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". Here, there's no such mention. So, Gleason should be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not clearly biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "näyte" (sample) from suspected cancer tissue but doesn't specify the procedure. So Sampletype is "NA". Malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, and the analysis is pending, so "NA". Gleason isn't mentioned, so "NA".
