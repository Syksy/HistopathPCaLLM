Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to fill are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: the text says "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key word here is "näyte" (sample) but there's no mention of the type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example where it's NA was when the text was unclear. Here, it's just a sample suspected of cancer, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which translates to suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the report says that high-resolution images are still pending. So they suspect malignancy but haven't confirmed it yet. The example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's only suspected and pending further analysis, maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text doesn't state any confirmed malignancy, just suspicion. So perhaps Malignancy should be NA, as it's not confirmed. But wait, the presence of suspected cancer cells might be considered as "kyllä"? Hmm. The example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's suspected but not confirmed. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe the answer is NA. Or maybe "kyllä" because they mention suspected cancer. But according to the instructions, the answer should be based on whether malignant findings were present. If it's only suspected and pending further tests, maybe it's not confirmed yet. So Malignancy: NA.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed (Malignancy is NA), the Gleason should be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason in the text, but here there's no mention of Gleason scores. The example had "4+3=7" when it was explicitly stated. Here, no Gleason is mentioned, so definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's only suspected, not confirmed. Gleason is NA because no score is given and malignancy isn't confirmed.
