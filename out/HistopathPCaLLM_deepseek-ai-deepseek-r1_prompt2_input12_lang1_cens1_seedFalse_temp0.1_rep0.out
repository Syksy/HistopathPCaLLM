Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte", which means sample. The report mentions that the sample is divided into eight parts, but there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text does mention "digipatologian jonossa" (in the digital pathology queue), which might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not sure. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I might have to default to "NA". But wait, the first example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the sample is "käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa" (initiated in eight parts), which could refer to biopsy cores. However, without explicit terms like "biopsia" (biopsy), "RP", or "TURP", it's safer to go with "NA" unless there's a hint. Hmm, maybe "käynnistetty" here refers to being processed in parts, but not necessarily the type. So Sampletype might be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text starts with "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which translates to "suspected prostate cancer tissue". The term "epäilty" means suspected, but the presence of "syöpäsolukosta" (cancer tissue) suggests malignancy. However, the report might not confirm it yet. The next sentence says "suurin osa näytemateriaalista vaikuttaa olevan eturauhasesta" (most of the sample material appears to be from the prostate), but the high-resolution images are pending. So, the malignancy isn't confirmed yet; it's just suspected. The example given in the problem had a confirmed adenocarcinoma, hence "kyllä". Here, since it's suspected but not confirmed, maybe "NA"? But the question is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. If the sample is suspected but not confirmed, does that count as "kyllä" or "ei" or "NA"? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's only suspected and not confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA". But the example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's suspected but pending further analysis, perhaps "NA" is safer. Alternatively, if "epäillystä syöpäsolukosta" is considered a finding, maybe "kyllä". But I'm not sure. The key is whether the report states that malignancy was found. Since it's suspected but not confirmed, and the high-res images are pending, maybe the answer is "NA" for malignancy.

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is uncertain here (suspected but pending), and there's no mention of Gleason scores in the text, the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "NA" because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is "NA" because it's suspected but not confirmed, and the results are pending. Gleason is "NA" because there's no mention of it.
