Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "Saatu näyte koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta ja se on käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa." The key term here is "näyte" which translates to sample. The sample is divided into eight parts, which is common in biopsies. However, the exact type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The term "käynnistetty" might refer to how the sample was taken, but without clear mention of the procedure type, I might have to default to "NA". Wait, but "biopsiasta" was in the example, and here it's "näyte" from suspected cancer tissue. Maybe "biopsy" is implied here. But the example had "Prostata biopsiasta" leading to "biopsy". Here, the sample is from suspected cancer tissue but the procedure isn't explicitly named. Hmm. Maybe "NA" is safer here since it's not clearly stated.

Next, malignancy. The text says "epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta" which means suspected prostate cancer tissue. However, the report mentions that high-resolution images are pending. So, does "suspected" mean malignancy is confirmed? The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) leading to "kyllä". Here, it's suspected but not confirmed. The presence of malignant findings would require confirmation. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy yet (maybe waiting for the images), the malignancy field might be "ei" or "NA". Wait, but "epäillystä" is suspicion, but the sample is being analyzed. The report doesn't state that malignancy was found, only that it's suspected. So until confirmed, maybe "ei" or "NA". The example's "NA" was for non-sensical text. Here, the report is pending, so maybe "NA" for malignancy as well. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the analysis is pending, then the answer isn't available, so "NA". 

Third, Gleason score. Since malignancy isn't confirmed (if we go with "NA" or "ei"), then Gleason would be "NA". If malignancy were "kyllä", then we'd look for Gleason. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so regardless, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention is about a sample from suspected cancer tissue but without procedure details. So Sampletype is "NA". Malignancy is pending results, so "NA". Gleason not mentioned, so "NA".
