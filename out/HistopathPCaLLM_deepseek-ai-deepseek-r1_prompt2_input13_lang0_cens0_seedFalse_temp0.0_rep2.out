Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so that clearly points to "biopsy." No ambiguity there.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So that's a "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text says "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The highest grade mentioned here is 4+5=9. Even though there's a mention of Gleason score 5 earlier, the highest and most severe is 4+5=9. The example uses the format with the sum, so I should present it as "4+5=9."

Wait, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions "reaching as far as Gleason score 5" but then the total is 4+5=9. The higher grade here is 4+5=9, which is the sum. So that's the one to report. The 20% might refer to the percentage of that pattern, but the Gleason grade is the sum. So the correct entry is "4+5=9."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. Check if there's any conflicting info, but the most severe is clearly stated. All set.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
