Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostate needle biopsies," so that clearly points to "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report states "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The example shows it should be in the format "major+minor=sum." The text says "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The numbers in parentheses are the major and minor grades. So combining them as 4+5=9. Even though there's mention of higher grade differentiation being 20%, the most severe lesion's Gleason is 4+5=9. 

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the format with the plus and equals signs, so "4+5=9" is correct. The rest of the samples are normal, but the highest grade is in sample B. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+5=9. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. Let me double-check the original text to confirm. Yep, all the info is there. No ambiguities here. The answer should be valid JSON without any extra nesting.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
