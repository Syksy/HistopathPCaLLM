Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's start with the first field: Sampletype.

Looking at the provided text: "The samples consist of prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations..." The key term here is "needle biopsies." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "carcinoma is observed," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes."

For Gleason grade, the report states "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The required format is major+minor=sum. Here, 4+5=9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

Now, check if there's a more severe lesion. The text mentions "higher grade differentiation consists of approx 20% on the left." But the main lesion reported is Gleason 4+5=9, which is the highest grade here. The rest are normal, so this is the most severe.

No nested structures needed. All values fit the allowed options. So the final JSON should have biopsy, yes, and 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
