Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement, the samples are mentioned as being taken from typical locations in the prostate. The text mentions "samples" in a general sense but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). There's no mention of procedures like TURP or RP, just that samples were taken. So, the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement mentions "some irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that need further inspection. However, it doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignancy. Terms like "irregularities" and "suspicious" might indicate suspicion but not a confirmed malignancy. Since there's no definitive mention of a malignant tumor, Malignancy should be "NA".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. There's a reference to differentiation patterns that need further inspection, but no specific numbers like 3+4=7 or similar. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, none of the required fields have explicit information. The sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no Gleason grade mentioned. So all values should be "NA".
