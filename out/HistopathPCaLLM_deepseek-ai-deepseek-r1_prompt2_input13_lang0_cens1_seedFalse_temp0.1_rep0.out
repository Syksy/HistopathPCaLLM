Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "some irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" that need further inspection. However, there's no explicit mention of malignancy, cancer, adenocarcinoma, or tumor. Words like "suspicious" might indicate a possibility, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's not confirmed and requires further consultation, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the report needs to mention specific grades like 3, 4, 5 in a major+minor=sum format. The given text doesn't reference any Gleason scores or grades. Terms like Gleason, grade, or numerical scores (e.g., 4+3=7) are absent. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields don't have sufficient information as per the allowed values, so they all default to NA.
