Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement, it mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate." The term "samples" here is a bit vague. They mention "sample B" and "total sample material," but there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So I might have to default to NA here since it's not specified.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection." It also refers to a "suspicious pattern" needing further verification. However, there's no clear confirmation of malignancy. Terms like "suspicious" and "warrant further inspection" suggest it's uncertain. The rest of the samples are described as ordinary with no inflammation. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, the answer here should be "no" or maybe NA. Wait, the instructions say if there's no clear malignant findings, it's "no" or NA. But the example given for an invalid statement uses NA. However, in the example where malignancy is present, it's "yes." Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "no" because they haven't confirmed it yet. Or does "suspicious" imply possible malignancy? The example with "adenocarcinoma detected" is a clear yes. Here, it's ambiguous. The user instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if there's a mention of suspicion but not confirmed, should it be "no" or "NA"? The example with the invalid statement uses NA when there's no valid info. In this case, the report is valid but doesn't confirm malignancy, so maybe "no" is appropriate. But I'm a bit unsure. Let me check the example again. The first example had "adenocarcinoma detected" leading to "yes." The second example was gibberish, leading to NA. Here, the report is valid but doesn't confirm malignancy, just suspicion. So maybe "no" because there's no definitive malignant finding. The report says "no out of the ordinary inflammation either," which might imply no malignancy, but the suspicious area is noted. Hmm. The key is whether there's a malignant tumor finding. Since it's only suspicious and requires further consultation, maybe the answer is "no" because it's not confirmed. Alternatively, if the presence of a suspicious lesion is considered a possible malignancy, but the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm it, perhaps "no" is safer. Or maybe "NA"? Wait, the instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "no" or "NA"? The example with the valid statement had a clear "yes" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "no" is correct. But I'm not entirely sure. Let's proceed with "no" for now.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades in the text, and malignancy isn't confirmed, this should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the procedure type isn't specified), Malignancy is "no" (since no confirmed malignancy), and Gleason is NA.
