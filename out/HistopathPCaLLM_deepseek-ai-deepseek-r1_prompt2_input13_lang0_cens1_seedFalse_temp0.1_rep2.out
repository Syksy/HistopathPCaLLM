Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as being taken from typical locations in the prostate. The terms used are "samples" and "sample material," but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I might have to infer. However, since none of the specific terms are present, the safest bet here is NA for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "some irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B, which suggests there's something concerning but not definitively malignant. The report states that further verification is needed. Since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, and it's not confirmed, the Malignancy field should be NA. It's not a clear yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows that if there's a malignant finding, the Gleason should be in the format "major+minor=sum." However, since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and there's no mention of Gleason grades like 3, 4, or 5, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's suspicious but not confirmed, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades. The example given for an invalid statement also uses NA for all fields when there's no clear data, which aligns with this scenario.
