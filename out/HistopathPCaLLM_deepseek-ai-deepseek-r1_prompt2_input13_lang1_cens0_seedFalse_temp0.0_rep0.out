Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Näytteinä prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita tyyppipaikoista otettuna..." The key term here is "paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, check for malignancy. The report states, "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa..." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The correct format is "major+minor=sum." Here, 4 and 5 add up to 9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions 20% involvement on the left, but the highest Gleason is 4+5=9 from sample B. Other samples are normal, so this is the primary one. No nested structures in the JSON, just flat keys. All values are present and correctly formatted. No issues here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
