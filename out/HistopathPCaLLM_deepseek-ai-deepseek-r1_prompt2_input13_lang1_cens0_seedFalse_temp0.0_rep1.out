Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The report mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita", which translates to "thick needle biopsies of the prostate". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Biopsioita" is plural for biopsies, so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa" – "Carcinoma is found in sample B". So malignancy is present, which corresponds to "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason tasolle 5 ja kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The correct format is "major+minor=sum". Here, it's 4+5=9. Even though the order is mentioned as 4+5, the sum is 9. The user instructions specify to use the major and minor components, so "4+5=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example given uses the format with "+" and "=", so following that. The other samples are normal, so only the B sample with Gleason 4+5=9 is considered.

Double-checking the allowed values: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is correctly formatted. All set.
