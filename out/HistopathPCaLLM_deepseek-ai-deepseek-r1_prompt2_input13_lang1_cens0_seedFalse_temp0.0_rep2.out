Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The report mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita", which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a biopsy, the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa", meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. So malignancy is present, which corresponds to "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason tasolle 5 ja kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)". The correct format is major+minor=sum. Here, major is 4, minor 5, sum 9. So it should be "4+5=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The other samples are normal, so only sample B's Gleason 4+5=9 is considered. 

Double-checking the allowed values and syntax. Everything seems to fit. The JSON structure should have the three fields with the extracted values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
