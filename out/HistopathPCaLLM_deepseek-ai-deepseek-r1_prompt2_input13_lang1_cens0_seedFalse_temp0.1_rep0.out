Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate." The term "biopsioita" is the plural of biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," meaning carcinoma was found in sample B. Carcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text says "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The correct format is "major+minor=sum," so that would be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON and that only the worst lesion's results are included. The example provided uses the highest Gleason score mentioned, which is 4+5=9 here. Other samples don't show significant findings, so we only report the worst one from sample B.

Double-checking the terms to ensure accuracy. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignancy is confirmed with carcinoma. Gleason is correctly formatted. All looks good.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
