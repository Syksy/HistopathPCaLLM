Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies of the prostate." The term "biopsioita" is the plural form of biopsy, so the sample type here should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa," which means "Carcinoma is detected in sample B." Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The structure required is "major+minor=sum." Here, the primary pattern is 4 and the secondary is 5, summing to 9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions that in sample B there's carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples show normal structure. So the worst is indeed 4+5=9. No nested structures, just the three fields. Everything else in the report doesn't affect these three fields. So the final JSON should correctly reflect these three points.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
