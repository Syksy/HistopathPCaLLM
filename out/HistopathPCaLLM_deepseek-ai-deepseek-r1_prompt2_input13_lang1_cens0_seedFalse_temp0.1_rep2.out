Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Näytteinä prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita tyyppipaikoista otettuna..." The key term here is "paksuneulabiopsioita," which translates to "thick-needle biopsies." So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states, "Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa..." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the text mentions "kokonais Gleason taso on 9 (4+5)." The format required is "major+minor=sum." Here, the major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. So it should be "4+5=9."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered. The report mentions that in sample B there's carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9, and other samples are normal. So the worst is correctly captured here.

No nested structures allowed, so each field is straightforward. No issues with the example provided, so the JSON should reflect these values accurately.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
