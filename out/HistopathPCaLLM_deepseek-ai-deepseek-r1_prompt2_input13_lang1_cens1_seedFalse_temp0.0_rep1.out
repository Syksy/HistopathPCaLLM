Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was a biopsy, which was mentioned as "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current report, the text starts with "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." which translates to samples taken from typical locations of the prostate. The term "biopsiasta" isn't used here. The report mentions "näytteet" (samples) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So there's no clear indication of the sample type. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) and that consultation is needed. However, it doesn't explicitly state malignancy. There's a mention of "poikkeavaisuuksia" (abnormalities) but not confirmed malignancy. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, and the example required confirmed malignancy for "kyllä", here it's not confirmed. So Malignancy would be "ei" or NA? Wait, the example had "kyllä" when malignancy was found. Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant. But the user's instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. However, the text says "näytteissä ei vaikuta esiintyvän tavallisesta poikkeavaa tulehdustakaan" (no signs of inflammation), but the main point is the suspicious pattern needing consultation. Since it's not confirmed, maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. If the sample is suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "ei" (no malignancy) or NA (not applicable/unknown)? The example given for a non-sensical report used NA. But here, the report is meaningful but inconclusive. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). Since the worst here is a suspicious pattern but not confirmed, maybe Malignancy is "ei" because it's not confirmed as malignant. Alternatively, if the suspicion is considered as possible malignancy, but the user's example required explicit mention. Since the example required "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) for "kyllä", here there's no such mention. So Malignancy would be "ei" or NA. Hmm. The user's example for a non-sensical report used NA, but this report is structured. The key is whether there are malignant findings. Since it's only suspicious and needs consultation, but not confirmed, the answer might be "ei" (no malignancy) or NA. But according to the instructions, if there's no malignancy, it's "ei". If the sample is inconclusive, maybe NA. But the user's example used NA when the report was non-sensical. Here, the report is structured but inconclusive. The presence of "poikkeavaisuuksia" (abnormalities) but not confirmed as malignant. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei" because it's not confirmed. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "ei" because the report doesn't state malignancy, only suspicion. So Malignancy: "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy confirmed), Gleason is NA.
