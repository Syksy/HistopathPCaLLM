Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." The term "näytteet" means samples, and there's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The word "biopsiasta" (from biopsy) isn't present here. The text mentions taking samples from typical locations, which might be a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Näytteessä B havaitaan jonkin verran poikkeavaisuuksia" (some abnormalities in sample B) and mentions "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) that needs consultation. But it doesn't confirm malignancy. The other samples are normal. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, the malignancy field might be NA. However, the options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since it's not confirmed, maybe NA is safer.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. The suspicious pattern hasn't been confirmed, so there's no Gleason provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not clear if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is NA because it's suspected but not confirmed. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades. The example given in the problem where the answer is all NAs when the text isn't a proper report supports this conclusion.
