Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista..." The term "näytteet" means samples, and it mentions they were taken from typical locations. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text just says samples were taken. But since it's about taking samples from the prostate, maybe it's a biopsy? However, the example where "biopsy" was used had the word "biopsiasta". Here, the term isn't present. So maybe it's unclear. The instructions say to use NA if not specified. So Sampletype might be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) in sample B, which needs consultation. But it's not confirmed as malignant. The rest of the samples are normal. Since it's suspicious but not confirmed, and there's no explicit mention of malignancy, maybe Malignancy should be NA. The example given had a clear malignancy with "adenokarsinoomaa", but here it's uncertain. So Malignancy: NA.

Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. But since malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no mention of Gleason grading here, Gleason should be NA. The example had a clear Gleason score when malignancy was present. Here, since it's suspicious but not confirmed, and no Gleason is mentioned, it's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's only suspicious, not confirmed. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it. The answer should reflect all three as NA.
