Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The example given helps, so I need to follow that closely.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to samples taken from typical locations of the prostate. The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the term used is "näytteet" (samples) but it doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). Since there's no mention of the procedure type, I think Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says in sample B there are some abnormalities ("poikkeavaisuuksia") with differentiation patterns that are suspicious enough to consult a colleague. However, it's not confirmed as malignant yet; they need confirmation via consultation. The other samples are normal. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, just suspected, the answer here should be "ei" or "kyllä"? Wait, the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's suspicious but not confirmed. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since it's not confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei" because there's no definitive malignancy stated. Or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, NA. If the sample is uncertain, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they are unsure and need consultation, maybe it's considered not confirmed, so malignancy would be "ei"? Or maybe NA? The example for a non-sensical report used NA for all. But here, the report is sensible but inconclusive. The question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If they are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as "ei" or "kyllä"? The example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" because the presence isn't certain. Alternatively, maybe NA. But the options don't have "epävarma", so perhaps "ei" is safer. Or maybe the presence of suspicious patterns would be considered as possible malignancy, but the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If it's only suspected, not confirmed, then maybe "ei". Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The text says "suspekti patterni" which means suspicious pattern. But without confirmation, so the answer might be "ei" because malignancy isn't confirmed. Alternatively, maybe the presence of suspicious findings would still be considered as "kyllä" but I think the correct approach is to only mark "kyllä" when malignancy is explicitly stated. Since here it's only suspected, the answer is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed (if we answered "ei" for malignancy), then Gleason should be NA. If malignancy were "kyllä", then we'd need to look for Gleason scores. But in the given text, there's no mention of Gleason grades. The example included "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to "4+3=7". Here, the text doesn't mention Gleason at all, so regardless of malignancy, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the procedure type isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (since suspicious but not confirmed)
Gleason: NA (no Gleason mentioned)

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
