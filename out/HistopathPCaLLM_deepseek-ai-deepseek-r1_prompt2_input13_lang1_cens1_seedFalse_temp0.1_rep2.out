Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" which translates to samples taken from typical prostate locations. The term "näytteet" (samples) is plural, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't clearly stated here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The text mentions "suspekti patterni" (suspicious pattern) and that consultation with a colleague is needed. However, it doesn't explicitly state malignancy is present. The phrase "poikkeavaisuuksia" (abnormalities) and needing confirmation suggests suspicion but not a confirmed malignancy. Since it's not confirmed, we can't say "kyllä", and it's not clearly benign either. So Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. There's a reference to "Gleason luokilla" in the example, but here there's no such mention. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the necessary information isn't explicitly present in the text.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
