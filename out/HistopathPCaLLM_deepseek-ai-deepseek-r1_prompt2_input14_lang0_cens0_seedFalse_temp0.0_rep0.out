Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" is probably a typo for prostatectomy. So a prostatectomy specimen would be from a radical prostatectomy, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 (60%) would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4, so 3+4=7. But the way it's phrased here is a bit confusing. The "larger portion of score 3" might mean that the primary pattern is 3, making it 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. Here, since the major is 3, it's 3+4=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetectomy preparate" is likely a typo for prostatectomy, which is RP. Malignancy is definitely yes. Gleason is 3+4=7. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
