Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" is probably a typo for prostatectomy. So, a prostatectomy specimen would be RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The report states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 (60%) suggests that the major component is 3 and minor is 4. So it's 3+4=7. But the way it's written here is "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", which might just state the sum. However, the example includes both the components and the sum. The text mentions the larger portion is 3 (60%), so major is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user said to report the most severe lesion. If there's a tertiary pattern, but in this case, it's just 3+4=7. The example uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. Here, major is 3, but the sum is still 7. However, the way the Gleason is reported here is "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with the larger portion being 3. So the correct notation would be 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostatectomy specimen)
Malignancy: yes (carcinoma is malignant)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. Also, check if the input is a valid statement. The given example seems valid as it's a coherent report. So the final JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
