Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" is probably a typo for prostatectomy. So a prostatectomy specimen would be from a radical prostatectomy, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report says "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion is score 3, so that would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4. So it's 3+4=7. But the way it's written here, the larger portion is 3, which is 60%, so the major is 3, minor is 4. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the format with the sum, so I should follow that. The answer should be in the specified JSON format with those three keys. Let me double-check the original text for any other possible mentions, but it seems straightforward here. No other tumor findings mentioned that are more severe. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy yes, and Gleason 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
