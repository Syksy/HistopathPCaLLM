Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." Wait, "prostatetectomy" might be a typo for "prostatectomy". Since it's a prostatectomy specimen, the sample type should be RP. So Sampletype is RP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format major+minor=sum. The report states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4, so 3+4=7. But the way it's phrased here says "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". If the majority is 3, then the major is 3 and minor is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. However, sometimes the order might be written as major + minor. Wait, the standard is that the first number is the primary (most prevalent) grade, and the second is the secondary. If the larger portion is 3 (60%), then primary is 3, secondary is 4. So 3+4=7. Therefore, Gleason is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no higher grade lesion mentioned. The text refers to the "most severe lesion" and the example takes the most severe. Here, the report mentions Gleason 7 as the highest, so that's correct. No other higher grades are noted.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
