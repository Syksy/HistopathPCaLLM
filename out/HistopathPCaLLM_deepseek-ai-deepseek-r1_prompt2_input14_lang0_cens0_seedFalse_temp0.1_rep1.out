Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think that's a typo and should be "prostatectomy", which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report says "tumorous growth" and mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example format is major+minor=sum. The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 would mean the major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, so 3+4=7. But the way it's written here says "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Hmm, maybe the major is 3 and minor is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example uses quotes around the values. Also, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions "larger portion of score 3", but since the sum is 7, and the components are 3 and 4, the correct notation is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the original text for any other possible mentions. The rest of the report talks about no breach, clean margins, etc., but doesn't affect the three fields. Alright, that should be correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
