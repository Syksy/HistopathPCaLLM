Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "prostatetectomy preparate". I think that's a typo and should be "prostatectomy", which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report says "tumorous growth" and mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma". Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Wait, Gleason 7 can be either 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The larger portion being score 3 would mean the major component is 3 and minor is 4, so 3+4=7. But the way it's phrased here is a bit confusing. The "larger portion of score 3" might mean that 3 is the major grade. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses "4+3=7" as the format, so following that, "3+4=7" is correct here. 

Double-checking the Sampletype: "prostatetectomy" is likely a typo for prostatectomy, which is RP. Malignancy is definitely yes because carcinoma is malignant. Gleason is 3+4=7 based on the description. So the final JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
