Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and talks about samples being run in batches. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text refers to samples and batches but doesn't specify the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and references a Gleason 7 score from a colleague's comparison. However, the current report doesn't confirm malignancy. It says further investigation is needed to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Since there's no definitive confirmation of malignancy here, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7". The text here mentions a colleague compared the patient to another with Gleason 7, but the current specimen's investigation hasn't confirmed a Gleason score yet. The report states that more sampling is needed to rule out mid-grade findings. Therefore, there's no confirmed Gleason grade in the current data, so Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the statement doesn't provide definitive information on sample type, malignancy, or a confirmed Gleason score.
