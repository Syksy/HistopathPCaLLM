Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Prostatectomy typically refers to RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which clearly indicates malignant findings (karsinooma = carcinoma). So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text states "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". This seems a bit confusing. The Gleason score is usually the sum of the two most common grades. Here, it's mentioned as level 7, which would be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The "isompi osuus" (larger portion) is grade 3, which would mean 3 is the major and 4 the minor. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7" when major is 4. So if the major is 3 and minor 4, the sum is still 7, but the order is 3+4. However, sometimes the major is the higher grade. Wait, no, Gleason scoring is based on the most common (major) and second most common (minor) patterns. If the major is grade 3 (60%) and minor grade 4, then the score is 3+4=7. But the way it's written here: "Gleason 7-tasoista" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the major is 3 (60%), minor is 4 (since 3+4=7). So the correct notation is "3+4=7".

Therefore, the JSON should have Gleason as "3+4=7". 

Let me double-check. The example in the instructions had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order in the JSON is major + minor. Here, the major is 3 (60%) and minor is 4, leading to 3+4=7. That's correct. So the answer should be:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
