Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report says "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which indicates malignant findings (karsinooma = carcinoma). So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason score, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 7-tasoista" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason 7 can be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Here, the major component is 3 (60%), but wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next. If the major is 3 (60%) and minor is 4 (40%), the sum would be 3+4=7. But the text says "Gleason 7-tasoista" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3". Wait, maybe the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user instruction says to take the worst lesion. The example in the prompt uses the major and minor from the worst lesion. The text here says "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%", which might mean the major component is 3 (60%) and minor is 4 (40%), leading to 3+4=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".
