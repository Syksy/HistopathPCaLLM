Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so I think Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report says "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa," which clearly indicates malignant findings (karsinooma = carcinoma). So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 7-tasoista" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". So the major pattern is 3 (since it's the larger part, 60%), and the minor would be 4 because 3+4=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the order matters. In Gleason scoring, the higher grade is written first if they are different. If the major is 3 and minor is 4, but the sum is 7, that would be 3+4=7. However, sometimes the order is based on the majority. Wait, the user's example had 4+3=7. But in the given text, the major component is 3 (60%), but Gleason 7 can be either 3+4 or 4+3. Wait, no—Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the highest remaining pattern (minor). Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is the sum of the most predominant grade and the highest grade present, even if it's less in quantity. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me recall: the Gleason score is the sum of the most common pattern and the highest grade present. For example, if the tumor has 60% grade 3 and 40% grade 4, the score would be 3 + 4 = 7. But sometimes it's reported as primary + secondary, where primary is the most extensive, and secondary is the next most extensive. So in this case, since 60% is grade 3 and the rest is grade 4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The text mentions "pahimman leesion tulokset," so even if there are other findings, we take the highest Gleason. Here, it's 7, which is correctly captured.
