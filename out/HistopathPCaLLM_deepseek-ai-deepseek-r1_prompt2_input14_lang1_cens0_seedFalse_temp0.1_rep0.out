Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa," which means they found a Gleason 7 carcinoma. Since carcinoma is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report mentions Gleason 7, with the major component being score 3 (60%). Wait, but Gleason scores are primary and secondary grades. If the total is 7, and the major is 3, then the secondary must be 4 (3+4=7). However, the text says "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". "Isompi osuus" means larger portion, which would be the primary grade. So primary 3, secondary 4, sum 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report doesn't mention multiple lesions, just the main one. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Double-checking the terms. Prostatektomia is RP. Malignancy confirmed with carcinoma. Gleason breakdown correctly parsed from the percentages and total score. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
