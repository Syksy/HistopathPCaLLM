Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me break down the steps.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP", or "NA". The given report mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which means the tumors are cancerous. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text mentions "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". Gleason scores are typically primary + secondary = sum. Here, the sum is 7. Since the major component (primary) is 3 and the sum is 7, the minor (secondary) must be 4 (3+4=7). However, the text says "isompi osuus" (larger part) is 3, which is a bit confusing because usually the primary is the higher grade. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. If the sum is 7 and the major component is 3, then the minor would be 4, making it 3+4=7. But typically, the primary is the higher grade. However, the user's example has 4+3=7, which is a different pattern. But according to the report, the larger portion (60%) is score 3. So maybe it's 3+4=7. But I need to check the exact phrasing. The user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's result. The report says "Gleason 7-tasoista" and "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3". So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the order might be different. Let me confirm. In Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (most prevalent) is listed first, then the secondary (next most prevalent). However, if the higher grade is present, even if less in quantity, it might be considered. But the user's example uses the major (higher grade) first. But in this case, the report says the larger portion (60%) is 3, and the sum is 7. So 3 + 4 =7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
