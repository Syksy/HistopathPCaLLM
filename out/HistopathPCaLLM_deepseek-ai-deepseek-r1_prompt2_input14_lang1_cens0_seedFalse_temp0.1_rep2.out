Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatektomia-preparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa", which clearly indicates malignant findings (karsinoomaa = carcinoma). So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason 7-tasoista" and breaks it down into "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%". That suggests the major component is 3 (60%) and minor is 4, since 3+4=7. Wait, but Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the sum is 7, it could be 3+4 or 4+3. The text says "isompi osuus" (larger portion) with score 3 (60%), so primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". Here, the sample type is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 3+4=7. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
