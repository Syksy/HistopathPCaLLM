Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa..." which translates to samples being processed into cassettes as part of routine. The text mentions "prostatakudokseen" (prostate tissue) but doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. There's a mention of "prostatabiopsioita" (prostate biopsies) in the example, but here, the sample type isn't clearly specified. So Sampletype might be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) which could indicate something suspicious, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. The report also says it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and they suggest further sampling to rule out findings. Since there's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, the answer here might be "ei" (no) or NA. But wait, the example given in the instructions had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was mentioned. Here, there's no direct mention of cancer, just atypical structures. So Malignancy might be "ei" or NA. However, the example where malignancy was unclear used "NA". Hmm, need to be careful. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions needing more tests, maybe "ei" isn't correct. The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no confirmation, maybe it's NA. Wait, the example where the text was nonsensical used NA for all. Here, the text is coherent but doesn't confirm malignancy. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei" if no malignancy is found, but the report is inconclusive. Wait, the text says "mahdotonta arvioida" (impossible to assess) and suggests further testing. So maybe the answer is NA because it's not confirmed. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the sample doesn't show clear malignancy, but has atypical growth, does that count as "ei" or NA? The example with "kyllä" had adenocarcinoma. Here, no such mention. So Malignancy should be "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if it's uncertain, maybe NA. The instructions say "NA" for benign findings. Wait, the third field's NA is for benign. So if malignancy is not present, it's "ei", and if uncertain, maybe NA. But the user instructions for Malignancy allow "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". In this case, since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions unusual growths needing further testing, perhaps the answer is "ei" (assuming no malignancy found) or NA. But the example where malignancy wasn't clear used NA. Wait, the example given in the user's message where the text was nonsensical had all NAs. But in the first example, when adenocarcinoma was present, it was "kyllä". Here, the text mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample's findings are unclear. So the current sample's malignancy status isn't confirmed. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason score. The text refers to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample's Gleason isn't reported. They suggest more sampling to rule out intermediate grade (GG) findings. Since there's no Gleason reported for the current sample, the answer is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't specified (NA), Malignancy is NA (not confirmed), Gleason is NA.
