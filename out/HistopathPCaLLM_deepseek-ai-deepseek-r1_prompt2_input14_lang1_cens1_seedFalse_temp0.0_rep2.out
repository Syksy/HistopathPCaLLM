Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task based on the given medical report. The user wants me to extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa..." and "kattavampi näytteenotto tehtäisiin". The term "näytteet" refers to samples, and "näytteenotto" means sampling. However, the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. The text talks about a comprehensive review of the patient's prostate tissue but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. So, I think the sample type here is NA because it's not clearly mentioned.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) and references a previous patient with Gleason 7. However, there's no direct mention of malignant findings in the current sample. The text states that a more comprehensive sampling is needed to exclude certain findings. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, the answer should be NA. They can't confirm it yet, so it's not a clear yes or no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. The example given in the instructions uses a patient's previous case where Gleason 7 was mentioned, but the current sample doesn't report any Gleason score. The text says they need to do more sampling to exclude certain grades. Since there's no confirmed Gleason in the current sample, it should be NA.

Putting it all together: sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and no Gleason is reported here. So all fields should be NA.
