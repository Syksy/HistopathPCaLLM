Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task based on the given medical report. The user wants me to extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, presence of malignancy, and the Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, which translates to prostate biopsy. In the current case, the report talks about "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" and mentions "näytteenotto" which means sampling. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or something else. The term "prostatakudokseen" refers to prostate tissue, but the sample type isn't clearly specified. So I might have to go with "NA" here since it's not clearly stated.

Next, malignancy. The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is adenocarcinoma, indicating malignancy. In the current report, there's mention of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) and a reference to a previous patient with Gleason 7. However, the current report states that it's impossible to assess invasion or margins, and they suggest further sampling to rule out certain findings. There's no explicit mention of malignant findings here, just suspicions that need more testing. So the malignancy field should be "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions needing more tests, maybe "ei" isn't right either. But the presence of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" could be atypical but not confirmed as malignant. The instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, maybe "ei" is correct. Or perhaps "NA" if it's uncertain. Hmm. The example had a clear malignancy, but here it's ambiguous. The user instructions say if there's no malignancy, use "ei". But if the report doesn't confirm, maybe "NA"? Wait, the third field's Gleason is "NA" if benign. So if malignancy is "ei", Gleason would be "NA". But in this case, the report mentions a previous patient with Gleason 7, but that's not the current patient's result. The current patient's report doesn't state a Gleason score, just that more sampling is needed. So malignancy here is uncertain, but the presence of "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" might be considered as not malignant yet. So maybe "ei" for malignancy.

Gleason grade: The example had a clear 4+3=7. Here, the report refers to a colleague's patient who had Gleason 7, but the current patient's sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason. They suggest further testing to exclude certain findings. So there's no Gleason reported for the current sample. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly stated (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "NA". Malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? Since the report doesn't state malignancy, but mentions unusual growths, maybe "ei" if they are not confirmed as malignant. But the example used "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was present. Here, no malignancy is confirmed, so "ei". Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy. So the JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If there's a suspicion but not confirmed, does that count? The example had a clear malignancy. Here, the report is inconclusive. So maybe malignancy is "NA"? Because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state clearly, maybe "NA" is safer. For example, if the sample is inadequate or the findings are uncertain, "NA" would be appropriate. The text says "On mahdotonta arvioida..." which means it's impossible to assess invasion or margins. So maybe malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain. Therefore:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

But wait, the report mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" which could be atypical but not necessarily malignant. The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" which is malignant. Here, the findings are unusual but not confirmed. So malignancy is "ei" only if it's confirmed benign. If it's uncertain, maybe "NA". The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then "ei" or "NA"? The options are "kyllä", "ei", "NA". If the sample is inadequate to determine, then "NA". Since the text says it's impossible to assess, maybe "NA" is correct for malignancy. So the final answer would have all three as "NA". But the sample type: the text mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" which might refer to biopsy samples. The term "näytteenotto" is sampling, which could be biopsy. But it's not explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So sampletype is "NA".

Therefore, the correct JSON is all "NA".
