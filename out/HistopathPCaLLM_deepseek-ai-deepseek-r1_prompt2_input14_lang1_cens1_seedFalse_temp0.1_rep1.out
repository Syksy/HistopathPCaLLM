Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as part of a comprehensive review of the patient's prostate tissue. The text talks about samples being processed into cassettes normally, and mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" which translates to samples D-G were processed in the first tissue part. There's also mention of "prostatabiopsioita" (prostate biopsies) in the example, but in the current text, the exact type isn't directly stated. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample seems to be part of a routine process, but without clear terms like "biopsia", "prostatektomia", or "TURP", I might have to default to "NA". However, the mention of "näytteet" (samples) being processed into cassettes could imply biopsy samples, but it's not certain. The example given uses "biopsy" when the term "biopsiasta" is present. Since this text doesn't have that exact term, maybe "NA" is safer here.

Second, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (peculiar growth structures) peripherally. There's a reference to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. The report states that a more comprehensive sampling is needed to rule out certain findings. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy like "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) or "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant), and the findings are inconclusive, the malignancy field should be "NA". The example given uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is mentioned, which isn't the case here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". The text refers to a previous patient with Gleason 7, but the current sample doesn't report any Gleason score. The suggestion is to do more sampling to exclude certain findings, implying that the current sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear but possibly biopsy, but since it's not explicitly stated, "NA". Malignancy isn't confirmed, so "NA". Gleason isn't provided, so "NA".
