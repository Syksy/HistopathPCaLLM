Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part based on the provided example and guidelines.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the given text, the sample is mentioned as part of a comprehensive review of the patient's prostate tissue. It talks about processing cassettes normally, and mentions "näytteet D-G ajettiin ensimmäisessä kudososassa" which translates to samples D-G were processed in the first tissue part. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example where it's unclear uses NA, so maybe here it's also NA since the type isn't specified.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" (unusual growth structures) peripherally. However, there's no clear mention of malignancy like "adenokarsinooma" or "carcinoma". The report also states that a more comprehensive sampling is needed to exclude mid-grade GG findings. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here might be "ei" or "NA". Wait, but "erikoisia kasvurakenteita" could be suspicious but not confirmed as malignant. The example where malignancy wasn't clear used NA. So maybe here Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, just noted as unusual.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. The text refers to a colleague's patient who had Gleason 7, but this patient's report doesn't state a confirmed Gleason score. It suggests further sampling to exclude mid-grade (GG) findings. Since the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't specified (NA), Malignancy isn't confirmed (NA), Gleason not provided (NA). So the JSON should have all NAs. Wait, but the example where Gleason was mentioned in another patient's case still resulted in NA for the current patient. So yes, in this case, even though a previous patient had Gleason 7, the current report doesn't confirm it for this patient. Hence, all fields NA.
