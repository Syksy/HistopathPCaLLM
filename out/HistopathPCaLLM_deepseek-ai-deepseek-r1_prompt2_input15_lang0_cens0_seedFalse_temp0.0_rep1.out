Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. I recall that "TURP" samples are often referred to as chips or chippings. So, even though the exact word "TURP" isn't there, "chippings" is a common term associated with TURP procedures. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". The user wants the format "major+minor=sum". Here, the most represented (major) is 4, but what's the minor? The sum is 8, so if major is 4, minor would be 4 (4+4=8). However, the text mentions "variants" which might imply different patterns. But since the sum is given as 8 and the major is 4, the minor must also be 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no more severe lesion mentioned. The text refers to the most represented being Gleason 4 and the sum of 8, which is the highest mentioned. So that's the correct one. No nested structures, just the three fields. All values fit the allowed options. So the final JSON should have TURP, yes, and 4+4=8.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
