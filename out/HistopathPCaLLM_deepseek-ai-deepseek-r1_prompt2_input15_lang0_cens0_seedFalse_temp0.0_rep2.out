Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. I recall that "TURP" samples are often referred to as chips or chippings. So, even though the exact word "TURP" isn't there, "chippings" likely indicate a TURP sample. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". The typical Gleason format is major + minor = sum. However, here it's mentioned as a sum of 8. Since the most severe lesion is considered, and the primary pattern is 4, but the sum is 8, the minor would be 4 (4+4=8). So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The example uses "4+3=7", so following that format, "4+4=8" is correct. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8. No conflicting information in the text. All other parts don't mention another lesion, so the most severe is this one.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
