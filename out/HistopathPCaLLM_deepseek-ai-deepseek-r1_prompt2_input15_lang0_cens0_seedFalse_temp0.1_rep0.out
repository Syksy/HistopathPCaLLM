Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, I'll look at the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. The input text starts with "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g..." The term "chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves removing parts of the prostate, often described as chips or shavings. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "does confirm adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Wait, Gleason scores are typically a combination of two grades, like 4+3=7. But here it's a sum of 8. However, sometimes in reports, especially if there's a predominant pattern with tertiary patterns, the highest Gleason might be considered. But the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7". The user wants "major+minor=sum". The text here mentions Gleason 4 as the most represented, but the sum is 8. That's a bit confusing. If the sum is 8, maybe it's 4+4=8. Since the primary and secondary are both 4. The text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants", which might imply that the major is 4, and the minor could also be 4, leading to 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the major and minor components. Here, the sum is 8, which would be 4+4. So the structured Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. Let me double-check the input text again to confirm. Yes, mentions TURP-related terms (chippings, shavings), confirms adenocarcinoma, and Gleason sum 8 with 4 being the main component. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
