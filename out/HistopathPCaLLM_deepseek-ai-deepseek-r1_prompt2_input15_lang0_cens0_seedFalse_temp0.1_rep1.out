Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g". The term "chippings" isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. I need to think if "chippings" relates to any of these. TURP samples are often referred to as chips or chippings, so I think TURP is the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary and secondary grades. However, the description here mentions Gleason 4 as the most represented (which would be the primary grade) but doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. The sum is 8, so if primary is 4, secondary would also be 4 (4+4=8). But the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. However, since the sum is given as 8 and the primary is 4, it's safe to assume 4+4=8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no more severe lesion mentioned. The text doesn't mention any other lesions, so this is the most severe one. Also, the structured data shouldn't have nested structures, so just the three fields in a flat JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
