Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g" and refers to "shavings". The term "chippings" and "shavings" are commonly associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chippings. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would involve the entire prostate being removed, which isn't indicated here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text clearly states "does confirm adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". However, the Gleason score is typically given as a combination of the primary and secondary grades. Here, it's stated as a sum of 8, but the primary and secondary grades aren't explicitly mentioned. The most common combination for a sum of 8 is 4+4=8, but sometimes 5+3=8 or 3+5=8. However, the text says Gleason 4 is the most represented, which suggests the primary grade is 4. If the sum is 8, then the secondary grade would also be 4 (4+4=8). So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the entire sample confirms adenocarcinoma with Gleason sum 8, that's the most severe here. The example provided uses "4+3=7", so following that format, "4+4=8" is appropriate.
