Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Prostate tissue material" but doesn't specify the exact procedure. Terms like "biopsy" or "TURP" aren't present. The sample was processed, but without clear indication of the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, determining if there are malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that clinical notes mention a suspected adenocarcinoma, but it's explicitly noted that this wasn't based on histopathology. The current examination couldn't confirm malignancy as representative markers like Gleason weren't determined. So Malignancy should be NA because the report doesn't confirm the presence of a malignant tumor through histopathology yet.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text mentions a clinical suspicion of Gleason sum 8 or above, but again, this isn't confirmed histologically. Since the report states that Gleason couldn't be determined, the Gleason field should be NA. Even though there's a suspicion, it's not an actual finding from the current sample analysis.

Putting it all together, all three fields should be NA because the report doesn't provide definitive information based on histopathological examination. The key points are the lack of specific sample type, unconfirmed malignancy, and undetermined Gleason grade in the current report.
