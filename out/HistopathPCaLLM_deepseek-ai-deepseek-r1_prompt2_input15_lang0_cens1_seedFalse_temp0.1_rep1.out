Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight..." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text just refers to "prostate tissue material" without specifying the procedure. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma, but it's explicitly stated that this wasn't based on histopathology. The current examination couldn't determine Gleason or other markers, and findings need revision. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy from the histopathology yet, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. The text says "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and the suspicion of Gleason sum 8+ was based on clinical notes, not histopathology. Since the current exam didn't confirm any Gleason grade, Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and Gleason isn't determined in the current report.
