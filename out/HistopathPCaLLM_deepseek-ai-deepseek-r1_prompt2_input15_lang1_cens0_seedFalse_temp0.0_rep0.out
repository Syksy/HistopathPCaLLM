Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "höylälastuja," which translates to "chips" or "shavings." In medical terms, TURP typically involves removing prostate tissue in small chips, so "höylälastuja" likely refers to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, malignancy. The report states "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was seen in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text mentions "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." The primary pattern is 4, but the secondary isn't explicitly stated. However, the sum is 8. Since Gleason scores are primary + secondary = sum, if the sum is 8 and primary is 4, secondary must be 4 (4+4=8). But the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja," which might imply that the major component is 4, but minor could be another variant. Wait, but the sum is 8. If the sum is 8 and primary is 4, then secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text specifies both grades. The user example had "4+3=7" where both were mentioned. Here, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4" and "pistesumma 8." So maybe the major is 4, minor is 4. So the correct format is "4+4=8".

Wait, but sometimes in reports, if the sum is given without specifying both components, but here it's stated that the most representative is Gleason 4 and its variants, leading to a sum of 8. So likely, it's 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".
