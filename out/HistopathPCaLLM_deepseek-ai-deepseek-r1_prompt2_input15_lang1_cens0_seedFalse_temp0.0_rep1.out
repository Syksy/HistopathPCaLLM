Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan höylälastuja". The term "höylälastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which I recall is typically associated with a TURP procedure (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here should be "TURP". The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So that's the first field done.

Next, malignancy. The text states "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma is seen in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes). The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Clear enough.

Now, Gleason score. The report mentions "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". Wait, Gleason score is usually a sum of the two most common patterns. Here, it says the most representative is 4, and the sum is 8. So if the primary pattern is 4, the secondary must be 4 as well (4+4=8). But the wording is a bit unclear. The user example had "4+3=7", so the format is "major+minor=sum". Here, the sum is 8, and the main pattern is 4. Since the sum is 8, and the primary is 4, the secondary must be 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja". Does that mean the major component is 4, and the minor could be different variants of 4? Or maybe there's a minor component not specified? But the sum is given as 8. So regardless of the variants, the sum is 4+4=8. So the correct format is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. Let me double-check the original text for any possible errors. The sample is "höylälastuja" which is TURP. Adenocarcinoma is present, so malignancy is yes. Gleason sum is 8, with the main being 4. So the answer should be correct.
