Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "höylälastuja" which translates to "shavings" or "chips." In medical terms, TURP samples are often referred to as chips or shavings. So "höylälastuja" here likely indicates a TURP procedure. But wait, sometimes "höylä" can also refer to a biopsy method. Wait, the term "prostatan höylälastuja" – "prostate shavings" – TURP is a procedure where they remove parts of the prostate through the urethra, producing chips. So I think Sampletype here is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report says "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa" which means "adenocarcinoma is seen in almost all." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

Gleason score. The text mentions "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." Wait, the structure here is a bit confusing. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum". The report says the most representative is Gleason 4, and the sum is 8. But in Gleason scoring, the sum is the two most prevalent grades. If the major is 4, then the minor would be 4 as well (4+4=8). But the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja" – so the main pattern is 4, and there are different variants. Maybe the minor is also 4? Or is there a mention of another grade? Let me check again. The user example had "4+3=7" where the sum is 7. Here, the sum is 8. The text says "pistesumma 8" (score sum 8). So the Gleason should be "4+4=8" because 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. Wait, the phrase is "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." So the main (major) is 4, and the minor might be 4 as well, leading to 8. Alternatively, maybe the minor is another grade, but the sum is 8. But since the sum is 8 and the major is 4, the minor must be 4. So the correct Gleason would be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. Let me confirm. The sample is "höylälastuja" which is TURP. Adenocarcinoma is present, so malignancy is yes. Gleason sum is 8 with major pattern 4, so minor must be 4. So the answer should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
