Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me start by reading the input text carefully.

The sample provided is "yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja". The term "höylälastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which I recall from previous examples is associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so "kyllä" for malignancy.

For Gleason score, the key phrase is "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". The main pattern here is Gleason 4, but since it's the "edustavin" (most representative), maybe the major component is 4. However, the sum is 8. Wait, Gleason scores are the sum of the two most common grades. If the sum is 8, then the possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, or 3+5. But the text says "edustavin Gleason 4" which suggests the major component is 4, and the minor could be 4 as well (4+4=8). However, the exact wording isn't clear. The user instructions say to report the major and minor as given. The example had "4+3=7" when the text stated "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". Here, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4" and "pistesumma 8". Since it's not explicitly stating both grades, but the sum is 8, maybe the correct format is "4+4=8". But wait, the user example took the explicit numbers mentioned. If the text only mentions 4 as the main and the sum is 8, perhaps the minor is 4. Alternatively, maybe the minor isn't specified. But the user requires "major+minor=sum". If the report only gives the sum as 8 and mentions Gleason 4 as the main, but doesn't specify the minor, should we infer? The instructions say to use the reported Gleason. Since the text says "pistesumma 8" but only mentions 4 as the main, maybe the minor is 4. So "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text gives both components. The example had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. Here, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja", which might imply that the major is 4 and the minor is also 4 (since variants of 4). So the sum is 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, malignancy is yes, Gleason 4+4=8.
