Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me start by reading the input text carefully.

The sample provided is "yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja". The term "höylälastuja" translates to "chips" or "shavings", which I recall is typically associated with a TURP procedure (transurethral resection of the prostate). So for Sampletype, TURP seems right. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Biopsy would be if it's a needle biopsy, RP is radical prostatectomy. Since TURP is a different procedure, I'll go with "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa", which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so "kyllä" (yes) for Malignancy.

Gleason score: The report states "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8". The primary pattern is 4, but the secondary isn't explicitly given. Wait, the user instructions say to use major + minor = sum. But here, the sum is 8, but if the primary is 4, then secondary must also be 4 (since 4+4=8). However, the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja", which might mean the major is 4, but minor could be different variants of 4? Or maybe the minor is 4 as well. The example given in the instructions had 4+3=7. Here, the sum is 8, so likely 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. However, since the sum is 8 and the primary is 4, the minor must be 4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the user example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which translates to 4+3=7. So the format is major + minor = sum. Here, the sum is 8, and the major is 4. So minor must be 4. Therefore, "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since höylälastuja is TURP)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text mentions "edustavin Gleason 4", which implies the major component is 4, and the sum is 8. So this should be correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
