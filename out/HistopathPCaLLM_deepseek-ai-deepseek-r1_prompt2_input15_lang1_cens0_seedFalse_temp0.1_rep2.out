Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "höylälastuja," which translates to "chips" or "shavings." In medical terms, TURP procedures often produce such chips. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was found in almost all samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text mentions "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8." The primary pattern is 4, but the secondary isn't explicitly stated. However, the total score is 8. Since Gleason scores are the sum of the two most common patterns, and the total is 8, if the primary is 4, the secondary must also be 4 (4+4=8). But the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja," which might imply that the main component is 4, but there are different variants. However, the total is given as 8. So the correct format would be "4+4=8".

Wait, but sometimes in reports, if the primary is 4 and secondary is another pattern, but the sum is 8, maybe it's 4+4. But the text says "pistesumma 8" directly. So the correct Gleason entry should be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8.
