Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is referred to as "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which translates to prostate tissue material. The report mentions "skooppitutkimuksessa" which I think refers to a scope examination, possibly a biopsy. But the term "biopsy" isn't explicitly stated. However, "skooppitutkimus" might be a transliteration of "scope examination," which in medical terms could mean a biopsy. Alternatively, maybe it's a TURP sample? Wait, TURP is transurethral resection of the prostate, usually for BPH. The text doesn't mention anything about resection or surgery. The sample is described as having very little material, which is more typical of a biopsy. So I'll go with "biopsy" for Sampletype.

Next, Malignancy: whether there are malignant findings. The text says that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" meaning they can't confirm Gleason or other markers. However, there's a mention of clinical suspicion of adenocarcinoma ("kliiniset muistiinpanot mainitsivat epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta"), but this isn't based on histopathology. The key here is that the current sample doesn't confirm malignancy. The report says that potential findings need to be re-examined in the next session. So, since the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, the answer should be "ei" (no) because the existing sample doesn't show malignancy, even though there's a suspicion. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they couldn't confirm any markers and the suspicion is based on clinical notes, not the histopathology, the answer should be "ei".

For Gleason, the rule is to report the worst lesion's result as "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA". However, the text mentions that clinical notes suspected Gleason sum 8, but this isn't based on histopathology. So the actual sample doesn't have a confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA.
