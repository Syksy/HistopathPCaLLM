Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "biopsiasta" would indicate biopsy, but here the text says "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" and mentions that all material was processed. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample type isn't clearly stated, so maybe NA here.

Next, malignancy. The report says that clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma, but the histopathology hasn't confirmed it yet. The key line is "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" which means they can't confirm malignancy markers like Gleason. Also, "potentiaaliset löydökset täytyy katsoa uudelleen" suggests potential findings need re-examination. So, the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. The answer here should be "ei" since no malignancy was found in the sample, even though there's a suspicion. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they couldn't confirm, maybe "ei" because the sample itself doesn't show malignancy, just a suspicion from clinical notes. So "Malignancy" would be "ei".

For Gleason score, the report mentions clinical notes suspected Gleason sum 8 or ISUP GG4, but this isn't based on histopathology. Since the current sample doesn't confirm any Gleason, and the malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are confirmed in the sample. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed Gleason in the current sample.
