Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each field step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "biopsiasta" would indicate a biopsy, but here the text doesn't explicitly say biopsy. However, the sample is referred to as "näytemateriaali" (sample material), and there's a mention of "prostatabiopsioita" later, but that's in the example, not in the actual input. Wait, looking at the input, the first line says "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka..." which suggests that the sample is from the prostate, but the type isn't clearly stated. The example given in the problem had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type is NA here.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report says that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" (no representative Gleason or other markers can be confirmed at this point). Also, it mentions that clinical notes suspected adenocarcinoma, but this wasn't based on histopathology. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy in the current sample, the malignancy field should be NA. The current sample doesn't confirm malignancy, so it's not "kyllä", and since there's suspicion but not confirmed, it's not "ei" either. So NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is major+minor=sum. However, the report states that they can't confirm Gleason here. The clinical notes mention suspicion of Gleason sum 8, but that's not based on histopathology. Since the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, Gleason should be NA. Even though there's a mention of Gleason 8, it's part of the clinical suspicion, not the actual histopathological finding here. So the answer is NA for Gleason.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified (not biopsy, RP, or TURP). Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed Gleason in the current sample.
