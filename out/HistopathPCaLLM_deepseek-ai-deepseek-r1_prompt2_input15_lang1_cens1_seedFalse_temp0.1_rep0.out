Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka..." The term "kudosmateriaali" refers to tissue material, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions that the sample was processed with high priority due to clinical suspicions, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, check for malignancy. The report says that there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but it clarifies that this wasn't confirmed by histopathology. The key phrases are "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" (no markers like Gleason can be confirmed here) and mentions that potential findings need to be re-examined. Since the current histopathology doesn't confirm malignancy, Malignancy should be "ei" (no), because the report doesn't state any malignant findings in the sample, only suspicions from clinical notes which aren't confirmed here.

For Gleason score: The clinical notes mention suspicion of Gleason sum 8 or ISUP GG 4, but the report explicitly states that this isn't based on histopathology. Since there's no confirmed malignancy in the current sample, Gleason should be NA. The example given in the instructions shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found in the sample, and Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy to report a score.
