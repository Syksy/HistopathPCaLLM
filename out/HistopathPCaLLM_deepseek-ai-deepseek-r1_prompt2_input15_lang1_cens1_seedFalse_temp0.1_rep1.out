Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which translates to prostate tissue material. The term "skooppitutkimuksessa" might refer to a scope examination, possibly a biopsy. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So Sampletype is likely "biopsy". If not clear, maybe NA, but "biopsy" seems correct here.

Next, malignancy. The report says that "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" which means they can't confirm malignancy markers yet. However, there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma mentioned in clinical notes. But since the histopathology hasn't confirmed it, the current sample doesn't have malignant findings. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no) because the report doesn't confirm it, only suspicion. But wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they couldn't confirm, maybe "ei". But the example given in the problem shows that if there's a suspicion but no confirmation, malignancy is "ei". For instance, in the example where Gleason is mentioned but not confirmed, malignancy is "kyllä". Wait, no. Let me check the example again. In the first example, they found adenocarcinoma, so malignancy is "kyllä". In the second example, which is a non-sensical report, everything is NA. Here, the report says that they can't confirm Gleason or other markers, and the suspicion of adenocarcinoma is based on clinical notes, not histopathology. So the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

Third, Gleason. Since the sample doesn't confirm any malignancy, Gleason should be "NA". The clinical notes mention Gleason sum 8, but that's not based on histopathology. The instructions say to report the Gleason only for malignant findings. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.
