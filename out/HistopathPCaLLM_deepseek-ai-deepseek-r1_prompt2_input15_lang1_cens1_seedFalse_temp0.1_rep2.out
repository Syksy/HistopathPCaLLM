Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is referred to as "Prostatan kudosmateriaali" which translates to prostate tissue material. The report mentions "skooppitutkimuksessa" which might refer to a scope examination, possibly a biopsy. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The term "näytemateriaali" means sample material, but without a specific procedure named, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text says that clinical notes mention suspicion of adenocarcinoma, but it's not confirmed by histopathology. The key phrase here is "edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" which means they can't confirm Gleason or other markers. Also, "potentiaaliset löydökset täytyy katsoa uudelleen" implies that potential findings need re-examination. Since there's no confirmed malignancy in the current sample, the answer should be "ei" or maybe "NA". But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since they can't confirm, and it's based on clinical suspicion not histopathology, the malignancy field should be "ei" because the current sample doesn't show malignancy. Wait, but the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings) in the sample. The report states that they can't confirm Gleason or other markers here, and the suspicion is based on clinical notes, not the histopathology. So the sample itself doesn't have confirmed malignancy. So "ei".

For Gleason, since there's no confirmed malignancy in the sample, it should be "NA". The clinical notes mention Gleason sum 8, but that's not based on histopathology. The report explicitly says "edustavaa Gleasonia... ei voida vahvistaa", so the Gleason score isn't present here. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are confirmed in the sample. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed score from the sample.
