Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The term "biopsies" here clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "contains carcinoma focuses," which means there's a malignant tumor present. So Malignancy is "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." Since architecture 3 is covering more (2/3) and 4 is less (1/3), the major grade would be 4 and minor 3, making the sum 7. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The statement talks about different lengths but the conclusion is score 7 with 4 and 3 components, which is the highest mentioned. There's no higher grade like 5 mentioned. So the answer should be correct as 4+3=7.

Double-checking for any nested structures or invalid data. All fields fit the allowed values. The JSON should be straightforward without nesting. So the final JSON should have the three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
