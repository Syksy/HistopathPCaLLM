Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." The term "biopsies" clearly indicates the sample type is a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "carcinoma focuses," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is definitely "yes".

Now the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text says "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3." Typically, the major pattern is the higher grade, but here it's 3 covering 2/3 and 4 covering 1/3. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller proportion, it might affect the score. But in this case, the conclusion states the score is 7, which is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Since architecture 3 is covering 2/3 (majority) and 4 is 1/3, the primary grade is 3 and secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes when the higher grade is present, even if it's less, but in some cases, like if the higher grade is more than 5% but less than the primary, it's still considered secondary. Here, the report explicitly states that the score is 7 from 3 and 4, with 3 being 2/3 and 4 being 1/3. So the major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no other Gleason mentioned. The text also mentions "some Gleason 4 -type... spanning less than one third." But the conclusion clearly states the score as 7 from 3 and 4. So the final answer should be "3+4=7".
