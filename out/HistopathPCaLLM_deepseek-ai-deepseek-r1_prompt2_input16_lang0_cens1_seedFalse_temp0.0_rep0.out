Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The terms used are "inspected material" and "sample material," but without specific procedure names. So, the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement talks about "multiple suspicious foci" and mentions that grading should be done manually. However, it doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignant cells or a confirmed diagnosis. The focus is more on the need for manual grading due to digitalization issues. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be "NA."

For the Gleason grade, the example given in the instructions uses the format "major+minor=sum." The provided text mentions mid-grade differentiations like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. The conclusion is that grading needs to be done manually later. Since no actual Gleason score is reported here, just a mention of possible grades that couldn't be assessed reliably, the Gleason field should be "NA."

Putting it all together, none of the required fields have explicit information in the statement. All values should be "NA."
