Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The term "suspicious foci" suggests it's a sample taken for examination, but the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "suspicious foci" which implies possible malignancy, but there's no clear confirmation. It talks about needing manual grading because digital assessment is inconclusive. Since there's no definitive mention of malignant tumor findings, the answer here might be NA. The example given in the problem where the statement was unclear also resulted in NA for Malignancy.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The text discusses mid-grade differentiations like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that assigning scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. The conclusion is that grading should be done manually later. Since no Gleason grade is actually reported here, the answer should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because there's no confirmation of malignant findings. Gleason is NA because no grade was reported. The example with an unclear statement also resulted in all NAs, so this seems consistent.
