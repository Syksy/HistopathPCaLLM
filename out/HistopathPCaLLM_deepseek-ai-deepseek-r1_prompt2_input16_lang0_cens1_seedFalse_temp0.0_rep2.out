Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The term "inspected material" is a bit vague. It mentions the prostate but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. Since there's no explicit mention of the sample type like "biopsy" or "RP", I should mark this as NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci" which suggests there might be concern for malignancy, but it doesn't explicitly state that a malignant tumor was found. The conclusion says that grading should be done manually, implying that the current digital assessment isn't conclusive. Since there's no definitive mention of malignancy, the answer here should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The text talks about mid-grade differentiations like 3+4 or 4+3 being hard to assess due to digitalization issues. However, it explicitly states that assigning scores was inconclusive and that manual grading is needed. Since no Gleason score is provided in the report, the Gleason field should be NA.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because there's no confirmation, and Gleason is NA because the score wasn't determined yet.
