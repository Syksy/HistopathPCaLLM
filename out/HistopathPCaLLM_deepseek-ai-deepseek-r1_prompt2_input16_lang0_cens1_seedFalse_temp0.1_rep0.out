Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." The terms like "biopsy," "RP" (radical prostatectomy), or "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly stated here. The text refers to "sample material" but doesn't specify the type. So I think Sampletype should be NA since there's no clear indication of the sample type.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "suspicious foci" and discusses cell differentiation grades, but it also states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive. There's no direct mention of a malignant tumor being identified. The conclusion suggests that further manual grading is needed. Since there's no definitive confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The text talks about mid-grade differentiations like 3+4 or 4+3 but mentions that these are difficult to assess due to digitalization issues. However, since no actual Gleason score is reported and the conclusion is that manual grading is needed, there's no specific Gleason provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, none of the fields have explicit data, so all should be NA. The example provided for an inconclusive statement also results in all NAs, which matches this scenario.
