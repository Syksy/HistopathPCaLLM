Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, and I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion's results are considered.

First, I'll look for the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." However, it doesn't explicitly state the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, determining malignancy. The text refers to "multiple suspicious foci" which might suggest possible malignancy, but there's no clear confirmation of malignant tumor findings. The conclusion mentions that grading needs to be done manually, implying uncertainty. Since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or confirmed malignancy, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the text discusses the difficulty in assigning scores due to resolution issues in digital images. It mentions mid-grade differentiations like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that these can't be reliably assessed. Since no actual Gleason score is provided, the Gleason field should be NA.

I need to ensure that the JSON output doesn't include nested structures and only uses the allowed values. The example provided by the user shows that if any information is missing or inconclusive, the fields default to NA. In this case, all three fields lack explicit information, so the final JSON should have all NAs.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
