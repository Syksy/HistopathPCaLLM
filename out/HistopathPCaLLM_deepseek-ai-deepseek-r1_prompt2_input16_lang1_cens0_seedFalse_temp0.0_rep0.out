Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa" which translates to three fusion biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so "kyllä" (yes) for malignancy.

Now, Gleason score. The example given uses "major+minor=sum". The text says "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This indicates that the majority (2/3) is grade 3 and the minority (1/3) is grade 4. So the major is 4 and minor is 3? Wait, no. Wait, the majority is 3, but the highest grade is 4. Wait, Gleason scoring takes the most prevalent grade (major) and the highest other grade (minor). Wait, no, actually, the current Gleason system adds the most common grade and the highest grade present. But in the example given in the problem statement, "4+3=7" is used when the major is 4 and minor is 3. So in this case, the report mentions "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3" (grade 3 in 2/3) and "4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3" (grade 4 in 1/3). So the primary pattern is 3 (since it's more prevalent) and the secondary is 4. Wait, but according to current Gleason grading, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common, but if there's a higher grade present even in a smaller amount, that might be considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if a higher grade is present, even if less extensive, it's considered. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The current Gleason score (Grade Groups) consider the primary and secondary patterns. The primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. But if there's a tertiary pattern of higher grade, that might affect the score. However, in this case, the report says that 2/3 is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement uses 4+3=7 when the major is 4. So the order matters. The user's example had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. In the current case, the majority is 3 (2/3) and the secondary is 4 (1/3). So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But wait, the text says "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." So the summary says score 7, which is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But I need to check if the order is correct. The primary pattern is the one with the higher grade if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. If the most extensive is grade 3 and the next is grade 4, then it's 3+4=7. If the most extensive is grade 4 and the next is grade 3, it's 4+3=7. In this case, the report states that grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".
