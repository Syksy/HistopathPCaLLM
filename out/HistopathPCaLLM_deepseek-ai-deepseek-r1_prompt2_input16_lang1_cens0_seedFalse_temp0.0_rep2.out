Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa" which translates to three fusion biopsies. So the sample type should be biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so malignancy is definitely "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The format should be major+minor=sum. The text says "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". This translates to a score of 7, where the primary pattern (major) is 3 in about two-thirds and the secondary (minor) is 4 in one-third. Wait, but Gleason grading is based on the most predominant and the next most predominant patterns. However, if the majority is pattern 3 and the minor is 4, the sum would be 3+4=7. But the way it's written here, the primary is 3 (2/3) and secondary 4 (1/3), so the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4. So I need to check if the order here is correct. The text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3", which means the majority is 3 (since 2/3 is more than 1/3), so the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But wait, in the example, the user had "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So the order is major + minor. So in this case, since 3 is the major (2/3) and 4 is minor (1/3), the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the problem is, sometimes the highest grade is taken as the primary, even if it's a smaller proportion. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (primary) and the next most common (secondary), regardless of which is higher. Wait, no, actually, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) considers the primary as the most predominant pattern, and the secondary as the next most predominant. However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might affect the score. Wait, but in the example given by the user, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7", which aligns with the primary being 4 and secondary 3. So in the current case, the primary is 3 (2/3) and secondary 4 (1/3), so the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format would be "3+4=7". But I need to check if the user's example is a guide. The example had "4+3=7" when the primary was 4. So the order is primary then secondary. Therefore, in this case, the answer should be "3+4=7". The text says "score 7" which matches the sum. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text also mentions "Gleason 4 -tyypin silmukoituvaa rakennetta vajaalta kolmasosalta karsinooman pituudelta". So Gleason 4 is present in less than a third of the carcinoma's length. So the majority is 3, and the minor is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. That's correct. So the JSON should have Gleason as "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
