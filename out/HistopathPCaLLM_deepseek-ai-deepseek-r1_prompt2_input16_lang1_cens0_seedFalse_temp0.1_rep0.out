Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana kolme fuusiobiopsiaa prostatan suspektista fokuksesta." The word "fuusiobiopsiaa" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci, indicating malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the report says "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." This translates to a score of 7, with Grade 3 architecture in about 2/3 and Grade 4 in 1/3. The primary pattern is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason scoring takes the most common (major) and the highest minor component. However, in modern grading, if Grade 4 is present even in a minor component, it's added. Here, major is Grade 3 (2/3) and minor is Grade 4 (1/3), so sum is 3+4=7. The correct format is "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses "4+3=7", but here it's 3+4=7. The order matters for the score group, but the sum is still 7. The user's instructions specify "major+minor=sum" as the format. So "3+4=7" is correct.
