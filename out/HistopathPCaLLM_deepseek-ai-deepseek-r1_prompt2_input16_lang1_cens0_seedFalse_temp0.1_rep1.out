Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa" which translates to three fusion biopsies. So the sample type should be biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so malignancy is definitely "kyllä".

Now the Gleason score. The format should be major+minor=sum as integers. The example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7". Looking at the text: "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." Here, they mention a score of 7, with grade 3 architecture in about 2/3 and grade 4 in 1/3. So the major pattern is 4 (since it's the higher grade) and minor is 3. Wait, but the sum is 4+3=7. Even though the majority is grade 3, in Gleason scoring, the highest grade is listed first. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most prevalent high-grade pattern. Wait, I need to be careful here. The current Gleason grading system (since 2016) groups grades into Grade Groups, but the score itself is still the sum of the primary (most common) and secondary (next most common) patterns. However, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the highest grade if it's more than a minor component. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The text says "score 7" and breaks it down into 3 and 4. But the way it's written: "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3". So grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3. In Gleason scoring, the primary grade is the one that is most predominant. If grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then the primary is grade 3 and secondary is grade 4, making the score 3+4=7. But the example given in the instructions had 4+3=7. Wait, but the user's example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which is correct as the higher grade is listed first if it's the major component. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next. However, if the higher grade is present even in a smaller amount but more than 5%, it's considered the secondary. Wait, maybe in this case, since grade 3 is 2/3 (majority) and grade 4 is 1/3 (but still significant), the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the text says "score 7", which can be either 3+4 or 4+3. However, the way the user's example was structured, when they mention "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", they sum to 4+3=7. So perhaps in the current case, the primary is grade 3 and secondary grade 4, leading to 3+4=7. But the problem is that the user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. Wait, the instructions specify "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". So if there are multiple lesions, take the worst one. The text mentions "näissä tason 3 graduksen kasvua, joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4". So in some areas, there's grade 3 and some grade 4. The summary says "score 7" with 3 in 2/3 and 4 in 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 7. But according to current grading, the primary is the most extensive pattern. However, if there's a higher grade pattern, even if less extensive, but the highest grade is considered the primary. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the one with the highest grade if it's present in any quantity. Wait, no. Let me recall: the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. However, if a higher grade is present, even if less extensive, it's included. Wait, no. For example, if the majority is grade 3, but there's a smaller amount of grade 4, then the Gleason score is 3+4=7. If the majority is grade 4 and some grade 3, it's 4+3=7. The sum is the same, but the order matters. The example given by the user had 4+3=7, which would be if grade 4 is the primary. In the current case, the primary is grade 3 (2/3) and secondary grade 4 (1/3), so the score should be 3+4=7. But the text says "score 7", which is correct. However, the user's instructions say to take the worst lesion. So if there are multiple cores, the worst Gleason is the one with the highest sum and pattern. In this case, the worst would be 4+3=7 or 3+4=7? Wait, the sum is the same, but the grouping is different. Grade group 3 is 4+3=7, and grade group 2 is 3+4=7. So the order matters. The user's example used 4+3=7. So in the current case, the report says "score 7" but the breakdown is 3 (2/3) and 4 (1/3). So the primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7. Wait, maybe I need to check the exact wording. The text says: "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." So the architecture is 3 in 2/3 and 4 in 1/3. So the primary is 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the Gleason is 3+4=7. But the user's example had 4+3=7. So the order depends on which is the primary. So in this case, the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But the user's instructions say to take the worst lesion. If there's a lesion with 4+3, that's worse than 3+4. But in this case, the text mentions "joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4", which might mean that in some areas, there's grade 4. The summary says that in the total 15mm, 2/3 is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4. So the primary is 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the highest grade present is considered the primary. Wait, no. The primary is the most extensive pattern. If the highest grade is present but not the most extensive, it's the secondary. For example, if a tumor has 60% grade 3 and 40% grade 4, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. If it's 40% grade 4 and 60% grade 3, then it's 3+4=7. Wait, no. Wait, the primary pattern is the one that is most common. So if grade 3 is 60% and grade 4 is 40%, primary is 3, secondary 4. If grade 4 is 60% and grade 3 is 40%, primary is 4, secondary 3. So in the current case, since grade 3 is 2/3 (66.6%) and grade 4 is 1/3 (33.3%), the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the Gleason is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct entry is "3+4=7". But the user's example had "4+3=7" when the grades were 4 and 3. So the order depends on which is primary. Therefore, in this case, the answer should be "3+4=7". But I need to check the original text again. The text says: "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3 karsinooman osasta." So the architecture (arkkitehtuuri) is grade 3 in 2/3 and grade 4 in 1/3. Therefore, the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the Gleason is 3+4=7. Therefore, the JSON should have "3+4=7" for Gleason. But wait, the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa". So if there are multiple lesions, take the worst one. The text mentions three biopsies: "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa". The sizes are 7, 6, and 2mm. In these, there's grade 3 and some grade 4. The summary says the total is 15mm, with 2/3 grade 3 and 1/3 grade 4. So the worst lesion would be the one with the highest Gleason. If any of the individual biopsies had a higher Gleason, that would be taken. But the text doesn't specify individual biopsy scores. It says "Yhteenvetona löydös score 7", which is the total. So perhaps the worst is 3+4=7. Alternatively, if any of the biopsies had 4 as the primary, but the summary doesn't mention that. The text says "joskus jonkin verran myös Gleason 4", which translates to "sometimes some Gleason 4 as well". So maybe in some areas, the primary is 4. But the summary says that overall, the majority is 3. So perhaps the worst lesion is 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct Gleason is "3+4=7". But I need to confirm. Another way: in the example given by the user, the sentence had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7". So the order is 4 first because it's the major component. In the current case, the major component is 3, so it's 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7".
