Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. Let me break down each part.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa prostatan suspektista fokuksesta." The word "fuusiobiopsiaa" translates to fusion biopsy, which is a type of biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text talks about "karsinoomafokuksia" which means carcinoma foci. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The report mentions "Gleason 4 -tyypin silmukoituvaa rakennetta" and "score 7 yhteensä 15mm matkalta, jossa 3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3." The primary pattern is 3 and secondary is 4, but wait, the highest grade is considered the primary. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary grade is the most predominant, and the secondary is the next most. However, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, sometimes it's considered. The text says "3 arkkitehtuuri n. 2/3 ja 4 arkkitehtuuri n. 1/3," meaning 2/3 is grade 3 and 1/3 is grade 4. But according to current grading, the primary is the higher grade if present. Wait, no, the primary is the most common pattern. If grade 3 is 2/3 and grade 4 is 1/3, then primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum would be 3+4=7. The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" when the major is 4 and minor 3. So here, major is 3 and minor 4? Wait, no. Wait, the primary (major) is the most common, which is grade 3 (2/3), and the secondary (minor) is grade 4 (1/3). So the Gleason score should be 3+4=7. But the text also mentions "score 7," which aligns with that. So the correct format is "3+4=7."

Wait, but in the example given by the user, when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, summa 4+3=7," the JSON uses "4+3=7." So the order is major + minor. So in this case, since the majority is 3 (2/3) and the minor is 4 (1/3), the sum is 3+4=7. But sometimes, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller proportion, it might be considered the major. Wait, no. The standard is that the primary is the most predominant pattern, and the secondary is the next most predominant. However, if there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is considered if it's a tertiary, but in this case, it's just two patterns. So the primary is 3 (most common), secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. The text also says "score 7," which matches. So the correct entry is "3+4=7."

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "fuusiobiopsiaa")
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma is malignant)
Gleason: 3+4=7 (as per the majority and the score mentioned)

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
