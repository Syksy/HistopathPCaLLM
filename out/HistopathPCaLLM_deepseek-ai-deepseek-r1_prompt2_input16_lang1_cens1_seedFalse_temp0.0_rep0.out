Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure it into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here refers to the sample, but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about digital histopathology and mentions that the samples should be graded manually before digitizing, but it doesn't specify the sample type. So, Sampletype is probably NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "suspektista fokuksesta" (suspicious foci) and "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" (varying degrees of cell differentiation grades). However, it doesn't explicitly state that malignancy was found. The focus is more on grading difficulties due to digital resolution issues. Since there's no clear mention of malignancy (like adenocarcinooma or other cancer terms), Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. The text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but in the context of explaining why grading is difficult due to digitalization errors. It doesn't report an actual Gleason score for the sample. The example given is hypothetical, so there's no specific Gleason score provided. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because there's no explicit confirmation of malignancy. Gleason is NA because no actual score is reported, only examples of possible scores that couldn't be determined.
