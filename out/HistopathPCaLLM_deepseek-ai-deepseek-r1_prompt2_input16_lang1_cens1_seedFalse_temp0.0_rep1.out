Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here refers to the sample, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which refers to varying differentiation grades of cells. However, it doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignancy. The discussion about grading (like 3+4 or 4+3) suggests they're considering cancer grading, but the conclusion is that the grading can't be determined from the digital images and needs manual review. Since there's no clear mention of malignant findings, just suspicion and grading difficulties, the Malignancy field should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but states that determining the exact score is impossible due to resolution issues in digital images. Since no actual Gleason score is reported, just hypothetical examples, the Gleason field should be "NA".

So putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and no Gleason score is provided.
