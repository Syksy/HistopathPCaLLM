Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here refers to the sample, but there's no mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" which refers to varying differentiation grades of cells. However, it doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignancy. The discussion about grading (like 3+4 or 4+3) suggests that malignancy might be considered, but the conclusion is that grading can't be done accurately due to resolution issues in digital images. Since there's no clear mention of malignant findings, and the uncertainty in grading, the Malignancy field should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3, but states that determining the exact score isn't possible due to digitalization problems. Since no actual Gleason score is reported, and the sample isn't confirmed as malignant, the Gleason field should be "NA".

So the final JSON should have all fields as NA because the necessary information isn't explicitly present or determinable from the given text.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
