Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here is a bit vague. The example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". However, this text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, I should default to "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "suspektista fokuksesta" which suggests suspicious areas, but it doesn't confirm malignancy. It talks about varying differentiation grades but states that precise scoring isn't possible due to resolution issues. There's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or other malignancies. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be "NA". Even though the text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3, these are hypothetical scenarios explaining why manual grading is needed. The actual report doesn't assign a Gleason score to the sample, so it's not applicable here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
