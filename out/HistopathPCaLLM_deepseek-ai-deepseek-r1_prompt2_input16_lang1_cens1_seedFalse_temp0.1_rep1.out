Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "materiaali" here is a bit vague. It mentions "prostatassa" (in the prostate) but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. There's no mention of any procedure like biopsy or surgery. So Sampletype might be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text talks about "suspektista fokuksesta" (suspicious foci) and "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja" (varying degrees of cell differentiation grades). However, it doesn't explicitly state malignancy. The conclusion mentions that grading should be done manually, but there's no confirmation of malignancy. So Malignancy might be NA because it's not confirmed, just suspected.

For Gleason score, the text mentions examples like 3+4 or 4+3 but says that determining the exact score is difficult due to resolution issues in digital images. Since they can't assign a score here and there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's suspected but not confirmed. Gleason is NA because they couldn't determine the score from the digital images.
