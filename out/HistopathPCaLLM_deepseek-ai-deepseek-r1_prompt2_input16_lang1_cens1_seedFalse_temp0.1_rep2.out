Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittu materiaali koostuu useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa." The term "suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa" suggests that they're looking at suspicious areas, but the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned. The text later mentions "näytesisällön gradeeraus tulisi tehdä manuaalisesti laseilla ennen digitalisointia," which refers to sample grading before digitization. However, there's no clear mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "vaihtelevan tasoisia solujen erilaistumisgradeja," which indicates varying differentiation grades. Differentiation grades are often related to cancer, but the text doesn't explicitly state malignancy. It discusses grading issues due to digital resolution problems and mentions possible grades like 3+4 or 4+3, which are Gleason scores for prostate cancer. However, since the actual malignancy isn't confirmed here—only that grading is difficult—it's unclear if malignancy is present. The conclusion is that the grading should be done manually, but there's no definitive statement of malignancy. So Malignancy would be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. The text mentions "keski-graden (esim. 3+4 tai 4+3)" as examples, but these are hypotheticals used to illustrate the difficulty in grading due to digitization errors. There's no actual Gleason score reported for the sample. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed. Gleason is NA because no actual score is given, just examples.
