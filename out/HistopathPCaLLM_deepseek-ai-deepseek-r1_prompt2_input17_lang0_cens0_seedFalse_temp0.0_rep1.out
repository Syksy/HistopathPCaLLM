Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate is processed..." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Multiple clear foci emerge... with the most dominant Gleason grade 4", "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", and "Perineural invasion is also prominent". All these indicate the presence of a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The statement says "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the dominant is grade 4 and some grade 3, that's the primary and secondary patterns. The sum is correct. There's no mention of tertiary patterns here, so we stick with 4+3=7.

No nested structures in the JSON. Check for validity. All values fit the allowed options. The example provided uses "biopsy" and "4+3=7", so following that format. The sample type is RP, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7. That should be the correct structured data.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
