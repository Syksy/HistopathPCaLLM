Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "Multiple clear foci emerge... with the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." Gleason grading is used for cancerous tissue, so the presence of Gleason grades 4 and 3 indicates malignancy. Additionally, phrases like "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat" confirm malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text states "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." The primary (major) pattern is 4, and the secondary (minor) is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses the most dominant Gleason mentioned, which aligns with the instruction here. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere in the text. 

Also, check if there's any ambiguity. The sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy, malignancy is confirmed with tumor infiltration, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated. No nested structures in the JSON, just flat key-value pairs. 

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
