Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." so that immediately makes me think of RP. Prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." The presence of a tumor with Gleason grading indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The report states "most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses the most dominant grade mentioned, which aligns with the instructions. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere in the text. Also, check that there's no nested structures in the JSON. The answer should be straightforward with the three keys and their respective values.

Double-checking the sample input: "Prostatectomy" is RP, malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason 4+3=7. All looks good. No conflicting information in the text. The other parts about perineural invasion and tumor infiltration support malignancy being yes. The Gleason is clearly stated as 4 and 3, so the sum is 7. No other grades are mentioned that are higher. So the structured JSON should reflect these values accurately.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
