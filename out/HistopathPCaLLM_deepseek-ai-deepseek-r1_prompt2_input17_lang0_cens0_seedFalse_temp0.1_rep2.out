Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first sentence mentions "Prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. The example given in the instructions also uses "biopsy" when the text mentions biopsy, so I need to check for similar keywords. The term "prostatectomy" here definitely points to RP.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "malignant tumor findings" indirectly. It talks about "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," which indicates cancer. Additionally, phrases like "Perineural invasion is also prominent" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat" are clear signs of malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant. The text states "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." The dominant grade is the major, and the minor would be the next. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the most severe mentioned, and in this case, the dominant is grade 4 with some 3, so that's the primary pattern. There's no mention of tertiary patterns here, so we stick with 4+3=7.

Also, check if the statement is valid. The example given for an invalid one was a jumble of terms, but this statement is coherent and describes clear pathological findings, so it's valid. Therefore, all fields should be filled appropriately.

Double-checking each part: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. That should be it.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
