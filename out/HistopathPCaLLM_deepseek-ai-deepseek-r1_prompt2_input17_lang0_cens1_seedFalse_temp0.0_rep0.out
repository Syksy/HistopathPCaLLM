Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "prepared samples" and talks about processing through standard procedures. It refers to the prostate's right and left sides and different sample labels (A-D, E-F, etc.). However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text seems to be a preliminary report discussing sample processing and future assessments, but the actual sample type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are being assessed to see if they're present or if the material is fully healthy. However, it doesn't state that any malignancy was found. It's more about an upcoming assessment. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text refers to Gleason grades between 3 to 5 being assessed but doesn't provide a specific grade. It's part of a future evaluation, so there's no reported Gleason grade here. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, none of the fields have explicit information, so all values are NA.
