Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples mentioned are processed through standard procedures, and they refer to different parts of the prostate (right side, left side, samples A-D, etc.). The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" but doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. There's no clear indication of the sample type, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text talks about assessing differentiation stages like Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's mentioned in the context of a future assessment. The current report is preliminary, and the actual assessment is pending. There's no definitive statement of malignancy found, so Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 are being considered in the assessment, but it's part of what will be evaluated later. There's no specific Gleason score reported here. The example given uses "major+minor=sum" format, but since there's no actual result provided in the text, Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the text is a preliminary report without conclusive findings. The structured JSON should reflect that with "NA" for each key.
