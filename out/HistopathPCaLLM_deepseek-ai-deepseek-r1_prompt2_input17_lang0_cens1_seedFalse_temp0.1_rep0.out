Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples mentioned are processed through standard procedures, and there's mention of prostate tissue sites. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It refers to "prepared samples" and "prostate tissue sites," but without a clear indication of the sample type. So, I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are being assessed to see if they're present or if the material is fully healthy. However, there's no definitive statement confirming the presence of malignant tumors. It's more about an upcoming assessment. So, since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 are being assessed but not reported as found, the Gleason field should be NA. Even though they mention assessing between 3 to 5, there's no actual Gleason score provided in the report yet. It's part of a future assignment for residents.

Putting it all together, all three fields should be NA because the text is a preliminary report without conclusive findings. The actual assessment is pending, so there's no confirmed data to extract.
