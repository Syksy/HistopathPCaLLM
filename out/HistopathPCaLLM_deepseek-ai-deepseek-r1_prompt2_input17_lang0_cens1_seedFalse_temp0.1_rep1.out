Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples mentioned are processed through standard procedures, and they refer to different parts of the prostate (right side, left side, samples A-D, etc.). The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" but doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. There's no indication of the sample type like "biopsy" or "prostatectomy". So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text talks about assessing differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's part of a future assessment by residents. It says "if the material is fully healthy" which suggests that currently, there's no confirmation of malignancy. The report is preliminary, and the actual assessment is pending. So there's no clear mention of malignant findings here. Hence, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example format is major+minor=sum. The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5 are being considered but it's part of what needs to be assessed. There's no specific Gleason score reported here, like 4+3=7. Since the assessment is pending and no actual tumor is confirmed, the Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the text doesn't provide definitive information on sample type, malignancy, or a specific Gleason score. The references to Gleason are part of a future assessment, not current findings.
