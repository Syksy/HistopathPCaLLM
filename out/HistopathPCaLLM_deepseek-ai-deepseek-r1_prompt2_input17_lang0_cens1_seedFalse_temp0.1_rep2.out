Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "prepared samples" processed through standard procedures. The text talks about the prostate's right and left sides and different sample labels (A-D, E-F, etc.), but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions assessing differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's part of a hypothetical scenario for a course session. There's no definitive statement about the presence of malignant tumors. Words like "whether... are at all present" and "preliminary report" suggest no conclusion has been made. So Malignancy is NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses "major+minor=sum" format. The text mentions Gleason grades 3 to 5 in the context of an assessment to be done, not an actual finding. Since there's no confirmed Gleason score reported, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the text is a preliminary report without conclusive findings.
