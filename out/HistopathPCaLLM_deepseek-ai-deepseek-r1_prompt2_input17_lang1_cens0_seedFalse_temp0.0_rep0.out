Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is RP, so that's the sample type. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The report says "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Also mentions "kasvain infiltroi selvästi kapselin läpi rasvaan" (tumor clearly infiltrates through the capsule into fat). These are malignant findings. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the requirement is to report the major and minor components as "major+minor=sum". The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions multiple foci but specifies the dominant grade as 4 with some 3, so that's the primary pattern. The other areas (apex and seminal vesicles) are clean, so the main findings are in the base. Perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension are present but don't affect Gleason scoring here.

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatetomiapreparaatti" is indeed RP. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of adenocarcinoma. Gleason is correctly formatted as 4+3=7. All fields are accounted for, no NAs needed here.
