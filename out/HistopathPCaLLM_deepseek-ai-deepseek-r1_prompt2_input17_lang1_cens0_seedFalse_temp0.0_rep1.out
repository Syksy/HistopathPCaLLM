Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So that's RP. The example given uses "biopsy" when the text says "biopsiasta", so here "prostatetomiapreparaatti" should correspond to RP.

Next, malignancy. The report says "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades, which indicates malignancy. So "kyllä" (yes).

Gleason score: The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary is 4, secondary 3, so sum is 7. The format should be "4+3=7".

Check for any issues. The sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is present. Gleason is correctly noted. No nested structures, just the three fields. All seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
