Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" is Finnish for prostatectomy, which in English is often referred to as RP (radical prostatectomy). So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3. Since Gleason grading is only for malignancies, this confirms malignancy is present. So "kyllä" (yes) for the malignancy field.

For Gleason grade, the text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". The primary (major) is 4, minor is 3. The sum is 4+3=7. So the format should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses the major and minor components correctly. Also, the sample type is correctly identified as RP, not biopsy or TURP. The malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is properly formatted. All other parts like perineural invasion or seminal vesicles being clean don't affect these specific fields. So the final JSON should have those three keys with the extracted values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
