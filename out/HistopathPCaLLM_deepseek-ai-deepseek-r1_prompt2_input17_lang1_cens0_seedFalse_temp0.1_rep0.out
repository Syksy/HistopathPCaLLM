Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti". I know "prostatetomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report talks about "selkeä fokus" with Gleason grades 4 and 3, and mentions invasion into fat. That's definitely malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format is major+minor=sum. The text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3". So major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The format should be "4+3=7".

Check if there are multiple lesions, but the instructions say to take the worst. Here, the main is 4+3=7, which is the highest. No other higher grades mentioned. So Gleason is "4+3=7".

No nested structures, just the three fields. All values are present and valid. No need for NA here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
