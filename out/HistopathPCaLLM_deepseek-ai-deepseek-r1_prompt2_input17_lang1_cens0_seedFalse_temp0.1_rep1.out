Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "prostatetomiapreparaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "useampi selkeä fokus" (several clear foci) with Gleason grades 4 and 3, which are cancerous. Also, terms like "kasvain infiltroi selvästi kapselin lävi rasvaan" (tumor clearly infiltrates through the capsule into fat) indicate malignancy. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3." The primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, so the sum is 4+3=7. The correct format is "4+3=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The sample type is RP, malignancy is confirmed, and Gleason is 4+3=7. All other details like perineural invasion or seminal vesicles being clean don't affect these specific fields. So the JSON should reflect these three points accurately.
