Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, identifying the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Ajetaan prostatetomiapreparaatti normaalin kaavan mukaan..." which translates to "A prostatectomy specimen is processed according to the normal protocol..." So, prostatectomy would be RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "useampi selkeä fokus, joissa vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4..." which means several clear foci with predominant Gleason grade 4. Since Gleason grading is for cancer, this indicates malignancy. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format is major+minor=sum. The report states "vallitseva Gleason luokka on 4 ja mukana myös jonkin verran luokkaa 3" meaning predominant grade 4 and some grade 3. So major is 4, minor 3, sum 7. The format should be "4+3=7".

I need to check if there are any other Gleason mentions, but the instruction says to take the worst lesion. Here, the main is 4+3=7. Also, the sample type is RP, which is correct. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is present, so no NA there. The JSON should have these values without nested structures. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
