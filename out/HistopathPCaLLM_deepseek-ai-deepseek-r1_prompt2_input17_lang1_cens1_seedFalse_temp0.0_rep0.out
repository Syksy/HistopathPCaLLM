Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin" which translates to standard routine procedures. The samples are labeled A-D, E-F, G-N, etc., but there's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about "prostatan kudoskohdetta" (prostate tissue samples), but without specifying the method. So, I think Sampletype should be NA since it's not explicitly stated.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions evaluating differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5, but it says "onko niitä ollenkaan läsnä vai onko materiaali täysin normaalia" (whether they are present at all or if the material is completely normal). This suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed yet; it's pending further evaluation by specialists. So, there's no clear indication of malignancy present. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The format is major+minor=sum. The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 and 5, but it's part of an evaluation that's left for specialists next week. There's no actual reported Gleason score here. So, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, none of the fields have explicit data. The report is preliminary and defers conclusions to a later time. So all values are NA.
