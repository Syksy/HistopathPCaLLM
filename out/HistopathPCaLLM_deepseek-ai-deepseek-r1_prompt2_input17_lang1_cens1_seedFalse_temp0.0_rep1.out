Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample mentions "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin" and refers to different parts of the prostate being marked. There's mention of "prostatan kudoskohdetta" (prostate tissue samples), but it doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. The text talks about samples labeled A-D, E-F, G-N, etc., which might be from a surgical specimen, but it's not clear. Since there's no explicit mention of the procedure type, I should mark Sampletype as NA.

Next, malignancy. The report mentions evaluating differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5, asking if they are present or if the material is normal. However, it states that the actual assessment is left to specialists in an upcoming session. There's no confirmation of malignancy here; it's just a preliminary report. So Malignancy should be NA because it's not confirmed yet.

For Gleason score, since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the evaluation is pending, there's no reported Gleason sum. The text mentions a range but no specific values. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all fields are NA because the necessary information isn't explicitly confirmed in the report.
