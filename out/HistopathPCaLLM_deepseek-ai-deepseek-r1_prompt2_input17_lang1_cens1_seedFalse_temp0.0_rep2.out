Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided example and the given text carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was a biopsy, so I need to look for keywords indicating the sample type. The current text mentions "Valmistellut näytteet" which translates to prepared samples, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about processing samples from the right and left sides of the prostate, but it doesn't specify the procedure type. So Sampletype is probably NA here.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions assessing differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5, but it says that the evaluation is left to specialists in next week's session. There's no clear statement of malignancy being present or absent. So Malignancy should be NA since it's not confirmed yet.

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report states that the evaluation is pending, there's no Gleason score provided. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not determined yet. Gleason is NA because there's no reported score. The example given for a non-sensical report also uses NA for all fields, which seems similar to this case where the necessary information isn't present.
