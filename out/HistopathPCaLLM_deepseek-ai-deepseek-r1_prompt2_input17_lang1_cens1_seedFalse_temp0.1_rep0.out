Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin" and refers to different parts of the prostate being marked. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about samples A-N and O, but these seem to be parts of the prostate rather than indicating the procedure type. So, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions assessing differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 and 5, but it's part of a future evaluation by specialists. There's no confirmation of malignancy present in the current sample. The text states that the assessment is left for next week's session. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy found, Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the report mentions that the evaluation is pending and will be added later. Even though there's a reference to Gleason grades 3 to 5, there's no actual reported score here. The example given in the instructions shows that if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is "NA". Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. Since the current report doesn't provide conclusive findings, all fields remain "NA".
