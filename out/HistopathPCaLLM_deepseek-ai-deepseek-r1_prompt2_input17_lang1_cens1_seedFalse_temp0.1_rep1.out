Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin" and talks about different parts of the prostate being marked. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text refers to "näytteet A-D" and others, but without specific terms like "biopsia" or any surgery types. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions evaluating differentiation grades from Gleason 3 to 5, which suggests looking for cancer. However, the text states that the actual assessment is left to specialists in an upcoming session. There's no confirmation of malignancy present; it's just a preliminary report. So Malignancy should be NA since it's not confirmed yet.

For Gleason score, since malignancy isn't confirmed and the evaluation is pending, there's no reported Gleason grade. The mention of Gleason 3-5 is part of what needs to be assessed, not a result. Hence, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, all fields should be NA because the report is preliminary and doesn't confirm any findings yet.
