Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided example and the specific input text carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prosessoidaan standardirutiinin proseduurin mukaisesti" and talks about different parts of the prostate being sampled (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O). But there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example where it's unclear uses NA. So here, since the text doesn't specify the sample type, I should put NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says they can assess differentiation grades for Gleason between 3 to 5, but it's mentioned that the evaluation is left to specialists in next week's session. There's no clear statement of malignancy being present or absent. The example without a clear statement uses NA. So here, malignancy is NA.

For Gleason score, it's required only if malignancy is present. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the report mentions that the assessment is pending, there's no Gleason reported yet. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all fields would be NA because the report is preliminary and doesn't provide definitive findings yet.
