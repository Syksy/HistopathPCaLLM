Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure..." Hmm, "shaving procedure" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a common procedure for removing prostate tissue, especially in cases of BPH. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Wait, Gleason is typically reported as major + minor = sum. The larger fraction would be the major pattern. If the larger part is 3, but the sum is 7, then the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the way it's phrased here is a bit confusing. The user wants "major+minor=sum" as the format. The text says "Gleason sum 7" and mentions the larger fraction is stage 3. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the order is based on the most predominant pattern. If the larger fraction is 3, that's the major, and the minor would be 4. So 3+4=7. That makes sense. So the correct Gleason format here is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no higher grade mentioned. The text only mentions Gleason sum 7 here, so that's the most severe.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 3+4=7

I should check if there's any ambiguity. The procedure is a shaving procedure, which aligns with TURP. Carcinoma is malignant. The Gleason sum is clearly stated. No other lesions mentioned, so this is the most severe one.
