Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement: "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure..." Hmm, "shaving procedure" makes me think of TURP, which stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. Biopsy is usually when they take a sample with a needle, and RP is radical prostatectomy. Since TURP involves removing tissue from the prostate via the urethra, especially for benign enlargement, but here they mention chippings, which aligns with TURP. So Sampletype should be TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, Gleason grade. The example uses "major+minor=sum". The statement mentions "Gleason sum 7" and "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60%". Wait, Gleason grading is based on the two most predominant patterns. The major (primary) pattern is the higher grade, and the minor (secondary) is the next most common. But here, the sum is 7. If the larger fraction is stage 3, that would be the primary, and the secondary would be 4 (since 3+4=7). But the way it's phrased: "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." So primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user said to report "major+minor=sum". The major is the higher grade, but sometimes it's the most extensive. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (primary) and the next most common (secondary), regardless of which is higher. But in practice, if there's a higher grade pattern even if it's less extensive, it might be considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if there's a tertiary pattern, that's a different consideration. But in this case, the sum is 7, with the larger fraction being 3 (60%), so primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP

Malignancy: yes

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that the JSON is valid. Also, check if the example uses "4+3=7" as the format. The user's example had "4+3=7" even though the primary was 4. So the order is primary + secondary = sum. So in this case, primary is 3 (since it's the larger fraction), secondary is 4. So 3+4=7. That's correct.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
