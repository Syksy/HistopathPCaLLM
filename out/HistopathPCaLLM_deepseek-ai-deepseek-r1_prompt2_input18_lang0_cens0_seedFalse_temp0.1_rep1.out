Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure..." Hmm, "shaving procedure" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a common procedure for removing prostate tissue, especially in cases of BPH. So Sampletype should be TURP here.

Next, Malignancy. The text mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

Now, Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Wait, stage 3 here might be confusing. Gleason grading is about patterns, not stages. But "larger fraction" would be the major pattern. If the sum is 7 and the major is 3, then minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). But the way it's phrased: "the larger fraction with stage 3" – maybe stage here refers to the Gleason pattern. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum 7. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the order is major + minor. If the larger fraction is pattern 3, that would be the major component. So 3+4=7. But sometimes higher grade is considered major even if it's smaller. Wait, no, the major component is the higher grade. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (major) and the next most common (minor). But if there's a higher grade, even if it's less in quantity, it might still be considered. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check: The Gleason score is the sum of the most prevalent grade and the highest grade. Wait, no, actually, in the current Gleason grading system (since 2016), for biopsy specimens, the primary grade is the most common pattern, and the secondary grade is the next most common. If there's a tertiary pattern, it's noted but not added. However, in cases where the highest grade is less than 5% but higher than the secondary, it's still considered. But in the given text, it says "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." So 60% is the major component (grade 3), and the remaining 40% would be grade 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses "4+3=7" which is the same sum but different order. But according to the text, the larger fraction is 3, so primary is 3, secondary 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7".
