Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific data into a structured JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja", which translates to shavings or chips obtained from a procedure. The term "höyläys" in medical context often refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "nähdään karsinoomaa" which means carcinoma is present. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista". Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60%). But Gleason scoring is major + minor = sum. If the major is 3 and the sum is 7, then the minor must be 4. So it should be 3+4=7. But the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3", which might mean the major grade is 3. However, the sum is 7, so minor would be 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order matters based on which is major. Here, the major is 3 (60% of the tumor), but that doesn't align with Gleason scoring rules. Wait, no. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) pattern is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. But if the sum is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor would have to be 4 (3+4=7). But the way it's written here: "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" (the larger portion's grade 3) and the sum is 7. So that would be 3 (major) +4 (minor)=7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to make sure. The user's example had "4+3=7" when the text listed 4 and 3. So the order in the text might not always be major then minor. But in this case, the text says the major portion is grade 3 (60% of the tumor), but the sum is 7, so the minor must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7.

So the JSON would be:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
