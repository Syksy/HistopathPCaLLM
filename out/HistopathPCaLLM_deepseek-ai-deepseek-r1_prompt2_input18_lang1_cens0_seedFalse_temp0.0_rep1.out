Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The term "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shaving" or "from resection", which might refer to a TURP procedure. However, "höyläys" can sometimes be used in the context of a biopsy as well. But in medical terms, TURP is a specific procedure, so I need to check if "höyläys" here refers to TURP. Alternatively, if it's a biopsy, the term might be "biopsia". The text mentions "lastuja" which are chips or fragments, typical in TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Lastuissa pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." So carcinoma is present, which is malignant. Therefore, malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score: The report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, but the major component is grade 3 (60%)? But Gleason scoring is based on the primary (most predominant) and secondary (second most predominant) grades. If the sum is 7, then primary + secondary = 7. However, the primary grade is the higher one. If the major component is 3 (60%), then the secondary must be 4 (since 3+4=7). But the way it's phrased here says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which would mean the major component is 3, and the minor is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But sometimes there's confusion in the way it's reported. The standard is primary (higher grade) first. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. But the Gleason score is written as primary + secondary, regardless of which is more extensive. Wait, no, actually, the primary grade is the one that is most predominant, and the secondary is the next, even if it's a lower grade. Wait, no, I think the Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (primary) and the highest grade (if there's a higher grade present, even if less common). Wait, no, I need to recall the correct Gleason scoring rules. 

Wait, the current Gleason grading system (since 2016) uses the Grade Groups, but the score is still the sum of the most common and the highest grade. For example, if the tumor has mostly grade 3 and some grade 4, the score is 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). If it's mostly grade 4 and some grade 3, it's 4+3=7 (Grade Group 3). So the order matters. The first number is the most common pattern, the second is the highest remaining pattern. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. If there's a tertiary pattern, it's only noted in certain cases. So in this case, the report says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60%", which means the major (primary) component is grade 3 (60%), and the remaining 40% is grade 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the way it's written in the example was "4+3=7". So the order depends on which is the primary (most extensive) pattern. Here, the primary is 3 (60%), secondary is 4 (40%), so 3+4=7. Therefore, the correct format is "3+4=7".

But the text says "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." So the sum is 7, and the larger portion (major) is grade 3. Therefore, the minor must be grade 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP (since "höyläys" refers to TURP), malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
