Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shaving" or "from resection", which might refer to a TURP procedure. However, "höyläys" in medical context could also mean a biopsy technique. Wait, "höyläys" is sometimes used to describe a type of biopsy, like a core needle biopsy. But TURP is a specific surgical procedure. The term "lastuja" here refers to chips or fragments, which is typical for TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The text says "Lastuissa pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." The presence of carcinoma ("karsinoomaa") indicates malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score: The report states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component (suuremman osuuden) being grade 3. But Gleason scoring is based on the two most prevalent patterns, with the primary (major) and secondary (minor) grades adding up to the sum. If the sum is 7 and the major is 3, then the minor would be 4 (3+4=7). However, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which translates to "the larger portion's grade 3". But that would mean the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making 3+4=7. So the correct Gleason format here should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order matters based on which is the major component. In the given case, the major is 3 (60% of the tumor), but that's conflicting because if the major is 3, then the secondary is 4, but the sum is 7. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. However, in Gleason scoring, the primary grade is the one with the higher pattern, not necessarily the larger volume. Wait, no—Gleason scoring is based on the most prevalent (major) and the second most prevalent (minor), even if the minor is a higher grade. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern is the one that is most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if the highest grade (even if less in quantity) is present, it might affect the score. Wait, I need to clarify. 

In modern Gleason grading, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the second most common. However, if there are multiple patterns, the highest grade present (even if it's a tertiary) might be considered in some cases. But according to standard reporting, the Gleason score is the sum of the most common and the highest grade present. Wait, no, the standard is primary (most extensive) + secondary (second most extensive). If there's a tertiary pattern of higher grade, it's sometimes noted but not included in the score. 

In the given text: "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." So the sum is 7, with the larger portion (60%) being grade 3. Then the secondary would be grade 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the correct notation is 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem statement had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order is primary (major) first, then secondary (minor). So in this case, major is 3 (60%), minor is 4 (40%), so 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is important. In the current case, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major component is 3, and the sum is 7, so minor is 4. So the correct format is 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since "höyläys" refers to TURP procedure, which produces chips)

Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the sample type is correctly identified. "Höyläys" in Finnish medical terms can sometimes refer to TURP, which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chips. So TURP is the correct sample type here.
