Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shaving" or "from planing," which might refer to a procedure like TURP. However, "höyläys" can sometimes be used in the context of a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, "lastuja" means chips or fragments, which is typical in TURP specimens. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Lastuissa pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." Karsinooma is carcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade: The relevant part is "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60%). But Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. If the sum is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor must be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which means the major grade is 3, so it's 3+4=7. But the user's example uses "major+minor=sum" format, so it should be "3+4=7". But the text here states "Gleason summana 7" and the major is 3. So the correct format would be 3+4=7. However, the user example had "4+3=7" when the major was 4. So in this case, since the major is 3 (60% of the tumor), the minor would be 4, leading to 3+4=7. But wait, the standard Gleason scoring takes the most predominant pattern as the primary, and the next most predominant as the secondary. If the major component is grade 3 (60%), then the secondary would be grade 4 (40%), making the score 3+4=7. So the correct notation here should be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the sample type. "Höyläys" in Finnish medical context often refers to TURP, which involves cutting pieces (chips) from the prostate. So TURP is correct here. The malignancy is clearly present. The Gleason sum is correctly parsed as 3+4=7 based on the description.
