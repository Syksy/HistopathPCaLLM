Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided example, the term "höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja" is mentioned. The word "höyläys" translates to "shaving" or "planing", which in a medical context often refers to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. However, "lastuja" means chips, which are typically associated with TURP specimens. But wait, the example given in the problem where "Prostata biopsiasta" leads to "biopsy" as the sample type. Here, the text starts with "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja", which might be TURP. But I need to confirm. TURP specimens are usually described as chips or fragments. So, "höyläys" here likely refers to TURP. So Sampletype would be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "nähdään karsinoomaa", which means carcinoma is seen. Carcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista". Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, with the major component being grade 3 (60% of the tumor). But Gleason scoring is based on the primary (most predominant) and secondary (next most predominant) patterns. If the sum is 7, and the major is 3, then the minor would be 4 (since 3+4=7). However, the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" which translates to "the larger portion's grade 3". But if the larger portion is grade 3 and the sum is 7, then the minor must be 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But the way it's written here is a bit tricky. The user needs to make sure that the major is the higher grade. Wait, no. In Gleason scoring, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if the highest grade (even if less in quantity) is considered the primary? No, the primary is the most extensive pattern. So if the major portion (60%) is grade 3, and the sum is 7, then the secondary must be grade 4 (3+4=7). Therefore, the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's from höyläys, which is TURP)
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

Wait, but the text says "suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista". So the major component is grade 3 (60%), and the minor would be grade 4, adding up to 7. So yes, 3+4=7. That's correct.

I need to make sure there's no other Gleason mentioned. The text only mentions sum 7 with major 3. So the answer should be 3+4=7.
