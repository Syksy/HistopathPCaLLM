Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja ajettiin 12 kudosblokkia." The word "höyläyksestä" translates to "from shaving" or "from planing," which might refer to a TURP procedure. However, "höyläys" can sometimes be used in the context of a biopsy as well. Wait, but TURP is a specific surgical procedure. Alternatively, "biopsia" would be biopsy. The term "lastuja" here refers to chips, which are typical in TURP specimens. So I think the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Lastuissa pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

Then, the Gleason score. The report states: "Gleason summana 7, josta suuremman osuuden luokka 3 noin 60% tuumorista." Wait, that's a bit confusing. The total is 7, but the major component is grade 3 (60%) and minor would be grade 4 (since 3+4=7). But the way it's phrased: "suuremman osuuden luokka 3" meaning the major (primary) grade is 3, and the minor (secondary) is 4. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. However, the standard format is major + minor = sum. So the correct notation would be "3+4=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Let me double-check the sample type. The term "höyläys" in Finnish medical context often refers to TURP, especially when mentioning "lastuja" (chips), which are typical in TURP specimens. Biopsy would be "biopsia" or "koepala". So TURP is correct here.
