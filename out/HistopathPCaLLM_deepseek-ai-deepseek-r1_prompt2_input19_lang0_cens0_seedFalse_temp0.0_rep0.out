Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes." The other samples are unrepresentative or benign, but the instruction says to consider the most severe lesion, which is in sample 4. So malignancy is confirmed.

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum. The statement says in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most prevalent pattern as the first number and the next most prevalent as the second. However, if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, that might affect the sum. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. But in some cases, if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might still be considered. Wait, in the current Gleason system, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if there's a tertiary pattern (higher grade but less than 5%), that might be noted. But in this case, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. The user example had 4+3=7, but here it's 3+4=7. The order matters for the primary and secondary, but the sum is still 7. The answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user's example used "4+3=7" as the format. So the major is the higher grade? No, the primary is the most extensive, not the highest. So if the most extensive is 3 (90%) and the next is 4 (10%), then it's 3+4=7. So the correct format here is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and that the JSON is valid. Also, check that the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, that's the one we take. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative, so they don't affect the result. The answer should be as specified.
