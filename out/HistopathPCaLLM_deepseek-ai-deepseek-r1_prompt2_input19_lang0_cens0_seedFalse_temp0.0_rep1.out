Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text states that in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (next most prevalent) patterns. However, if one component is higher, even if it's less in percentage, it might affect the grading. Wait, no—the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next. But in some cases, if the higher grade is present, even in a smaller amount, it's considered the secondary. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the second most extensive. But in this case, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the user example shows "4+3=7" when the first number is the major (higher grade) even if it's less in percentage. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most common) and secondary (next common) patterns, regardless of which is higher. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is the sum of the most common grade and the highest grade present. Wait, I need to clarify. 

Wait, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the primary and secondary patterns. The primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next most extensive. If there are multiple patterns, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next, even if a higher grade is present in a smaller amount. However, if there's a tertiary pattern, which is a higher grade but less than 5%, it might be noted. But in this case, the report says 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7".

But wait, in the example given by the user, the statement had 4 and 3, resulting in 4+3=7. So the order is primary (most common) first, then secondary. So in the example, even though 4 is the major (higher grade), but if the most common is 4, then it's 4+3. But in the current case, the most common is 3 (90%), and the secondary is 4 (10%). So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. 

Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from the first sentence)
Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma is present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the one with malignancy, and it's the most severe, we take that Gleason score.
