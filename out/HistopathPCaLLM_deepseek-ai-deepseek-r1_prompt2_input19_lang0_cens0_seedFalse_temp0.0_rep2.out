Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it starts with "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy." That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there's a malignant tumor. The statement mentions "adenocarcinoma" in sample 4. Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." The report states that in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). So the major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7."

Wait, but the order matters. The Gleason score is typically reported as the higher grade first if they are different. Wait, no, the major pattern is the one with the higher percentage. Wait, no, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor), but if there are two patterns, the higher grade is listed first if they are of different grades. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern (major) is the one that's most prevalent, and the secondary (minor) is the next. But if there are two grades, the higher grade is the primary if it's more than 5%? Wait, in the example given in the user's example, it's 4+3=7, which would be if the major is 4 and minor is 3, even if 3 is 90%? Wait, no, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I need to check the actual rules. But according to the user's example, when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7," the structured data is "4+3=7." So the order is as mentioned in the text. So in the current case, the text says "larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)." So the major is Gleason 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%). Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7." But wait, in the example, the order is 4+3 even though 4 is first. So the user's example takes the order as mentioned in the text. So in the current case, the larger portion is 3, so that's the major, and the minor is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7."

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. The answer should be in JSON format without any nested structures. Also, the user mentioned to take the most severe lesion. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one, that's the most severe. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative. So the final JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
