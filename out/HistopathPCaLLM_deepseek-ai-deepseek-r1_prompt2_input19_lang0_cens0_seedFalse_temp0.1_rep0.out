Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first line says "targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely a biopsy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum. The report states in sample 4: larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, but wait, Gleason grading actually takes the most predominant pattern as the first number and the next most predominant as the second. However, if there's a higher grade even in a smaller portion, that becomes the secondary. Wait, no. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (next most extensive) grade. However, if a higher grade is present, even if it's less extensive, does that affect the score? Wait, no. The primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the second most common. But in some cases, if there's a tertiary pattern, which is higher, but in this case, it's just two patterns. So here, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%), and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the user example had 4+3=7. So the order matters based on the majority. So in this case, since 3 is the major (90%) and 4 is minor (10%), it's 3+4=7. But wait, the way the user example was structured, the higher grade was first. Wait, no. In the example given by the user, the statement was "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So the primary grade is 4, secondary 3. But in the current case, the primary is 3 (90%) and secondary is 4 (10%). So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But I need to check if the user's instructions require the major and minor as per the actual Gleason scoring. Yes, the Gleason score is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive, even if higher grade). Wait, no. Wait, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. If there's a higher grade that's less extensive, it's still the secondary. So in this case, the primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%), so the score is 3+4=7. But sometimes, in some reports, if there's a higher grade even in a small amount, they might take the higher as the secondary. Wait, no. The standard is that the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. So in this case, 3 is primary, 4 is secondary. So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. 

But the user's example had 4+3=7, which would be primary 4, secondary 3. So the order is based on the extent. Therefore, in the current case, the correct Gleason is 3+4=7. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. 

Wait, but the user's example had the higher grade first. Let me confirm. The example given was "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So in that case, the primary was 4, secondary 3. So the order is based on the grades, not the percentages. Wait, no. The primary is the most extensive, regardless of the grade. So if the most extensive is grade 3, then primary is 3, even if there's a higher grade in a smaller portion. So in the current case, the primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%), so 3+4=7. 

Therefore, the correct Gleason here is 3+4=7. 

So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The report mentions sample 4 as the one with adenocarcinoma, and that's the only malignant one. The other samples are benign. So the most severe is sample 4, which is what we're reporting. 

No nested structures, just the three fields. All values are present and correct. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
