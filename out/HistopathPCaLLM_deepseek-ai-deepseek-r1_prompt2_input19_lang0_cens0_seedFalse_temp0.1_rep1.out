Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, and I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered.

First, I'll look at the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The provided statement starts with "The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So, the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. That's straightforward. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants it in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. The statement says in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). The major grade is the higher one, but wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary (major) is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary (minor) is the next most prevalent. However, if one pattern is more than 95%, the secondary isn't counted. But here, it's 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. So the primary is Gleason 3 (since it's the majority), and secondary is Gleason 4. The sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the user example had "4+3=7" which is different. So the order is major (higher grade) first? No, actually, the primary pattern is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. So if the majority is 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%), it's 3+4=7. However, sometimes in reports, they might list the higher grade first if they are both present but the higher is less. But according to standard Gleason scoring, it's primary (most extensive) + secondary (next most extensive). So in this case, primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to check the example given. The example had 4+3=7, which would be if the primary was 4 and secondary 3, even if the percentages are different. Wait, in the example statement, it says "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So the order is as listed in the text. So if the text mentions "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%", then the primary is 3, secondary is 4, so 3+4=7. The example in the user's prompt had the higher grade first because the text listed them as 4 and 3. So the order in the Gleason score depends on the order mentioned in the text or the actual primary and secondary patterns. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most extensive, regardless of the order mentioned. So if the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%), that's the primary, and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%), secondary. So the correct Gleason score is 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from "targeted prostate biopsies")
Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: "3+4=7"

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one and has the highest Gleason, that's the one to report.
