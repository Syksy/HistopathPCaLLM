Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The original sample type needs to be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the statement, the first line says "The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So the sample type here is definitely "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement mentions that in sample 4, there's adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes". The other samples are either unrepresentative or benign, but the instruction says to consider the most severe lesion, which is sample 4 here.

Now, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The statement says in sample 4, the larger portion is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller part is Gleason 4 (10%). So the major is 4 and minor is 3? Wait, no. Wait, Gleason grading is based on the most predominant pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). But the percentages here are 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4. So the major would be 3, and minor 4, making it 3+4=7. But the way it's written in the example, the higher grade is sometimes considered the major even if it's a smaller percentage. Wait, no, according to current guidelines, the primary pattern is the most common (highest percentage), and the secondary is the next. But if there's a higher grade even in a smaller amount, sometimes it's considered. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, secondary is the next. So in this case, 90% is Gleason 3, 10% is Gleason 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So Gleason score would be 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem shows 4+3=7 when the higher grade is the major. Wait, in the example, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", resulting in 4+3=7. So maybe the order in the text matters. Let me check the user's example again. The example statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so the output is 4+3=7. So perhaps the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. In the current case, the text says "larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)". So the larger portion is Gleason 3 (primary), smaller is Gleason 4 (secondary). So the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the user's example uses the order as given in the text. So if the text lists 4 and 3, it's 4+3. In this case, the text lists 3 and 4, so 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

But wait, I need to confirm. The Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and secondary (second most extensive) patterns. So even if a higher grade is present in a smaller amount, the primary is the most extensive. So in this case, primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%), so 3+4=7. That's correct. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (from the first sentence)
Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since sample 4 is the only malignant one and the others are benign or unrepresentative, this is the correct one to report.
