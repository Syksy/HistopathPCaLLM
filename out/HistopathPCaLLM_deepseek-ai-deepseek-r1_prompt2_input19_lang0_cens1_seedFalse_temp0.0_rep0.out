Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are referred to as samples 1 through 4, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, and there's uncertainty whether it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal (possibly malignant). However, it's not confirmed; they need to verify a lab mishap first. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, Malignancy should be NA, not yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. There's a reference to possible malignancy but no specific grading. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields should be NA because there's no clear evidence in the provided statement for any of the required values.
