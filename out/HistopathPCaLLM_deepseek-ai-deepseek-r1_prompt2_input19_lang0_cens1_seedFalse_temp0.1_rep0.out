Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are referred to as samples 1 through 4, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, and there's uncertainty whether it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal (possibly malignant). However, it's noted that they need to verify if there's a lab mishap before confirming. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the Malignancy can't be definitively stated as yes. The options are yes, no, or NA. Since there's a suspicion but no confirmation, the answer here should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. There's a reference to possible malignancy but no specific grading provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is uncertain, and there's no Gleason grade mentioned.
