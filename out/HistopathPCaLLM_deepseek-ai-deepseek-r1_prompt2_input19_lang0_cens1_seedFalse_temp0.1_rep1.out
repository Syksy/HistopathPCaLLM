Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The samples are referred to as samples 1-4, but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal, but it's uncertain if it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal (possibly malignant). Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, there's no definitive yes. The other samples are benign. So Malignancy would be NA because it's not confirmed as malignant.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. There's a suspicion of possible malignancy but no grading provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the necessary information isn't explicitly confirmed in the text.
