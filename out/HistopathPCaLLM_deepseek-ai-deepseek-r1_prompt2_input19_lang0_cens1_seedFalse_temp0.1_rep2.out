Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." However, the specific type isn't mentioned. Terms like "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" aren't present. The samples are divided into batches, but there's no indication of the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions sample 4 has cell architectures differing from normal tissue, and there's uncertainty if it's mixed with non-prostate tissue or truly abnormal (possibly malignant). However, it's not confirmed. The lab is verifying to rule out mishap. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed as malignant, the answer here isn't a clear yes. The other samples are benign or unrepresentative. So Malignancy would be NA because there's no definitive malignant finding reported yet.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses "major+minor=sum" format. The text doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, there's no Gleason grade provided. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which aligns with this scenario where the information isn't definitive.
