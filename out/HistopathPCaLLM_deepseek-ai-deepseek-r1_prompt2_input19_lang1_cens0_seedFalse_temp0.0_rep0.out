Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". "Prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies, so the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report says in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes). The other samples (1, 2, 3) are either non-representative or healthy, but since we're only considering the worst lesion, which is in sample 4, malignancy is present.

For Gleason grade, the text specifies "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. So the format should be "4+3=7". Even though the percentages are 90% and 10%, the major is determined by the higher grade, not the percentage. Wait, no—Gleason scoring takes the most common pattern as the first number and the next most common as the second, but if a higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it's considered. Wait, no, actually, the Gleason score is the sum of the most prevalent grade and the highest grade present. Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up. The current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the most common and the highest pattern. For example, if the majority is 3 but there's a small amount of 4, it's 3+4=7. But in the text here, it says "isompi osuus" (larger part) is Gleason 3 (90%) and "pienempi osuus" (smaller part) is Gleason 4 (10%). So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. So the score would be 3+4=7. But wait, the example given in the problem statement had "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So maybe the order is based on the order mentioned? Wait, no. The correct way is that the first number is the primary (most extensive) pattern, and the second is the next most extensive. However, if a higher grade is present, even if less extensive, it's considered. Wait, no. The primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the second most common. So in this case, the larger part is 3 (90%), so primary is 3, and the smaller part is 4 (10%), so secondary is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. Wait, maybe in the example, the order in the text was 4 and 3, so they took major as 4. But in reality, the primary is the most extensive. So in the current case, the primary is 3 (90%), secondary is 4 (10%), so 3+4=7. But the user's example might have a different approach. Let me check the example again. The example sentence was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So the example uses the order mentioned in the text, even if the first number is higher but not the most extensive. Wait, but in reality, the primary is the most common. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but according to the problem statement, we should follow the text's order. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so the sum is 4+3=7. But in reality, if 4 is the primary and 3 is secondary, that's correct. But if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, it should be 3+4. However, the example shows that the order in the text is taken as major and minor. So in the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the first mentioned is 3 (as the larger part), then 4. So according to the example's logic, would it be 3+4=7? But the example used the order as written. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is used. In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the larger part) and then Gleason 4. So according to the example's approach, it should be 3+4=7. But the problem says to take the pahimman (worst) lesion. Wait, maybe the Gleason score is determined by the highest grade present. Wait, no. The Gleason score is the sum of the most common grade and the highest grade present. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: The current Gleason scoring (since 2016) uses the Grade Groups, but the score itself is still the sum of the most prevalent pattern and the highest grade present. For example, if the tumor has 60% pattern 3, 30% pattern 4, and 10% pattern 5, the score would be 3+5=8. Wait, no, that's not right. The standard Gleason score is the sum of the most common (primary) and the second most common (secondary) patterns. However, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. If there are only two patterns, it's primary + secondary. If there are three, it's primary + the highest of the remaining. For example, if the patterns are 50% 3, 30% 4, 20% 5, then primary is 3, secondary is 5 (since it's the highest among the remaining), so 3+5=8. But in the current case, the text says that the larger part is Gleason 3 (90%) and smaller is 4 (10%). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the score is 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is the same sum. However, in clinical practice, the order matters for Grade Groups. For example, 3+4=7 is Grade Group 2, and 4+3=7 is Grade Group 3. But according to the problem's example, the order in the text is taken as is. So in the current case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the major component) and then Gleason 4. So the correct sum would be 3+4=7. But the problem says to report "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher grade? Or major is the most extensive? The example in the problem statement has "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, implying that the first number is the major. But in reality, major is the most extensive. So perhaps the example is incorrect, but according to the problem's instructions, we should follow the text's order. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so the sum is 4+3=7. So the order in the text is used. In the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the order is 3 first, then 4. Therefore, the sum would be 3+4=7. But according to the example, the order in the text is taken as major and minor. So in this case, the major is 3, minor is 4. But wait, the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). So if the worst lesion has Gleason 3 and 4, but the highest grade is 4, then maybe the major is 4. But the text says "isompi osuus" (larger part) is Gleason 3 (90%), and "pienempi osuus" (smaller part) is Gleason 4 (10%). So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason score is 3+4=7. But the example in the problem statement used the order as written, not the actual extent. So perhaps the user expects us to follow the order in the text. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so the user's example uses 4+3=7. But in reality, if the primary is 4 and secondary is 3, that's correct. But if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, it's 3+4. However, the example shows that the order in the text is taken as major and minor. So in the current case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the larger part) and then Gleason 4. So according to the example's approach, it's 3+4=7. But the problem says to take the worst lesion's results. The worst would be the highest Gleason score. In this case, 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are both sum 7, but the Grade Group differs. However, the problem doesn't mention Grade Groups, just the sum. So regardless of the order, the sum is 7. But the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". So major is the higher of the two? Or the first mentioned? The example uses the order in the text. So if the text says "Gleason 3" and "Gleason 4", then the major is 3 and minor is 4, leading to 3+4=7. But if the text had said "Gleason 4 and 3", it would be 4+3=7. So in this case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the larger part) and then Gleason 4. So the correct format is 3+4=7. Therefore, the JSON should have "Gleason": "3+4=7". 

Wait, but the example in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is followed. In the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the order is 3 then 4. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7". 

But I need to confirm. The problem says "major+minor=sum" where major and minor are integers. So major is the higher grade? Or the most extensive? The example in the problem statement uses the order in the text. For instance, if the text says "4 and 3", it's 4+3. But in reality, the major is the most extensive. However, the problem's example doesn't consider that. So perhaps the user expects us to take the order as written in the text. Therefore, in the current case, since the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the larger part) and then Gleason 4, the sum is 3+4=7. 

So the final JSON would be:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's prostatabiopsiat)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinoomaa is malignant)
Gleason: 3+4=7

But wait, the example in the problem statement had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is followed. In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 3 first, then 4. So the order is 3+4. But in reality, the major is the most extensive, which is 3, and minor is 4. So the sum is correct. Therefore, the answer is 3+4=7.
