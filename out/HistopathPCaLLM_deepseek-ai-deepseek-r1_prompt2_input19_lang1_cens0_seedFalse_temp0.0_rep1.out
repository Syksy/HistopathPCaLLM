Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". "Prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies, so the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report says "näytteessä 4 nähdään... adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text specifies "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, the worst is in sample 4 with Gleason 4 and 3. The other samples are either non-representative or benign, so they don't affect the result. 

Check if all fields are correctly mapped. Sampletype: biopsy. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+3=7. Looks good. No issues with the example given. The answer should be in the specified JSON format without any extra nesting.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
