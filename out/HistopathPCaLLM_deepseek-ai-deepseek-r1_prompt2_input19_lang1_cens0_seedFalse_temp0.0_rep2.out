Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". "Prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies, so the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report says in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignancy. So "kyllä" (yes) for malignancy. The other samples are either non-representative or show healthy tissue, but the worst lesion is considered, which is sample 4 with cancer.

For Gleason grade, the text mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. So the format should be "4+3=7". Even though 3 is the majority, the highest grade determines the major component. Wait, no, Gleason scoring takes the most prevalent high grade. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next highest. Wait, no, I think I might be confused here. Wait, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) grade and the secondary (highest remaining) grade. So if the majority is grade 3 (90%) and a smaller part is grade 4 (10%), the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making the score 3+4=7. But the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the major is 3, minor is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. But in the example given earlier, the user had a case where the major was 4 and minor 3, leading to 4+3=7. Wait, but according to Gleason scoring, the primary is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next highest. So if the majority is 3 and a smaller part is 4, the score is 3+4=7. However, in some cases, when the higher grade is present even in a smaller amount, it might be considered the major? Wait, no. The primary is the most extensive, even if it's lower grade. Wait, no, I think I need to check. 

Wait, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) considers the primary as the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary as the next highest. So if the tumor has 90% pattern 3 and 10% pattern 4, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. However, in some older systems, the highest grade might be considered first if it's more than a certain percentage, but I think the standard is primary (most extensive) + secondary (next highest). So in this case, the primary is 3, secondary 4, so 3+4=7. But the example given in the user's prompt had "4+3=7" when the major was 4 and minor 3. So perhaps the user's system expects that the major is the higher grade, even if it's less in quantity. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the example again. The example given by the user was: "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So in the example, even though the order in the text is 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3=7, which suggests that the major is the higher grade. Wait, but in standard practice, the primary is the most common, secondary the next highest. So if the tumor has 4 and 3, but 4 is the majority, then 4+3=7. If 3 is majority and 4 is secondary, then 3+4=7. But in the user's example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which is listed as 4 and 3, but the sum is 4+3=7. So perhaps in the user's system, the first number is the major (higher grade) regardless of the quantity. Wait, that's not standard. Maybe the user's example is a mistake, but I have to follow their example. 

Wait, in the example given by the user, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So the grades are 4 and 3, and the sum is 4+3=7, which would mean that the major is 4 and minor 3, even if 3 is the second mentioned. But in standard practice, the primary is the most extensive. So perhaps in the user's system, the major is the higher grade, regardless of the extent. But that's not correct. However, the user's example shows that when the text lists 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3=7. So maybe in their system, the first number is the major. But in the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the majority is 3, but there's a 4 component. According to standard practice, the primary is 3 (most extensive), secondary is 4 (highest remaining), so 3+4=7. But according to the user's example, if the text lists 4 and 3, it's 4+3=7. So perhaps in this case, since the text mentions Gleason 3 first (as the major component) and 4 as minor, the sum would be 3+4=7. But the user's example seems to take the higher grade as the first number. Wait, but in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so the order is 4 and 3, leading to 4+3=7. In the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%", so the order is 3 first, then 4. So according to the user's example, would that be 3+4=7? But the user's example seems to take the first mentioned as the major. Wait, but in standard practice, the major is the most extensive, not the order mentioned. However, the user's example might be indicating that the order in the text determines the major and minor. But that's not how it works in reality. But since the user provided an example where "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7, perhaps in their system, the order in the text is used, not the actual percentage. 

But in the current case, the text explicitly states that the larger part is Gleason 3 (90%) and the smaller is Gleason 4 (10%). So according to standard practice, the primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 3+4=7. But according to the user's example, if the text lists the grades in order, regardless of percentage, then in this case, the text lists 3 first, then 4, so sum would be 3+4=7. However, the user's example had the higher grade first. So perhaps the user's system expects that the major is the higher grade, even if it's a smaller percentage. But that's conflicting with standard practice. 

Wait, the user's example: "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." Here, the grades are 4 and 3, sum 4+3=7, which is correct in standard practice if 4 is the primary (most extensive) and 3 is secondary. But if the percentages were 90% 3 and 10% 4, then the sum would be 3+4=7. But in the user's example, the text just mentions 4 and 3, without percentages, so the sum is 4+3=7. So perhaps in the user's system, the order in the text determines the major and minor, regardless of the actual percentages. But in the current case, the text explicitly states the percentages. So the user's system might require taking the higher grade as the major component if present, even if it's a smaller percentage. Wait, but that's not correct. In standard practice, the primary is the most extensive pattern. For example, if a tumor has 60% pattern 3 and 40% pattern 4, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. If it's 40% pattern 4 and 60% pattern 3, it's still 3+4=7. The primary is the most common, regardless of the grade. However, if there are multiple patterns, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the highest remaining. So if there's 5% pattern 5, 95% pattern 3, the score would be 3+5=8. 

In the current case, the text says "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". So the most extensive is 3, and the highest remaining is 4. So the correct Gleason sum is 3+4=7. But according to the user's example, if the text lists 4 and 3, the sum is 4+3=7, which would be incorrect in standard practice unless 4 is the most extensive. But perhaps in the user's system, the order in the text is used, not the actual percentages. However, in the current case, the percentages are given, so we have to use them. Therefore, the major component is 3 (90%), minor is 4 (10%), so sum 3+4=7. But the user's example might have been a case where the order in the text was used, but in reality, the percentages matter. 

So, given that the user's example uses the order in the text, but in this case, the percentages are provided, we should follow the percentages. Therefore, the correct Gleason sum here is 3+4=7. However, the user's example might lead me to think that the higher grade is listed first. But in this case, the higher grade is 4, but it's only 10%, so the major is 3. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. 

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's prostatabiopsiat)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinoomaa)
Gleason: "3+4=7"

But wait, the user's example had "4+3=7" when the text listed 4 and 3. So perhaps the user's system expects that the higher grade is the first number, regardless of the percentage. But that's not correct. However, the user's example might be indicating that. Let me check the example again. The example text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So the text lists 4 and 3, and the sum is 4+3=7, which is correct if 4 is the primary. But if the percentages were 90% 3 and 10% 4, the sum would be 3+4=7. But in the example, the text doesn't mention percentages, so the order is used. In the current case, the text does mention percentages, so we have to use them. Therefore, the correct sum is 3+4=7. 

But I need to make sure. The user's instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the format is major + minor = sum. The major is the primary pattern (most extensive), minor is the secondary (next highest). So in this case, major is 3 (90%), minor is 4 (10%), sum 7. So the correct entry is "3+4=7". 

Therefore, the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
