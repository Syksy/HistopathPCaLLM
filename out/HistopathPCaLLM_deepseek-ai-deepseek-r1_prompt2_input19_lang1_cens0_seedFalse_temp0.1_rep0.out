Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided example and the query text carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was "prostata biopsiasta" which translates to prostate biopsy, so the sampletype was "biopsy". Looking at the current case, the text starts with "Näytteinä kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat..." which means "Targeted prostate biopsies as samples...". So the sampletype here should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The example had adenocarcinoma, so malignancy was "kyllä". In the current case, the text mentions "näytteessä 4 nähdään... adenokarsinoomaa" which is adenocarcinoma. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. The example had 4+3=7. In the current case, the report states "Gleason 3, noin 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, even though it's the smaller percentage. Wait, no—Gleason grading is based on the primary (most predominant) and secondary (second most) patterns. But if the majority is Gleason 3 (90%) and a smaller part is 4 (10%), then the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, making the score 3+4=7. But wait, the way it's written here: "isompi osuus... Gleason 3" (larger portion) and "pienempi osuus... Gleason 4". So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. But the user's instructions say to take the worst (pahimman leesion) results. Wait, does the Gleason scoring take the highest grade as primary, or the most extensive? According to current grading, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. However, if there's a higher grade even if it's less, sometimes it's considered. Wait, but in standard Gleason scoring, the primary is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary is the second most. However, in cases where there are multiple patterns, the highest grade is considered if it's a significant portion. But the user's instruction says to take the pahimman leesion, which is the worst lesion. So in this case, the worst lesion in sample 4 has Gleason 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). So the primary is 3, secondary 4, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes when there's a higher grade, even if it's a smaller component, it's considered. For example, if there's 5% grade 5, then it's 4+5=9. But in this case, the major is 3 (90%) and minor is 4 (10%). So the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's prostatabiopsiat)

Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinoomaa present)

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested structures and only includes the worst lesion's Gleason. Since the example used the sum from the worst lesion, even if other samples are benign, here sample 4 is the only malignant one, so its Gleason is reported.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
