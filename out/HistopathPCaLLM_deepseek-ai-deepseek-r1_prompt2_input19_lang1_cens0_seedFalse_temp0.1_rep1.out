Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat". The word "biopsiat" is plural for biopsies. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's clearly biopsies, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says in sample 4 there's "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text specifies Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. So the sum is 4+3=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, sample 4 is the only malignant one, and the Gleason 4 is the major component. All other samples are either non-representative or benign, so we focus on sample 4.

Double-checking the example given in the problem. The structure matches, so the JSON should have those three keys with the correct values. No other information needed. All criteria seem met.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
