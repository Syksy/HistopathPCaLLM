Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat", which translates to targeted prostate biopsies. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's clearly a biopsy, the Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that in sample 4, there's adenokarsinoomaa (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The major component is the higher grade, which is 4, and minor is 3. So it should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. The answer should be straightforward. Also, only the worst lesion is considered, which in this case is sample 4 with Gleason 4+3=7. The other samples are either non-representative or benign, so they don't affect the result.

Double-checking the terms: "prostatabiopsiat" confirms biopsy. Adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. Gleason scores are correctly identified as 4 and 3. Sum is 7. All seems to fit the required structure.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
