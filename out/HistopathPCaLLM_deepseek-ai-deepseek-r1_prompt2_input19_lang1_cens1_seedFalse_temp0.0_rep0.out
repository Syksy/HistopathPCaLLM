Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." The key term here is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä," which translates to prostate tissue samples. But the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" for "Prostata biopsiasta." However, in this case, the text doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). The phrase "rutiisti käsiteltynä" means routinely processed, but that doesn't indicate the sample type. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should mark Sampletype as "NA."

Next, malignancy. The report says that samples 1 is non-representative, 2 and 3 are benign. Sample 4 has architectural abnormalities. The text mentions "mahdollisesti malignia" (possibly malignant) but also states that they need to verify if there's a mix-up or if it's truly malignant. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the presence of malignancy isn't definitively stated. The instructions say to answer "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. Since it's still in question, maybe "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example where malignancy was uncertain used "NA". Here, the report is questioning whether it's malignant or a mix-up, so it's not confirmed. So Malignancy should be "NA".

Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. The example without malignancy has Gleason as "NA". Since there's no confirmed malignancy here, and no Gleason provided, it's definitely "NA".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention and malignancy isn't confirmed.
