Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." The term "kudosnäytteitä" translates to tissue samples, but the specific type isn't mentioned. The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So Sampletype is probably NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions that sample 4 has architecture deviating from normal, and there's a suspicion of possible malignancy ("mahdollisesti malignia"). However, it's questioned whether it's non-prostate tissue mixed in or truly abnormal. They need to verify in the lab. Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, the malignancy can't be definitively stated as yes. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says "mahdollisesti malignia" which suggests suspicion but not confirmation. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since it's a borderline case and not confirmed, maybe Malignancy is NA. But the example given in the problem had "kyllä" when there was a clear mention of adenocarcinoma. Here, it's ambiguous. So perhaps Malignancy is NA here.

Gleason score. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. The example had a clear "4+3=7", but here there's no such mention. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because it's not mentioned.
