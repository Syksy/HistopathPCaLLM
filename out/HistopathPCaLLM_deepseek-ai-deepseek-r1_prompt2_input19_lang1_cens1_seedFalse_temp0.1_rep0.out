Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." The key term here is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä," which translates to prostate tissue samples. However, the sample types are supposed to be biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says they're processed routinely. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. The examples given in the problem had "biopsy" when it was mentioned. Since this report doesn't clearly state the type, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The report talks about sample 4 having "soluarkkitehtuureja, jotka poikkeavat normaalista" (cellular architecture deviating from normal) and mentions "mahdollisesti malignia" (possibly malignant). However, there's uncertainty: they question if it's non-prostate tissue mixed in or truly abnormal. They need to verify in the lab before proceeding. Since it's not confirmed, and the question is whether there are malignant findings, the answer here isn't clear-cut. The possible malignancy is noted but not confirmed. The options are "kyllä," "ei," or "NA." Since it's uncertain and not confirmed, maybe Malignancy should be NA. But wait, the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If sample 4 is suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? Probably not, because it's not confirmed. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" if all others are benign, but sample 4 is uncertain. Wait, the samples 1-3 are benign. Sample 4 is questionable. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer here would be NA. Because the presence of malignancy isn't definitively stated, just suspected but needing confirmation. So Malignancy: NA.

Gleason score. The report doesn't mention Gleason grades at all. The example had Gleason when it was explicitly stated. Since there's no mention of Gleason here, the value should be NA. Even if there's suspicion of malignancy, without a Gleason score reported, it's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because it's not mentioned. So the JSON should have all NAs. Let me check the example again where if the report is unclear, all fields are NA. Yes, the second example had a nonsensical report and all NAs. Here, the report is unclear on sample type, malignancy is uncertain, and no Gleason. So the answer should be all NAs.
