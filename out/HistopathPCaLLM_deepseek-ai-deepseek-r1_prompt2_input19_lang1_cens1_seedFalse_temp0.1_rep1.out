Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Näytteet ovat tyypilliseen tapaan käsiteltyjä prostatan kudosnäytteitä, näytetyypille rutiisti käsiteltynä." The term "kudosnäytteitä" translates to tissue samples, which could be biopsies. However, the text doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample type is described as routinely processed, but since it's not specified, maybe the answer here is NA. Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't use the word biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report says that samples 1-3 are either non-representative or benign. Sample 4 has architectural abnormalities, and there's a suspicion of possible malignancy ("mahdollisesti malignia"). However, they are questioning whether it's non-prostatic tissue mixed in or truly malignant. Since it's uncertain and needs further verification, the malignancy isn't confirmed. The instructions say to report only the worst lesion, but here the malignancy is not confirmed. So maybe Malignancy is NA because it's not definitively stated as malignant. Wait, but the example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, the suspicion exists but isn't confirmed. The question is whether "mahdollisesti malignia" counts as malignant. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since it's a possibility but not confirmed, maybe the answer is NA. Because the report is uncertain and requires further checks, it's not a definitive yes. So Malignancy would be NA.

Third, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. If malignancy is no or NA, then Gleason is NA. Since malignancy here is uncertain (NA), Gleason would be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores. They are still checking sample 4, so no Gleason is provided yet. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since no explicit type given), Malignancy is NA (possible but not confirmed), Gleason is NA.
