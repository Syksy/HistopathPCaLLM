Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." The term "samples" is mentioned, but it doesn't specify the type. It mentions "standard locations," but without terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP, I can't determine the sample type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The statement says the final results are inconclusive and additional inspection is needed regarding malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's inconclusive, there's no clear yes or no. So Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the statement mentions "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings," but it's not reported definitively. Since the results are inconclusive and require additional inspection, there's no specific Gleason grade provided. So Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no clear lesion described. The sample mentions mostly normal cells and inconclusive results, so there's no malignancy or Gleason to report. The JSON should reflect all NAs as per the example given for invalid statements.
