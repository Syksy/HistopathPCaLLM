Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." The mention of "standard locations" and "samples" is a bit vague. There's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy..." Since the results are inconclusive and they can't confirm malignancy yet, there's no clear "yes" or "no". So Malignancy should be "NA".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is inconclusive and they mention needing additional inspection for "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings", there's no reported Gleason grade here. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the statement doesn't provide definitive information for any of the three categories. The example given for an inconclusive statement also results in all NAs, which supports this conclusion.
