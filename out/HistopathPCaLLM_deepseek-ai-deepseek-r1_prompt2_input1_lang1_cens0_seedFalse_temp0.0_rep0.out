Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "neulabiopsiaa," which translates to needle biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "normaaleja rauhasrakenteita" (normal gland structures) and "benignin oloista kasvua" (benign growth). There's no mention of malignancy like adenokarsinooma or other cancer terms. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei" or "NA", Gleason is "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so "NA" fits here.

I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct, no nested objects, and using the exact specified values. Let me double-check each field. Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, Gleason NA. That matches the requirements.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
