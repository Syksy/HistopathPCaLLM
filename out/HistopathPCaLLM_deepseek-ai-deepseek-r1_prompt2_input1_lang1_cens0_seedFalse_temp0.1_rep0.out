Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana 12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." The key term here is "neulabiopsiaa," which translates to needle biopsy. So the sample type should be "biopsy."

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states, "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous. So the malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the requirement is to report it in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, otherwise "NA." Since the malignancy is benign, Gleason should be "NA."

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy mentioned, so all fields related to cancer (Gleason) are NA. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so straightforward key-value pairs are needed.

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "neulabiopsiaa" definitely refers to biopsy. "Benignin oloista" confirms no malignancy. No mention of Gleason scores because it's benign. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
