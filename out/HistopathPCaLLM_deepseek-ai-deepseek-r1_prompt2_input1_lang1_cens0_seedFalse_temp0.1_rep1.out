Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to fill are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." The word "neulabiopsiaa" translates to needle biopsy, so Sampletype should be "biopsy". That seems straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." Benign means non-cancerous, so Malignancy should be "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Wait, let me double-check. The text mentions "normaaleja rauhasrakenteita" (normal gland structures) and "benignin oloista kasvua" (benign growth). No mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason scores. So yes, Gleason is NA.

Everything seems to fit. No conflicting information. The example provided also uses "biopsy" for a similar term, so that's consistent. Malignancy is correctly "ei" because it's benign. Gleason isn't applicable here.
