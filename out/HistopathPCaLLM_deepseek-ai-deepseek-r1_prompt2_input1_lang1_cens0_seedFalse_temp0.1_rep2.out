Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields in a JSON format: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana 12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa prostatan tyyppipaikoista." The key term here is "neulabiopsiaa", which translates to "needle biopsy" in English. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states: "Lopputulos on siis lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua." "Benign" means non-cancerous, so there's no malignancy here. Therefore, the malignancy field should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason score isn't applicable. However, I should double-check the text to ensure there's no mention of Gleason grades. Scanning through, there's no reference to Gleason scores like "4+3=7" or similar terms. The report talks about normal gland structures and hyperplastic epithelium but no cancer. So Gleason remains "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and uses the exact allowed values. Also, confirm that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so no Gleason applies. Everything checks out.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
