Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The key term here is "prostatakudosta" which means prostate tissue. However, the report doesn't mention the method of collection like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "rauhasrakenteita ja jonkin verran aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" which translates to glandular structures and some wavy epithelium. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The conclusion is still pending: "Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken ja valmistuu lähipäivinä." So the report doesn't confirm malignancy. Hence, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the final conclusion is pending, maybe it's better to mark Malignancy as NA. Wait, but the question says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report doesn't state any malignancy and the conclusion is pending, maybe the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was found so far. But the report is not final. Hmm. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy. In this case, since the conclusion is pending and no malignancy is mentioned, perhaps the correct answer is "ei" or "NA". The instructions say if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. The example where malignancy was present had Gleason, and the other example with unclear text had all NA. Here, since the report is pending, but no malignancy is mentioned, maybe Malignancy is "ei" (no), but the user might consider it as NA because the final conclusion isn't ready. However, the text doesn't indicate any malignancy found, so perhaps "ei" is correct. But the report is not finalized, so maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The NA is probably for cases where it's unclear or not mentioned. Since the conclusion is pending, maybe the malignancy status isn't determined yet, hence NA. But the current findings don't mention malignancy. So maybe "ei" is correct. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The example where malignancy was present had clear terms like adenokarsinooma. Here, there's no such term. The presence of "rauhasrakenteita" (glandular structures) and "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" (wavy epithelium) might be benign. So Malignancy could be "ei". But the report is pending, so maybe the pathologist hasn't concluded yet. However, the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the current findings don't mention any, then "ei". But if the report is incomplete, maybe NA. The example given for an unclear report used NA for all. In this case, since the conclusion is pending, but the current findings don't indicate malignancy, perhaps Malignancy is "ei". But I'm not 100% sure. Let's check the instructions again. The user says to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report is pending, but no malignancy is found yet, maybe NA is appropriate. However, the example with the non-sensical text used NA. Here, the text is coherent but the conclusion is pending. The current findings don't show malignancy, so maybe "ei". But the final conclusion isn't ready, so maybe the malignancy status isn't determined, hence NA. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. I'll go with "ei" because the current findings don't mention malignancy, even though the conclusion is pending. 

For Gleason grade, since there's no mention of malignancy, it should be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. So even if there was a Gleason mentioned, but malignancy is "ei", Gleason would be NA. Here, since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

So the final JSON would be:

Sampletype: NA (since the method isn't specified)
Malignancy: ei (since no malignancy is mentioned in the current findings)
Gleason: NA (because malignancy is "ei")

Wait, but the user's example where malignancy was present had Gleason, and the other example had all NA. In this case, if Malignancy is "ei", then Gleason must be NA. So that's correct. But I need to confirm if the sample type is NA. The text says "prostatakudosta" which is prostate tissue, but doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype is NA. 

Yes, that makes sense.
