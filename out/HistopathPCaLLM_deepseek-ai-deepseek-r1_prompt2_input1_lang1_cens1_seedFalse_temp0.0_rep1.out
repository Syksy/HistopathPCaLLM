Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input is a free-text report, and I need to parse it according to the given rules.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista. Näytteiden yhteismäärä on riittävä..." The term "prostatakudosta" refers to prostate tissue, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample is just described as "prostatakudosta" from "sovituista paikoista" (agreed locations). Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions seeing gland structures ("rauhasrakenteita") and some wavy epithelium ("aaltoilevaa epiteeliä"). There's no mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or any malignant terms. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken ja valmistuu lähipäivinä"). Since the report is not finalized and no malignancy is confirmed, the answer here should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the report is pending, there's no Gleason score provided. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't determined, and Gleason isn't reported yet.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
