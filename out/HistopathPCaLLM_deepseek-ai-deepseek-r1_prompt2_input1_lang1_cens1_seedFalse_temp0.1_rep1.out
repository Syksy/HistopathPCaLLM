Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the original text mentions "edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista" which translates to representative prostate tissue from specified locations. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states they see glandular structures and some wavy epithelium, but the conclusion is still pending. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. Since the final diagnosis isn't ready yet and no malignancy is reported, Malignancy should be "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no indication of malignancy here, and the report is still pending, the Gleason score isn't provided. So Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example given for an inconclusive report uses "NA" for all fields, which fits this case. The sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and Gleason isn't mentioned. So the JSON should reflect all NAs.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
