Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittavana edustavaa prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista." The key term here is "prostatakudosta" which translates to prostate tissue. However, the report doesn't mention the method of collection like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified, hence "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions seeing glandular structures ("rauhasrakenteita") and some wavy epithelium ("aaltoilevaa epiteeliä"), but there's no mention of cancer or malignancy. The conclusion is still pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken ja valmistuu lähipäivinä."). Since the report is incomplete and doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "NA".

For Gleason score, it's required only if malignancy is present. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA". The example given shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, so that's consistent.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. Since the report is inconclusive, all fields default to NA. Also, checking for any possible typos or misinterpretations. The terms present don't indicate any malignancy, and the sample type isn't specified beyond prostate tissue. So the final JSON should have all NAs.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
``` 

**Rationale:**  
1. **Sampletype:** The text refers to "prostatakudosta" (prostate tissue) but does not explicitly state the collection method (biopsy, RP, TURP).  
2. **Malignancy:** The report describes benign findings (e.g., "rauhasrakenteita" = glandular structures, "aaltoilevaa epiteeliä" = wavy epithelium) and explicitly states that the final conclusion is pending ("Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken"). No malignancy is confirmed.  
3. **Gleason:** Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason scoring is not applicable.
