Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection..." Prostatectomy resection is typically referred to as RP in medical terms. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two areas: the apex with Gleason 3+4 and the basis with 4+4. The highest Gleason score here is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", which matches the 4+4=8 here. 

Double-checking the sample type: prostatectomy resection is indeed RP. Malignancy is confirmed by adenocarcinoma. Gleason highest is 4+4. All seems correct. No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is right. No conflicting information. The answer should be the JSON with those values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
