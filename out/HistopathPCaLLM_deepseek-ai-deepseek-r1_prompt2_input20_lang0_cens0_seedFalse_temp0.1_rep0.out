Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy resection is another term for RP, the sample type should be "RP."

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text states that samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The apex has Gleason 3+4, while the basis has 4+4. Between these, 4+4 is more severe. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum," so "4+4=8" fits. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
