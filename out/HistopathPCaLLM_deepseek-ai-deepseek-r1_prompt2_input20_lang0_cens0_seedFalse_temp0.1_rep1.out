Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy resection is another term for RP, the sample type should be "RP."

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text states that "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The text mentions two different Gleason scores: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher (more severe) one is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8."

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, without any nested elements, and using the specified allowed values. Also, confirming that only the most severe Gleason is reported. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum," which matches the 4+4=8 here.

No other parts of the text contradict these findings. The mention of surgical margins and capsule breach doesn't affect the three required fields. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as "RP," Malignancy as "yes," and Gleason as "4+4=8."

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
