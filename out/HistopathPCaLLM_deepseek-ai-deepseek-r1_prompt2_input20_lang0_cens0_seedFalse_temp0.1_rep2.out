Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "prostatectomy resection." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since prostatectomy resection is another term for RP, the Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text states "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to report the most severe lesion. The text mentions two areas: the apex has Gleason 3+4, and the basis has 4+4. The highest Gleason sum here is 4+4=8. However, the user specified to take the most severe lesion. Gleason 4+4 is worse than 3+4, so the correct Gleason should be "4+4=8."

Wait, but the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7" as the format. So the format is major + minor = sum. The basis presents mostly 4+4, which is major 4 and minor 4, sum 8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe is reported. The apex is 3+4=7, but the basis is 4+4=8, which is higher. So the correct Gleason is 4+4=8.

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatectomy resection" is RP. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is 4+4=8. All fields are present and valid. No need for NA here.
