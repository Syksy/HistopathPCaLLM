Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly stated. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions that even if a lower Gleason like 3+4 were found, the patient's situation complicates things. Since they can't confirm adenocarcinoma because of prior treatments, there's no clear malignant finding. So Malignancy would be "no" or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. Since the exam was impossible, maybe it's NA. But the user says "were there malignant tumor findings?" If they couldn't determine it, then maybe NA. But the text says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies" implying that even if there was, it's not detectable. So maybe Malignancy is "no"? Hmm, tricky. The example given for an invalid statement uses NA for all, but here the context is that they can't assess due to therapies. So perhaps Malignancy is NA.

Third, Gleason. The text mentions a hypothetical lower level Gleason like 3+4, but since they couldn't examine it properly, there's no confirmed Gleason. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy NA, Gleason NA. But wait, the user says to return the most severe lesion's results. However, in this case, there's no confirmed lesion. The text states that examination is impossible, so there's no malignancy found. So maybe Malignancy is "no"? But the example where the statement is invalid uses NA. Here, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user's instructions say for the most severe lesion, but if there's no lesion found, then Malignancy would be "no". However, the text says that even if there was a Gleason 3+4, it's hypothetical. So the actual findings are that they can't determine malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA. Similarly, Gleason is NA because it's not confirmed. Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. So the final answer should have all NAs.
