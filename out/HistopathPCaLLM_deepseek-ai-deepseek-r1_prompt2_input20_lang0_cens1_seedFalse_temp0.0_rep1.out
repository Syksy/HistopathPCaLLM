Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't explicitly stated. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions that even if a lower Gleason like 3+4 were found, the patient's situation complicates things. Since they can't confirm adenocarcinoma because of prior treatments, there's no clear malignant finding. So Malignancy would be "no" or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are yes, no, or NA. Since the exam was impossible, maybe it's NA. But the user says "were there malignant tumor findings?" If they couldn't determine it, then maybe NA. But the text says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" to examine, so maybe the answer is "no" because they didn't find any confirmed malignancy. Hmm, tricky. Let me check again. The text says even if a Gleason was found, but due to therapies, the samples are affected. So they can't confirm, so maybe Malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain. But the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If the report doesn't state any malignancy found, then "no". But the text says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" to assess. So maybe "NA" because the presence couldn't be determined. But the user's example for an invalid statement uses NA for all. Here, the sample is affected, so they can't assess. So Malignancy should be NA.

Third, Gleason. The text mentions a hypothetical scenario of lower Gleason like 3+4, but since the examination is impossible, there's no actual reported Gleason. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy NA, Gleason NA. But wait, the user's example where Gleason is mentioned hypothetically still uses NA. Because the actual finding isn't there. So even if they mention a possible Gleason, if it's not confirmed, it's NA. So yes, all fields NA.
