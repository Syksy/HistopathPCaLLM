Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from different regions. The term "tissue samples" might indicate a biopsy, but I need to check if there's a specific mention. The text doesn't explicitly say biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's unclear, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that examination for adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies affecting the samples. Even if lower Gleason like 3+4 is considered, it's hypothetical. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and the assessment is impossible, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason. The example uses "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Here, the text mentions a hypothetical 3+4, but since malignancy isn't confirmed and the samples are compromised, Gleason should be NA. Even if there's a mention of a possible Gleason, the overall context invalidates it because the samples are too affected to determine malignancy.

So, all three fields would be NA. The answer should be a JSON with those values.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
