Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from different regions. The term "tissue samples" is a bit generic. Biopsy usually refers to a sample taken, but RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. The text doesn't mention any surgical procedures like RP or TURP, just that samples were obtained. So maybe it's a biopsy? But the text also says that examination is impossible due to therapies affecting the samples. Since it's unclear if it's a biopsy or another type, maybe Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that examination for possible adenocarcinoma is impossible because the samples are highly affected by therapies. Even if there's a hypothetical mention of Gleason 3+4, it's speculative. Since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy found, and the actual assessment isn't possible, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason, the text mentions a hypothetical lower level like 3+4, but this is a conditional scenario, not an actual finding. Since no Gleason grade is confirmed, the answer here should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because we can't determine the exact type, Malignancy is NA because the presence of cancer isn't confirmed, and Gleason is NA because there's no actual grade reported.
