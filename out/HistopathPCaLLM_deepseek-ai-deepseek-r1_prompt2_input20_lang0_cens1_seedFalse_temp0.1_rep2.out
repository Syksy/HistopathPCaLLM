Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets..." but doesn't specify the procedure type like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP. So I think Sampletype should be NA here because it's not explicitly stated.

Next, Malignancy. The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given..." and mentions hypothetical lower Gleason scores but doesn't confirm any malignancy. Since they can't determine it, the answer here should be NA, not yes or no.

For Gleason, the example given is a hypothetical "3+4" but it's just a scenario, not an actual finding. The report states that even if lower Gleason were found, the focus is elsewhere. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, Gleason should be NA as well.

So putting it all together, all three fields would be NA. The text doesn't provide clear evidence for any of the required values. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion reported.
