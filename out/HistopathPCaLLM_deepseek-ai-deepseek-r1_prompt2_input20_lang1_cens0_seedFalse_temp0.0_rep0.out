Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti". "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. Looking at the allowed values: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. RP is the correct term here, so sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa." Adenokarsinooma is adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The report mentions two grades: "Gleason 3+4" in the apex and "4+4" in the basis. The worst is 4+4=8. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", so "4+4=8" fits. All other fields check out. No issues with the other criteria like margins or size since they're not required here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
