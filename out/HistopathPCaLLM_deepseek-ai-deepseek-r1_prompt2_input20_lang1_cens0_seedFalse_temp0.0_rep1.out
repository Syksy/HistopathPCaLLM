Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti". I know that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since "prostatektomiaresekaatti" refers to a resection from a prostatectomy, especially radical prostatectomy, the correct sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa." Adenokarsinooma is adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the report mentions two different scores. In the apex, it's Gleason 3+4, and in the basis, 4+4. The instructions state to take the worst lesion's result. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher sum is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", so "4+4=8" fits. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is the highest found. All other details like focus size or margins are irrelevant here. The answer should be straightforward.

  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
