Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The report starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti". "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" translates to prostatectomy specimen. In the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, which is the same as prostatectomy resection. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa". Adenokarsinooma is adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the example uses the highest grade. The report says "Apexin... Gleason 3+4" and "basiksessa lähinnä luokkaa 4+4". The highest here is 4+4. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The answer should be in JSON with the specified keys. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason 4+4=8. All seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
