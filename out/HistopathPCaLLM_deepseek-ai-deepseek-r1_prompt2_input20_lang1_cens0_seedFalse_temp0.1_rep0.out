Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the input text step by step.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to "The sample is a prostatectomy resection." The options for Sampletype are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Prostatektomiaresekaatti" refers to a radical prostatectomy, so RP is the correct value here.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa," which means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. So, malignancy is present. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. So, "kyllä" is the answer here.

Now, Gleason grade. The report states two different grades: "Apexin... Gleason 3+4" and "basiksessa lähinnä luokkaa 4+4." The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. Gleason 4+4 is higher than 3+4, so the major is 4 and minor is 4. The format should be "major+minor=sum," so "4+4=8."

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the highest Gleason score. Also, check that all values are correctly mapped. No issues spotted here. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8. That should be the correct structured data.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
