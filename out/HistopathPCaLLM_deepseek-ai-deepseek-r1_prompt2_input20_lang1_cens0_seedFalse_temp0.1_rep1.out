Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text starts with "Näytteenä prostatektomiaresekaatti..." which translates to "Sample is a prostatectomy resection..." So prostatektomiaresekaatti refers to a prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Sekä apexista että basiksesta otetuista leikkeistä löytyy adenokarsinoomaa." That means adenocarcinoma was found in both apex and base samples. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, Gleason score. The instruction says to take the worst lesion's result. The text says in the apex, it's Gleason 3+4, and in the base, it's 4+4. The worst one is 4+4. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8". The format is major + minor = sum. So the correct entry here is "4+4=8".

Wait, let me double-check. The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" as the format. So the user wants the major and minor components added together. In the case here, the base has 4+4=8, which is higher than the apex's 3+4=7. So the worst is 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The example also shows that if there are multiple, only the highest is taken. So yes, 4+4=8 is correct.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (from prostatektomiaresekaatti)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma found)
Gleason: 4+4=8 (the highest reported)

I think that's all. Let me check the original text again to confirm.

Yes, the apex has 3+4, base has 4+4. The worst is 4+4. No other Gleason scores mentioned. No mention of benign findings overriding malignancy. Margins are clean, but that doesn't affect malignancy presence. So the answer should be correct.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
