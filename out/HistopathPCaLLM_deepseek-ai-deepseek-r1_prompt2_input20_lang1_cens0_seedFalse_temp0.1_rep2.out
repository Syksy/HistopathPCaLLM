Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "prostatektomiaresekaatti," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, and "resekaatti" likely refers to resection. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that adenokarsinoomaa (adenocarcinoma) was found in both apex and basis samples. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so "kyllä" (yes) is the correct value here.

For Gleason score, the report mentions two different grades. In the apex, it's Gleason 3+4, and in the basis, 4+4. The instructions specify to report the worst lesion's result. Between 3+4=7 and 4+4=8, the higher sum is 8. However, the user wants the format "major+minor=sum". The basis lesion is 4+4=8, which is the highest. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the highest Gleason score. The other details like tumor size or margins aren't relevant here. Also, confirming that all values are correctly formatted as per the allowed options.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
