Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to prostate tissue samples. The text also mentions that the samples are divided into six parts from apex to base, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the type isn't explicitly stated, I should check if there are any clues. The report talks about samples being taken but doesn't specify the procedure type. So, Sampletype would be NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states that evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. It also mentions that even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, the patient's current treatments would be prioritized. Since the presence of malignancy can't be confirmed due to altered samples, the answer here isn't straightforward. However, the report doesn't confirm malignancy; it just discusses hypotheticals. So, Malignancy should be NA because the report can't confirm or deny due to sample issues.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. The text mentions a hypothetical scenario of finding Gleason 3+4, but since the samples are altered and malignancy isn't confirmed, the actual reported Gleason isn't present. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the report doesn't provide clear evidence for any of them. The samples are altered, making evaluation impossible, and the Gleason mentioned is hypothetical.
