Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the sample is mentioned as "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" (prostate tissue samples) and they are divided into different sections. The term "näytteet" (samples) is a bit generic. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about samples taken from different parts of the prostate, but without specifying the procedure. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text says that evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible ("mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta") due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. So they can't assess malignancy because the tissue is transformed. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since the presence of malignancy can't be determined, maybe Malignancy is NA.

For Gleason score, the report mentions a hypothetical situation where even a low-level Gleason (like 3+4) might be found, but since the samples are altered and they can't evaluate adenocarcinoma, the actual Gleason isn't reported. The example shows that if malignancy is not present, Gleason is NA. Here, since malignancy can't be assessed, Gleason should also be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because evaluation isn't possible, and Gleason is NA because there's no actual finding reported, just a hypothetical.
