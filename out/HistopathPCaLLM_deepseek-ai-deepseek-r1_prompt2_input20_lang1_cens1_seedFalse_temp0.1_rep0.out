Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task. The input is a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer, and I need to extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, it mentions "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" which translates to "The obtained prostate tissue samples." The term "näytteet" (samples) is a bit generic. But since there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), I might have to default to NA. Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, the text doesn't specify the sample type procedure, just refers to samples. So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" which means "evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" due to local treatments, and the samples are clearly altered. So they can't determine if there's malignancy. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. Since the assessment is impossible, does that mean malignancy is NA? The example where malignancy couldn't be determined also used NA. So here, Malignancy should be NA.

Gleason grade. The text mentions a hypothetical situation where a low-level Gleason like 3+4 might be found, but since the evaluation is impossible and the samples are altered, even if they mention a hypothetical Gleason, it's not an actual finding. So the actual reported Gleason here is none, hence Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, malignancy is NA because they can't assess due to altered samples, and Gleason is NA because there's no actual finding reported, just a hypothetical mention.
