Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the relevant part mentions "eturauhaskudoksen näytteet" (prostate tissue samples) and mentions that samples were taken from various regions like apex, middle area, and base. The term "näytteet" (samples) is used, but the exact type isn't specified. The text also talks about "näytteiden shiftailu" (shifting of samples) and mentions that the samples are clearly altered due to local treatments. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the type isn't specified, I might have to default to "NA" here.

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments altering the samples. It also mentions that even if a low-grade Gleason (like 3+4) were found, the patient's current treatments would take priority. However, the key point here is whether malignancy was found. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta" (evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible) because the samples are altered. Since they can't confirm the presence of malignancy due to the altered samples, but there's no explicit mention of malignancy being present, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. So, maybe "ei" (no) because they couldn't find any malignancy, but wait, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, not necessarily absent. Alternatively, since the samples are altered and evaluation is impossible, maybe "NA" is more appropriate. The example given in the problem where evaluation is impossible uses "NA" for malignancy. So in this case, since they can't assess due to altered samples, "NA" would be correct.

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy couldn't be confirmed (as per the previous point), the Gleason should be "NA". However, the text does mention a hypothetical situation where a low-grade Gleason (3+4) might be found, but this is a hypothetical scenario, not an actual finding. Therefore, there's no actual Gleason score reported, so "NA" is correct.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so "NA". Malignancy can't be determined due to altered samples, so "NA". Gleason isn't actually found, so "NA".
