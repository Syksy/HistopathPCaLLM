Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "Saadun eturauhaskudoksen näytteet jaetaan kuuteen pääsettiin yltäen apeksista, keskialueesta, aina basiksen alueelle" which translates to samples taken from different regions of the prostate. However, the exact type isn't clearly stated. Terms like "biopsia" (biopsy) or "prostatektomia" (prostatectomy) aren't present. The text refers to "näytteet" (samples) but doesn't specify the procedure. So Sampletype might be NA here.

Next, assessing malignancy. The text says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta johtuen paikallisista hoidoista" which means evaluation of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to local treatments. It also mentions that the samples are altered ("muuntuneita"). There's a hypothetical mention of a low-level Gleason (3+4), but it's in a conditional context. Since the actual assessment can't be made, malignancy isn't confirmed. So Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason score, the text refers to a hypothetical situation where a low-grade Gleason (3+4) might be found, but this is speculative. Since the report states that evaluation isn't possible due to treatment effects, there's no confirmed Gleason. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't specified, malignancy can't be determined, and Gleason isn't reported. All fields should be NA.
