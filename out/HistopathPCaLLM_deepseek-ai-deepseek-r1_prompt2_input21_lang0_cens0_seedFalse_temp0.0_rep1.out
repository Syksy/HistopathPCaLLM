Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input statement: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" might refer to TURP, as TURP often results in tissue chips. So I'll go with TURP for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The statement mentions "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue." Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grades (5 and 4) typically relates to cancer. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For Gleason grade, the text says "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." The standard format is major + minor = sum. So that would be 5+4=9. The user prefers the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers, so "5+4=9" is correct here.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses quotes around the values, so I'll follow that. Also, the user specified to take the most severe lesion, which in this case is the 5+4=9. 

Double-checking everything: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 5+4=9. All values are valid and correctly formatted. No NAs needed here since all information is present.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
