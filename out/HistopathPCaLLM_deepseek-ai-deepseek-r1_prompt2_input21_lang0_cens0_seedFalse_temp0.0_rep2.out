Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". Looking at the input statement, the first part mentions "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and the context of the sample being processed for histology makes me think of TURP, as TURP specimens are often referred to as chips or chippings. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and "tumor-like tissue". The description of nuclei being enlarged with visible nucleoli and poorly differentiated growth are strong indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text states "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary (most common) and secondary (second most common) grades. So that would be 5 + 4 = 9. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the example uses the most common and second most common grades, this is the correct approach. There's no mention of tertiary patterns here, so we stick with the primary and secondary. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

I should double-check that all values are allowed. Sampletype "TURP" is allowed. Malignancy "yes" is correct. Gleason format matches "major+minor=sum". No nested structures here, so this should be valid.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
