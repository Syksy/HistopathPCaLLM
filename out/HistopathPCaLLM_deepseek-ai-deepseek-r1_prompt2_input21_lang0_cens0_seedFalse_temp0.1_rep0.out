Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The original sample type can be "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". The input text mentions "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." The term "chippings" and the context of TURP, which involves removing prostate tissue in chips, makes me think this is a TURP sample. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text describes "poorly differentiated growth", "nuclei enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus clearly visible", and mentions "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth and nuclear atypia are indicators of malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grading (which is used for cancer) suggests malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text states "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no mention of multiple lesions, and the highest Gleason is 5+4=9, that's the one to report. Also, check that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the allowed values. All fields are present and correctly formatted.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
