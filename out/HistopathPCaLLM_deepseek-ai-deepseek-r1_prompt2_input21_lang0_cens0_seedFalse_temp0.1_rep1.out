Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

The original sample type: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings". From medical terminology, I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which often results in chippings or shavings. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Malignant tumor findings: The text refers to "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth is a sign of malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grades (5 and 4) typically indicates cancer. So malignancy should be "yes".

Gleason grade: The text states the most common is 5 and second most common is 4. Gleason grades are usually reported as major + minor = sum. So that would be 5+4=9. However, sometimes the order might be based on prevalence, but the highest grade is usually listed first. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary (most extensive) pattern is listed first, then the secondary. If the most common is 5 and second is 4, then it's 5+4=9. So the Gleason should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there's no higher grade mentioned. The text says "most common" and "second most common", so that's the primary and secondary. No tertiary mentioned here. So the answer should be 5+4=9.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
