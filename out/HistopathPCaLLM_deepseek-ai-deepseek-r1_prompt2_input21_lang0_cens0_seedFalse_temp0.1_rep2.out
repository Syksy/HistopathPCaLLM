Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three structured fields.

The original sample type: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings". From medical terminology, I recall that "TURP" stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which often results in chippings or shavings. So the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Malignant tumor findings: The text refers to "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue". Poorly differentiated growth is a strong indicator of malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grades (5 and 4) suggests malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

Gleason grade: The text states the most common is 5 and the second most common is 4. The Gleason score is typically major + minor = sum. So major is 5, minor is 4, sum is 9. Therefore, the Gleason should be "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum", so following that exactly is important. Also, checking allowed values for each field to ensure correctness.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
