Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "extracted prostate material totals several fragments" and "about half been put to histology." The term "extracted" might refer to a surgical procedure, but the exact type isn't specified. The mention of fragments could be from a TURP, which often yields fragmented tissue, but without explicit terms like "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," it's unclear. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement talks about stromal tissue and carpet-like growth, but then says the nuclei are dissolved and there's technical noise affecting assessment. There's no clear mention of malignancy like adenocarcinoma or tumor. The noise might be obscuring any findings. Since they can't assess differentiation properly, there's no confirmation of malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the report states that technical noise confounds assessment, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because they can't confirm due to technical issues. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar to this case where the data is inconclusive or obscured.
