Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece..." The term "extracted prostate material" and "fragments" might suggest a biopsy, but the description isn't specific. The text mentions "half been put to histology" but doesn't clearly state the procedure type. So, I don't see explicit mentions of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement talks about stromal tissue, carpet-like growth, nuclei being dissolved, and technical noise affecting assessment. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, tumor, or malignancy. The noise and issues with assessment mean that they can't confirm the presence of malignant cells. So, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no indication of malignancy, and the technical issues prevent proper assessment, there's no Gleason reported. Hence, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields should be NA because the statement doesn't provide clear information on sample type, malignancy, or Gleason score due to the technical difficulties mentioned.
