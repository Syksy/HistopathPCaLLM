Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically obtained from a TURP procedure. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua stroomassa" which refers to poorly differentiated growth, and "kasvainkudosta" meaning tumor tissue. These terms indicate malignancy, so the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported and no nested structures. The example provided uses the major and minor components directly. There's no conflicting information here, so the Gleason field is straightforward.

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because the mention of "lastuja" (chips) is typical for TURP specimens. Biopsy would be needle cores, RP is the whole prostate, so TURP fits here.

Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of tumor tissue and poorly differentiated growth. Gleason is clearly stated as 5 and 4, so the sum is 9. All fields are accounted for, and no NA is needed here.
