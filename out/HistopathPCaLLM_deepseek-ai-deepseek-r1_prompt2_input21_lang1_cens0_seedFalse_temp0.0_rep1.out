Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text starts with "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically from a TURP procedure. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua stroomassa" which means poorly differentiated growth in the stroma. Terms like "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) and Gleason grading indicate malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The correct format is "5+4=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 5+4=9. All fields are filled correctly without any NA values here.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
