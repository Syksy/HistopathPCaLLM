Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth) and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue). These terms indicate malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5, secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The correct format is "5+4=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum", which matches here. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is present, and Gleason is 5+4=9. All other details in the report don't affect these three fields, so they can be ignored.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
