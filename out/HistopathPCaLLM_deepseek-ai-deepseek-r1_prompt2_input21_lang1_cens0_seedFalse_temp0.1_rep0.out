Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips or pieces, which is commonly associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So the sample type here is likely "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth) and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue), which indicates malignancy. So "kyllä" (yes) for malignancy.

For Gleason grade, the report states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported and no nested structures. The example provided uses the format with the sum, so following that. Also, since malignancy is confirmed, Gleason should be provided, not NA.

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because it's about prostate chips from a resection. Biopsy would be needle samples, RP is radical prostatectomy, which isn't mentioned here. The text refers to "lastuja" (chips), typical for TURP.
