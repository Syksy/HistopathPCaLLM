Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text starts with "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth) and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue), which indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the major and minor patterns correctly. Also, since malignancy is confirmed, Gleason isn't NA. 

Double-checking sample type: TURP is correct because prostate chips are typically from TURP. Biopsy would be needle samples, RP is the whole prostate. The weight mentioned (19g) might be part of a TURP specimen. 

Everything seems to fit. No conflicting information in the text. All required fields are addressed.
