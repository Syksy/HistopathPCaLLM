Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." The term "Prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips or pieces, which is commonly associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Biopsy samples are usually smaller, while RP (Radical Prostatectomy) refers to the entire prostate being removed. So, Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua" (poorly differentiated growth) and "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue), which indicates malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the report states "Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." The primary pattern is 5 and secondary is 4, so the sum is 5+4=9. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "5+4=9".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The example provided uses the exact format, so following that. The sample type isn't biopsy or RP, so TURP fits. All criteria seem met, so the JSON should reflect these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
