Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale, josta noin puolet pistetään histologiaan." The key term here is "fragmentti" (fragments) and "histologiaan" (histology). This seems to describe a biopsy sample, as biopsies often involve multiple fragments. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so I'll go with "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua" (stroma and mat-like growth), but the nuclei are faded ("tumat ovat häiventyneet") and technical background noise complicates assessing cell differentiation. There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "adenokarsinooma" or "pahanlaatuinen". So, it's possible that malignancy isn't confirmed here. The report seems inconclusive due to technical issues. Therefore, malignancy should be "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since there's no explicit mention of cancer, and the report is uncertain due to technical problems, maybe "ei" (no) is not correct. But maybe the answer is "NA" because the assessment couldn't be made properly. The text says "hankaloittaa solujen erilaistumisasteiden arviointia" (difficult to assess differentiation), which might mean they can't confirm malignancy. So, "NA" might be more appropriate here.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores like 3+4=7 or similar. So definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is NA (since they couldn't assess properly), and Gleason is NA.
