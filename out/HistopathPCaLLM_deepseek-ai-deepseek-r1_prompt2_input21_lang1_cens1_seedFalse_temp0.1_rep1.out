Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti..." The term "fragmentti" suggests it's a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the original sample type could be a biopsy if it's fragmented. However, sometimes TURP specimens can also be fragmented. The text mentions "3/5g aina 8mm per kappale" which might refer to the size of the fragments. TURP usually yields more tissue, but I'm not certain. Since the example given for a biopsy uses "Prostata biopsiasta", and here it's "ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" which is extracted prostate material, maybe it's a biopsy. But if there's no clear mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP, maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, the text says "noin puolet pistetään histologiaan" which means about half is sent for histology. That might not directly indicate the sample type. Hmm. The sample type isn't explicitly stated, so maybe NA is appropriate here.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" which translates to stromal tissue and matted growth seen. However, "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical background noise complicates assessing differentiation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms. The example given for malignancy "kyllä" had "adenokarsinoomaa". Here, there's no clear indication of cancer. The matted growth might be suspicious, but without confirmation, maybe the malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" so if there's any mention, but here it's unclear. Since the report says technical issues make it hard to assess, maybe they can't confirm malignancy. So "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if it's uncertain, maybe NA. Wait, the user's instructions for malignancy are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't clearly state malignancy, but there's some ambiguous finding, maybe NA. But the example where malignancy was "kyllä" had explicit mention of adenocarcinoma. Here, there's no such mention. So perhaps "ei" or NA. Since the technical issues hinder assessment, maybe the answer is "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if the report is inconclusive, maybe NA. The text says "tumors are faded" and technical noise complicates evaluation. So they can't confirm malignancy. Therefore, malignancy might be NA because it's uncertain. Wait, but the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't state malignancy, but the assessment is hindered, maybe NA is correct here.

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades (like 3+4=7), and if malignancy is not confirmed, Gleason would be NA. The example where malignancy was "kyllä" had Gleason specified. Here, since malignancy is uncertain or not present, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so NA. Malignancy is not confirmed due to technical issues, so NA. Gleason is NA as well.
