Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the given input text carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali on kauttaaltaan useampi fragmentti 3/5g aina 8mm per kappale, josta noin puolet pistetään histologiaan." The key terms here are "ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" (extracted prostate material) and "fragmentti" (fragments). The example given for biopsy used the word "biopsiasta", which is biopsy in Finnish. However, here it's talking about fragments being sent for histology. Biopsy samples are typically fragmented, but so can TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimens. RP (radical prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate removed. The text doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP specifically. The term "pistetään histologiaan" might refer to taking samples for histology, which could be a biopsy. But since the sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe it's safer to put "NA" here. Wait, but the example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP directly. So perhaps Sampletype is "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The input text says "stroomakudosta ja mattomaista kasvua nähdään" (stromal tissue and mat-like growth are seen). However, it also mentions "tumat ovat häiventyneet" (nuclei are faded) and technical background noise complicating assessment. There's no clear mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "adenokarsinoomaa" as in the example. The mat-like growth might be suspicious, but without confirmation of malignancy, and given the technical issues affecting evaluation, it's possible that malignancy isn't confirmed. So maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the example's malignancy was "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, there's no explicit mention of cancer. The presence of growth might be benign. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy and the assessment is hindered, maybe "ei" (no) or "NA". But the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no clear malignancy, then "ei". But if the report is inconclusive due to technical issues, maybe "NA". The example had "NA" when the text was nonsensical. Here, the text is coherent but doesn't confirm malignancy. So perhaps "ei" if no malignancy is found, but the presence of "mattomaista kasvua" (mat-like growth) could be a benign finding. Alternatively, if the technical issues prevent proper assessment, maybe "NA". Hmm. The key is whether malignant findings are present. Since the report doesn't state any malignancy, just some growth but with technical difficulties, maybe the answer is "ei" (no), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the technical issues mean they can't determine, then "NA". The user's instruction says "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the report doesn't state any, then "ei". But if the assessment is inconclusive, maybe "NA". The example had "NA" when the text was gibberish, but here the text is meaningful but doesn't confirm malignancy. So perhaps "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" or "NA", then Gleason would be "NA". But if malignancy is "kyllä", then we need to find the numbers. In the input text, there's no mention of Gleason scores. The example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", leading to "4+3=7". Here, no such terms. So Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA". Malignancy isn't confirmed, so "ei" or "NA"? If the report doesn't mention malignancy, but mentions growth but with technical issues, maybe "ei" because no malignancy was found, but perhaps the technical issues mean they couldn't assess, so "NA". The user's instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state any, then "ei". But if the assessment is hindered, maybe "NA". The text says "tekninen taustahäly hankaloittaa solujen erilaistumisasteiden arviointia" (technical noise complicates assessment of differentiation). So they couldn't properly assess, which might mean they can't confirm presence or absence. In that case, maybe "NA" for malignancy. But the user's allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". So if the presence is uncertain due to technical issues, "NA" would be appropriate. Therefore:

Sampletype: NA (since no explicit type given)
Malignancy: NA (because assessment was hindered)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy confirmed)
