Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies from both side". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Biopsy" is clearly stated here, so Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The left side has "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth". The right side doesn't have malignancies. Since there's at least one malignant finding (left side), Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the left side mentions Gleason score 3 and 4. The example given uses "major+minor=sum" format. The higher score is 4 (major) and 3 (minor), so it should be "4+3=7". The right side is benign, but since we take the most severe lesion (left), Gleason is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are correctly filled based on the most severe lesion. The example provided uses "4+3=7", so following that format. The answer should be valid JSON with those three keys.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
