Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies from both side". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "Needle biopsies" clearly indicate the sample type is biopsy.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The left side has "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth". Carcinoma and cancerous growth are malignant. The right side doesn't have malignancies, but the most severe lesion is considered. Since the left side is malignant, the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason grade, the left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The major is the higher grade, so 4+3=7. Even though it's mentioned as "firstly" 3 and "secondly" 4, the higher grade comes first. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The left side is malignant with Gleason 4+3, so that's the one to report. The right side is benign, but since the left is worse, that's the focus. The JSON should have Sampletype as biopsy, Malignancy yes, and Gleason 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
