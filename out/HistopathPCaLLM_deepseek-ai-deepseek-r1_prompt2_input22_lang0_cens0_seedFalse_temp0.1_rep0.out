Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies from both side." The term "biopsies" here clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The left side fragments have "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "neural bundles surrounded by cancerous growth." Carcinoma and cancerous growth are indicators of malignancy. The right side doesn't have malignancies, but the most severe lesion is considered. Since the left side is malignant, Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the left side mentions "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." The primary and secondary grades are 3 and 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The left side is malignant with Gleason 3+4, while the right is benign. So the left side's data is used. The JSON should reflect these values without any nesting. All fields are filled, so no NAs here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
