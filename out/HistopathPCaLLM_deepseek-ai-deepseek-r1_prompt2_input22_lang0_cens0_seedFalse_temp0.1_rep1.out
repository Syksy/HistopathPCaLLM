Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both side..." The term "needle biopsies" clearly indicates the sample type is biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions that the left side fragments have "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and "neural bundles surrounded by cancerous growth". Carcinoma and cancerous growth are malignant. The right side doesn't have malignancies, but the presence on the left side means the overall answer is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The statement says "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4". So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The format should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure only the most severe lesion is considered. The left side has Gleason 3 and 4, which sums to 7. The right side is benign, so the left is the most severe. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. No nested structures, just a flat JSON. Also, check that there's no invalid info. The example given for invalid data had a lot of gibberish, but this case is clear. So the JSON should reflect those three values correctly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
