Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from the given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The statement starts with "prostate thick needle biopsies," so that clearly indicates a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" on the left side. Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes". Even though the right side doesn't show malignancies, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion, which is the left side here.

Now, Gleason. The format should be major+minor=sum. The left side has Gleason score 3 and 4. The usual way is to list the higher grade first. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. So Gleason would be "4+3=7".

Wait, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." Does that mean 3 is the primary and 4 secondary? But in Gleason grading, the primary (major) is the higher grade. Wait, no, the primary is the most predominant pattern, and the secondary is the next most common. But if they mention first and second, maybe they are ordered as primary and secondary. However, in the example given in the instructions, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3" resulting in 4+3=7. So maybe the order in the text is primary then secondary. Here, the left side fragments have firstly 3 and secondly 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. But according to Gleason grading rules, the primary is the most prevalent pattern. However, the example in the instructions took the first mentioned as major. Wait, the example given was "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as major and minor. So in this case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So first is 3, second is 4. But according to Gleason grading, the higher grade is considered the primary if it's present. Wait, no. The primary is the most common pattern. If the most common is 3 and the next is 4, then it's 3+4=7. But sometimes, even if a higher grade is present but less in quantity, it's still the secondary. However, the example in the instructions took the order as written. So maybe here, since the text lists 3 first and 4 second, the Gleason would be 3+4=7. But wait, the user's example had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as major + minor. So in this case, the text says "firstly 3 and secondly 4," which would be 3+4=7. But I need to check if the higher grade is considered the major even if it's mentioned second. Wait, no. The Gleason score is determined by the most predominant (major) grade followed by the next most predominant (minor). So if the first mentioned is the most predominant, then it's correct. The text here says "left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentiation... firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." The word "mainly" suggests that 3 is the primary, and 4 is secondary. So the Gleason would be 3+4=7. But in the example, the order was 4+3 because the text listed 4 first. So following that logic, here it's 3+4=7. However, sometimes in practice, the higher grade is listed first even if it's less in quantity. But according to the user's example, the order in the text is followed. So in this case, the answer should be 3+4=7. But wait, the example in the instructions had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as major + minor. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "firstly 3 and secondly 4," so the major is 3, minor is 4. So the Gleason is 3+4=7. But I need to confirm. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the higher grade is taken as major regardless of order. But according to the example, the order in the text is followed. So I should stick with the order given. Therefore, the answer here is "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is major followed by minor. So in the current case, the text says "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So first is 3, then 4. Therefore, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. However, in clinical practice, sometimes the higher grade is listed first even if it's the secondary. But according to the example provided by the user, the order in the text is taken as is. Therefore, the answer here is 3+4=7. But I need to check if the user's instructions have any note on this. The user says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". So major is the higher grade? Or the most prevalent? The Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the next most common (minor). If the major is 3 and minor is 4, then it's 3+4=7. If the major is 4 and minor is 3, it's 4+3=7. Both sum to 7, but the order affects the grouping. However, the example given by the user had "grades 4 and 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as major followed by minor. Therefore, in the current case, since the text lists 3 first and 4 second, the Gleason should be 3+4=7. But wait, the text says "left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." The word "mainly" here refers to low grade, which is Gleason 3. So the primary is 3, and the secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason score is 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".
