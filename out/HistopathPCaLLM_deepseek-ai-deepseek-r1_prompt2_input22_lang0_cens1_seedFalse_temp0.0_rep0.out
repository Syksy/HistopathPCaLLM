Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms "sampling material" and "fragmented" might suggest a biopsy, but the exact type isn't specified. The statement also mentions that the samples are highly fragmented and need reprocessing. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should probably go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This implies that malignancy wasn't determined, so the answer here should be NA. There's no clear indication of a malignant or benign finding; the assessment was inconclusive.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. The statement mentions difficulty assigning a Gleason grade due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for reprocessing. Since they couldn't assign a Gleason grade, the answer here is also NA. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because assessment wasn't possible, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be determined. The example given for an invalid statement also uses NA in all fields when information is missing or inconclusive, which matches this scenario.
