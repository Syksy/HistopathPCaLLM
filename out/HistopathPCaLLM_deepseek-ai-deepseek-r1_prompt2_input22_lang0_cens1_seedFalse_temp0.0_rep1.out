Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms "sampling material" and "fragmented" might suggest a biopsy, but the exact type isn't specified. The statement also mentions that the samples are highly fragmented and need reprocessing. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I should probably go with NA here.

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates that malignancy couldn't be determined from the current samples. So, the answer here should be NA because the assessment wasn't possible.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. The statement says assigning a Gleason grade is "exceptionally difficult" due to the wide range of cell architectures and the fragmented samples. Since they couldn't assign a Gleason grade, the value here should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because assessment wasn't possible, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be determined. I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. Let me double-check the example given for invalid statements to ensure consistency. Yes, in the example where the statement was invalid, all fields were NA. This case is similar because the samples couldn't be assessed properly, so all fields should be NA.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
