Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms like "sampling material" and "fragmented" might suggest a biopsy, but the exact type isn't clearly stated. The sample is fragmented and mentions both sides, but without specific terms like TURP or RP, so maybe the sample type isn't specified here. So Sampletype might be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." Since they couldn't assess it, there's no confirmation of malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the assessment was inconclusive, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions that assigning a Gleason is "exceptionally difficult" due to the wide range of cell architectures. They couldn't determine it, so there's no Gleason score provided. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because assessment wasn't possible, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be assigned. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here since the current statement is inconclusive and fragmented.
