Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and refers to samples from the left and right sides. The terms "sampling material" and "fragmented" might suggest a biopsy, but the exact type isn't clear. The statement also mentions the samples are highly fragmented and need reprocessing. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, I might have to go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." So, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the assessment couldn't be done, the answer here should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions that assigning a Gleason is "exceptionally difficult" due to the wide range of cell architectures. They also mention the samples might be contaminated and need reprocessing. Since no Gleason score is provided and the assessment isn't possible, the Gleason field should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it couldn't be assessed, and Gleason is NA for the same reason. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which aligns with this scenario where the data is inconclusive or insufficient.
