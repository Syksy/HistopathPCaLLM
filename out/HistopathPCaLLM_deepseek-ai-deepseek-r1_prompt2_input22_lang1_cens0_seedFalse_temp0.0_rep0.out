Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." The options allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. A thick needle biopsy would fall under "biopsy." So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says that on the left side, there are fragments showing "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (low differentiated carcinoma tissue), which is malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy. Since there's at least one malignant finding, Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary pattern 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The right side is non-malignant, so we only consider the worst lesion, which is the left side. The format should be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are direct. The example given uses "biopsy," "kyllä," and "4+3=7," so following that format. The right side's non-malignancy doesn't affect the Gleason score since we take the worst. Also, the sample type is clearly a biopsy, so no issues there. All fields should be filled correctly without any NA.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
