Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä", which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate". Needle samples typically refer to biopsies. So the sample type here should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that on the left side fragments, there's "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (poorly differentiated carcinoma tissue), which is malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy ("eivät näytä malignilta"). Since at least one side is malignant, the overall malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". The left side has mainly pattern 3 and secondarily pattern 4. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. The right side isn't malignant, but since we're only considering the worst lesion (left side here), the Gleason should be "4+3=7". The example given in the problem uses a similar structure where the worst lesion's Gleason is reported even if other samples are benign.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses a flat structure, so I'll follow that. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted. The sample type is "biopsy", malignancy is "kyllä", and Gleason is "4+3=7". The right side being benign doesn't affect the worst lesion's result. So the final JSON should have those three fields with the determined values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
