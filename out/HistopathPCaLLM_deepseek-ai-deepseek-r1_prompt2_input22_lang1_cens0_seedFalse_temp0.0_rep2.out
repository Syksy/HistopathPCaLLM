Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Needle samples are typically biopsies. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The left side fragments have "karsinoomasolukkoa" (carcinoma tissue), which is malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy. Since at least one side is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instruction says to report the worst lesion. The left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary 4, so 3+4=7. The right side is benign. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is taken. The example uses "major+minor=sum" format. The answer should be straightforward. Let me double-check the terms. "Gleason kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4" translates to primary pattern 3 and secondary 4. Sum is 7. So the format is correct.

No conflicting information here. All required fields are present. The sample type is biopsy, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 3+4=7. No need for NA in any of these fields. The example given in the problem matches this structure, so the JSON should follow that.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
