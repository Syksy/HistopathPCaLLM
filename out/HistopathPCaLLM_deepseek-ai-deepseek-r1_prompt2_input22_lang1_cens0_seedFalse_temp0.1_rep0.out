Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task. The user wants me to process a histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The input text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Thick needle biopsy is likely a biopsy, so the sample type should be "biopsy." The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's a needle biopsy, "biopsy" fits here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that on the left side fragments, there's "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa," which means poorly differentiated carcinoma. That's malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy ("eivät näytä malignilta"), but since there's at least one malignant finding (left side), the overall malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary pattern 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result. Even though the right side is benign, the left side's Gleason 3+4=7 is the highest, so that's the one to include. The format should be "major+minor=sum," so "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All three fields are top-level. Also, check that the malignancy is "kyllä" because there's at least one malignant finding. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Gleason is correctly formatted. No issues with the example given, so the answer should follow the same structure.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
