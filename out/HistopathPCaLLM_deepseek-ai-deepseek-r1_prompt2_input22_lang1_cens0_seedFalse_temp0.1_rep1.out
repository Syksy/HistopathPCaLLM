Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Thick needle samples are typically biopsies, so Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that the left side fragments show "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (low-differentiated carcinoma tissue), which is malignant. The right side fragments don't show malignancy. Since there's at least one malignant finding, Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The right side isn't malignant, but the instruction says to report the worst lesion. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst Gleason. The example uses "major+minor=sum" format, so "3+4=7" is correct. All other details like chronic inflammation or nerve involvement don't affect these specific fields. 

Double-checking the sample type: "paksuneulanäytteitä" confirms biopsy. Malignancy is present on the left, so "kyllä". Gleason from the worst lesion (left side) is correctly formatted. Everything seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
