Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä," which translates to "thick needle samples of the prostate." Needle samples are typically biopsies. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The report says that on the left side, there's "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" which is low-grade carcinoma, indicating malignancy. The right side fragments don't show malignancy. But since there's at least one malignant finding, the overall Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the left side has primary pattern 3 and secondary 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The right side is benign, but we only consider the worst lesion. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is taken. The example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7" fits. All other details like chronic inflammation or nerve involvement don't affect these fields. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
