Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "näytteitä" (samples) is a bit generic. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Since it's just referred to as tissue samples without specifying the procedure, I might have to go with NA. But wait, sometimes "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" could imply biopsy, but the report doesn't explicitly state the method. Hmm, maybe NA is safer here because it's not clear if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report says there's chronic inflammation ("Kroonista tulehdusta") and mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide range of cell differentiation types). However, there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "pahanlaatuinen" or "karsinooma." The Gleason grade is mentioned as being difficult to determine, but the samples are too fragmented. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no). Wait, but the presence of cell differentiation issues might be suspicious. However, the report states that the samples are not suitable for classification and need reprocessing. So, without confirmed malignancy, the answer should be "ei" or maybe NA? The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). Since they can't confirm malignancy due to sample issues, maybe "ei" is correct here. But the user's example had "kyllä" only when malignancy was explicitly found. Here, it's unclear, so maybe "ei" if no malignancy is detected, or NA if uncertain. The example given in the problem where malignancy wasn't clear used "NA", but in this case, the report doesn't state any malignancy, just inflammation and differentiation issues. So perhaps "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The report explicitly says that determining the Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide scale of cell differentiation and fragmented samples. They mention that the samples are not suitable for classification and need reprocessing. Therefore, there's no Gleason score reported. Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there was a mention of a possible Gleason, if malignancy isn't confirmed, it's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified (biopsy, RP, TURP). Malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy is found, just inflammation and inconclusive results. Gleason is NA because no score is provided and malignancy isn't confirmed.
