Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "kudosnäytteitä" (tissue samples) could be a biopsy, but I need to check the allowed values: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text doesn't specify the exact procedure like TURP or RP, so maybe it's a biopsy. But wait, "purkillinen" just means a jar, so it's unclear. The sample might be from a biopsy, but since it's not explicitly stated, perhaps the answer is NA. However, sometimes in medical contexts, "kudosnäytteitä" can imply biopsy. Hmm, but the example given in the instructions used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta," which is explicit. Here, it's not clear, so maybe NA is safer.

Second, malignancy. The report says there's chronic inflammation ("Kroonista tulehdusta") and mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types). But there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The text states that Gleason grading is exceptionally difficult, and the samples are fragmented and not suitable for classification. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the answer here would be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are "kyllä," "ei," or NA. If there's no mention of cancer, then "ei." But sometimes chronic inflammation doesn't rule out malignancy. However, the report doesn't state any malignant findings, so "ei" seems correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The text explicitly says that determining Gleason is too difficult due to the sample's condition, and they need to reprocess. So no Gleason is provided. The instructions say to use "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei," Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear (maybe NA), Malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example where malignancy was present, Gleason was filled. Here, since malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. The sample type isn't clearly biopsy, RP, or TURP, so NA. So the JSON should be all NAs except Malignancy as "ei"? Wait, no. Wait, the second question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any malignancy, just chronic inflammation and atypical cells but no cancer, then the answer is "ei." So the JSON would have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as "ei," and Gleason as NA. Let me confirm. The text doesn't mention cancer, so malignancy is "ei." The sample type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, just "kudosnäytteitä" in a jar, so NA. Gleason is NA because no malignancy. That makes sense.
