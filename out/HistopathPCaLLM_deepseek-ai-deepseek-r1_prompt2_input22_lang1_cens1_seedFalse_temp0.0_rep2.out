Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "kudosnäytteitä" refers to tissue samples. The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's just tissue samples without specifying the procedure, maybe it's a biopsy. But wait, the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text says "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, the sample is "prostatan kudosnäytteitä," which could be a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. However, in medical contexts, tissue samples from the prostate are often biopsies. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the sample is from a TURP or RP, but the text doesn't mention surgery. So maybe "biopsy" is the safest bet here. But let me check again. The text doesn't specify the procedure type, just that it's tissue samples. Hmm. The example had "biopsy" when the word "biopsiasta" was present. Here, there's no such term. So maybe the sample type is NA? Wait, the options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's not clear, maybe NA. But the user might expect "biopsy" because it's tissue samples. But I need to be careful. Let me look for keywords. The text says "näytteitä tutkittiin" (samples were examined) and mentions "prosessoida uudelleen" (process again). It doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So perhaps the sample type is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Kroonista tulehdusta havaitaan systemaattisesti koko materiaalin läpi." That's chronic inflammation, which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "pahanlaatuinen" or "karsinooma." The Gleason part is discussed, but they say determining the grade is difficult due to the samples being fragmented and varied. So the report doesn't confirm malignancy. The presence of chronic inflammation doesn't indicate cancer. So malignancy would be "ei" (no). Wait, but the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no mention of cancer, then "ei." But I need to check if there's any hint. The text mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types), which might suggest some atypia, but not necessarily malignancy. Since the report states that the samples are not suitable for classification and need reprocessing, and there's no explicit mention of cancer, malignancy should be "ei."

Gleason score: The text says "Gleason-luokan määrittäminen... olisi poikkeuksellisen vaikeaa" (determining Gleason grade would be exceptionally difficult) and "eivät sovellu luokitteluun" (not suitable for classification). Therefore, they didn't assign a Gleason score. Since malignancy is "ei," Gleason is "NA" as per the instructions.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the procedure isn't specified), malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is "NA."
