Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let's go through each field one by one.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The word "näytteitä" (samples) and the context suggest it's a biopsy. But wait, "purkillinen" means jar, which could be from a TURP procedure. However, TURP usually refers to transurethral resection. The text doesn't mention surgery like RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP explicitly. It just says tissue samples. Hmm, maybe it's a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. The example given used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta." Here, the sample is just "kudosnäytteitä" (tissue samples) without specifying the procedure. Since it's not clear if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe the safest choice is NA. But wait, the example used "biopsy" even when the term was "biopsiasta." Here, the term isn't as specific. Let me check again. The text says "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" which are prostate tissue samples. If it's a biopsy, the sample type would be biopsy. But if it's from a resection, it could be TURP or RP. Since the text doesn't specify the procedure, maybe NA is better. But the example used "biopsy" when the procedure was mentioned. Here, since it's just tissue samples without the procedure, maybe NA.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types) but doesn't explicitly state malignancy. There's no mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or malignancy. They also mention that Gleason grading is difficult and samples need reprocessing. So, since there's no clear indication of malignancy, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) or NA. Wait, but the absence of malignancy isn't stated. The example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, since they can't determine Gleason because the samples are fragmented and varied, but there's no mention of malignancy. So maybe malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe it's "ei" or NA. Since they can't classify due to sample issues, maybe NA is appropriate here.

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum". If malignancy is "ei" or NA, then Gleason is NA. Since in the example, when malignancy was "kyllä", Gleason was provided. Here, if malignancy is NA or "ei", then Gleason is NA. The text says Gleason-luokan määrittäminen on vaikeaa, so they couldn't determine it. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the procedure isn't specified), malignancy is NA (since it's unclear, samples are problematic), Gleason is NA.
