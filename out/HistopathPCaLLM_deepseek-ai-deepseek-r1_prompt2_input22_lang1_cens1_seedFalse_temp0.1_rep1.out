Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let's go through each field one by one.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which translates to "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "näytteitä" (samples) and the context suggest it's a biopsy. But wait, "purkillinen" means jar, which could be a container for any sample. However, there's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's just tissue samples, maybe biopsy is correct. But I need to be careful. The report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. Hmm, maybe NA is safer here? But "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" (prostate tissue samples) usually refers to biopsy. Let's go with biopsy.

Second, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "epätavallisen laajaa skaalaa solujen erilaistumistyyppejä" (unusually wide scale of cell differentiation types), which might suggest some abnormality, but there's no clear mention of malignancy like "adenokarsinooma" or "pahanlaatuinen." Also, they say Gleason grading is exceptionally difficult and the samples need reprocessing. So maybe malignancy can't be confirmed. The report doesn't state malignancy, so perhaps the answer is "ei" or NA. Wait, the third field's Gleason is NA if benign. But the presence of varied cells doesn't necessarily mean malignant. Since the report doesn't confirm cancer, malignancy should be "ei" or NA. But the instructions say if no malignancy, Gleason is NA. Let me check again. The text says they can't determine Gleason because the samples are too fragmented and varied. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because they didn't find any, but the samples are inadequate. Or maybe it's NA because the determination wasn't possible. The example given in the problem had "NA" when the report was nonsensical. Here, the report is about not being able to classify due to sample issues. Since they didn't find any malignancy (only chronic inflammation), maybe "ei" is correct. But the user's example used "NA" when the report was unclear. In this case, the report doesn't state malignancy, so maybe "ei" is appropriate. Wait, the presence of chronic inflammation is benign. So malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason. The report explicitly states that determining Gleason is exceptionally difficult due to the sample's fragmented and varied nature. They mention the samples are unsuitable for classification and need reprocessing. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA" because it's not provided and the samples are inadequate. Since there's no malignancy confirmed, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Wait, but the sampletype: the original text says "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" which is tissue samples, typically biopsies. But if the sample is from a jar and they can't confirm the origin, maybe sampletype is NA? The user's example had "biopsy" when the sample was a biopsy. Here, the sample is prostate tissue, but the report questions if it's truly prostate-derived. The text says "varmistetaan vielä että materiaali tosiaan on prostatalähtöistä" (confirm that the material is indeed of prostate origin). So there's doubt about the sample's origin. Therefore, maybe sampletype is NA because it's uncertain. But the initial part says "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" which implies it's supposed to be prostate. However, the doubt is about contamination. The sampletype is what was originally taken, not whether it's confirmed. So if it's labeled as prostate samples, even if contaminated, the original type would still be biopsy. Unless the contamination affects the type. The problem states "sampletype" is the original type. So if the original procedure was a biopsy, then it's biopsy. But the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure. The term "näytteitä" (samples) is generic. Without explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe sampletype is NA. Wait, the first example used "biopsy" when the text said "biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention the procedure type, just "näytteitä". So perhaps sampletype is NA. But "prostatan kudosnäytteitä" could imply biopsy. Hmm. The user's instructions say to choose from biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. If the procedure isn't specified, then NA. Since the text doesn't say biopsy, RP, or TURP, just "samples", maybe sampletype is NA. So I need to check the original text again. The input starts with "Purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä tutkittiin," which is "A jar of prostate tissue samples was examined." The term "kudosnäytteitä" is tissue samples, which could be from biopsy, but the exact procedure isn't stated. So according to the allowed values, if it's not clear, use NA. Therefore, sampletype is NA.

So final answer: sampletype NA, malignancy "ei", Gleason NA.
