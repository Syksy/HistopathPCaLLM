Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate." I know that prostatectomy typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given prefers the format "major+minor=sum." The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." However, the detailed breakdown mentions the main component is grade 4 (60%), the second is grade 5 (30%), and a tertiary grade 3. But according to guidelines, the Gleason score is the sum of the two most prevalent grades. Here, the primary is 4 and secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is not included in the sum. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The main grades are 4 and 5, so that's correct. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. All other details like tertiary grade or capsule breach don't affect these fields. The JSON should reflect these values without any nesting.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
