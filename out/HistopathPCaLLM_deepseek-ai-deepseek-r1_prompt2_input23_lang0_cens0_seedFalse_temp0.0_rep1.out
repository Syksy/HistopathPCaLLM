Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate". I know that prostatectomy usually refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given prefers the format "major+minor=sum". The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5". The main components mentioned are stage 4 (60%) as the major and stage 5 (30%) as the minor. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The sum here is 4+5=9. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nesting in the JSON and only the most severe lesion is considered. The answer should be straightforward with the three fields filled accordingly.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
