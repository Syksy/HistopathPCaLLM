Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so I know that prostatectomy refers to RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The main components here are the major and minor grades. The report mentions differentiation stage 4 (60%) as the primary, and stage 5 (30%) as the second most common. Tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but since we only consider the two highest grades, it's 4 and 5. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The tertiary grade 3 is smaller, so it's ignored. The answer should be in the format "4+5=9". Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. All values seem to fit, so the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy yes, and Gleason 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
