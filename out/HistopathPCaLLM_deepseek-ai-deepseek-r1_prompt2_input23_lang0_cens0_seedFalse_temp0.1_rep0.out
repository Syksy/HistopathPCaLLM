Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given prostate cancer histopathological statement. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those exactly.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input statement starts with "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate..." Prostatectomy refers to surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the correct sample type here. That's straightforward.

Next, determining if there are malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes." The example given in the instructions also uses "yes" when adenocarcinoma is present, so that's confirmed.

Now, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to format it as "major+minor=sum" with whole numbers. The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." Looking at the details: the main differentiation stage is 4 (60%), the second most common is stage 5 (30%), and tertiary grade 3. However, Gleason scoring typically takes the two most predominant grades. The primary is 4, secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is mentioned but not included in the sum. The example uses the major and minor, so even though the tertiary is present, the main sum is 4+5=9. The conclusion also confirms the sum is 9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to check if there's any ambiguity. The sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is yes because of adenocarcinoma. Gleason is 4+5=9 as per the conclusion. No nested structures, just flat JSON. All values fit the allowed options. No issues here. The answer should be the JSON with those values.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
