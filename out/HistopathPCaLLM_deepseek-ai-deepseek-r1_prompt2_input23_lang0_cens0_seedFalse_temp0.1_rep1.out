Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given prostate cancer histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatectomy preparate," so I know that prostatectomy refers to surgical removal of the prostate. RP is the abbreviation for radical prostatectomy, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report clearly states "adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

For Gleason, the example given prefers the format "major+minor=sum". The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." However, the detailed description mentions the main component is grade 4 (60%), the second most common is grade 5 (30%), and tertiary grade 3. But according to Gleason grading rules, the sum is the primary grade plus the secondary grade. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, it's not included in the sum. The primary is 4, secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The conclusion confirms sum 9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The main components are 4 and 5, leading to sum 9. The tertiary grade 3 is less significant here. The structured JSON should reflect the highest Gleason score reported, which is 4+5=9.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
