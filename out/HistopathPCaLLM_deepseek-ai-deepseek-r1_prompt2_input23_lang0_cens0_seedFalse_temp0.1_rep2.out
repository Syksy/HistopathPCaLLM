Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement, it starts with "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate..." Prostatectomy refers to surgical removal of the prostate, so RP is the sample type here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The report mentions "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example given prefers the format "major+minor=sum." The conclusion states "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." However, the detailed description mentions the main component is grade 4 (60%), the second most common is grade 5 (30%), and tertiary grade 3. According to Gleason grading rules, the primary (most extensive) and secondary (next most extensive) grades are added. Tertiary is only considered if it's higher. Here, primary is 4, secondary is 5, so 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is lower, so it doesn't affect the sum. The correct Gleason should be "4+5=9."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, only the most severe lesion's results should be returned. The example uses "4+3=7" so following that format. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
