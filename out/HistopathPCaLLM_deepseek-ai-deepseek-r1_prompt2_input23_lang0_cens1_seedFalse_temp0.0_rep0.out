Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the conclusion mentions "the sample is to be reprocessed with a focus on the apex." The initial part talks about a prepared sample set and mentions ultrasound and palpation. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The prior incomplete report mentioned "sampled apex," but that doesn't specify the sample type. So, I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, whether there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement refers to "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior report. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant. However, the current conclusion says they need to reprocess the sample to validate initial suspicions. So, the current report doesn't confirm malignancy yet; it's still under investigation. Therefore, Malignancy should be NA because it's not confirmed as yes or no in this current statement.

Lastly, the reported Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the current report is about validating suspicions and the prior mention was Gleason 3, but the current conclusion doesn't confirm a Gleason score, there's no definitive Gleason grade provided here. The prior report's Gleason 3 is not part of the current findings. So, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed grade in the current report.
