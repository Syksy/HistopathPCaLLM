Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "prepared sample set" and "reprocessed with a focus on the apex." There's a reference to an "ultrasound report and palpation" and a prior incomplete report of "sampled apex." The term "sampled apex" might indicate a biopsy, but the original sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The conclusion says the sample is to be reprocessed, but the original sample type isn't clear. So, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior report. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is a malignant tumor. However, the current conclusion states that the sample needs reprocessing to validate initial suspicions. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here but only suspected, the answer isn't a definitive yes. The current report doesn't confirm malignancy, so Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The prior report mentioned Gleason 3, but it's unclear if that's a sum or just a part. Since the current report is about reprocessing to validate, there's no confirmed Gleason grade here. The prior report's Gleason 3 might refer to a grade, but without a sum (like 3+3=6), it's incomplete. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original sample isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's only a suspicion. Gleason is NA because there's no complete Gleason score provided in the current report.
