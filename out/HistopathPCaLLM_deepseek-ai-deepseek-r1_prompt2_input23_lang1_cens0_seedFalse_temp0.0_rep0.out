Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, so the sample type here is RP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which means adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the summary says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." The required format is "major+minor=sum". The primary pattern is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), but since Gleason 9 can be either 4+5 or 5+4. However, the highest grade is taken as the primary. Wait, in the latest grading, the primary is the higher grade if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no—Gleason scoring for sum 9 could be 4+5=9 or 5+4=9. But the text mentions "pääosin erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (60%)" which is the major component, and "toiseksi yleisin luokka 5" as secondary. So major is 4, minor is 5, sum 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

But wait, the example given in the problem uses "4+3=7". So the format is major plus minor equals sum. The user's example uses the primary and secondary patterns. So in this case, the primary is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), so 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is ignored because only the two highest are considered. So the correct Gleason is "4+5=9".

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+5=9

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The tertiary 3 is not included. The summary also directly states the sum is 9, which aligns with 4+5=9. So that's correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
