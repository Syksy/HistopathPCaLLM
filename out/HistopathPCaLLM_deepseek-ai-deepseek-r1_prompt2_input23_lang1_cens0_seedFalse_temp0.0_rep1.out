Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the summary says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5". The user wants the format "major+minor=sum". The main components are grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%), so 4+5=9. Even though there's a tertiary grade 3, we only consider the two highest grades. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the major and minor components, ignoring tertiary. The answer should be straightforward.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
