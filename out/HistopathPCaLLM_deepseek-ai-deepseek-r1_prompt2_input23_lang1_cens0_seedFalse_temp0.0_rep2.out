Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista käynnistetyistä leikkeistä". "Prostatektomiapreparaati" translates to prostatectomy specimen, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) in the allowed values. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report states "todetaan keskivaiheilta basikseen asti ulottuvaa adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which means adenocarcinoma was found. Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the summary says "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." The required format is "major+minor=sum". The main components mentioned are grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%), with a tertiary grade 3. However, according to Gleason scoring rules, the primary and secondary grades are the two most predominant. Here, the primary is 4, secondary is 5, so sum is 4+5=9. The tertiary grade 3 is not included in the sum. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses the major and minor components, so even though the tertiary is present, it's ignored. The answer should be straightforward.
