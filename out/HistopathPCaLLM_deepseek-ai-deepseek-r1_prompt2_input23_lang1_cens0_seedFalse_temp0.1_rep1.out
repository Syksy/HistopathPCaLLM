Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." The term "prostatektomiapreparaastista" translates to prostatectomy specimen. Prostatectomy usually refers to RP, so Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinoomamuutosta", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the summary states "YHTEENVETO: Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." The required format is "major+minor=sum". The main components are grade 4 (60%) and grade 5 (30%), so major is 5 and minor is 4. Adding them gives 5+4=9. Therefore, Gleason should be "5+4=9".

I need to ensure that only the highest grade is considered. Even though grade 3 is mentioned as tertiary, it's minor and not part of the primary or secondary, so it's excluded. The answer should reflect the two highest grades contributing to the sum.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
