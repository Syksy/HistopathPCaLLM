Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "prostatektomiapreparaastista," which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "Prostatektomia" is the Finnish term for prostatectomy, so the sample type here is RP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomamuutosta," which means adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the summary says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." The correct format is major + minor = sum. However, the text mentions the primary pattern is 4 (60%), secondary is 5 (30%), and tertiary 3. But according to Gleason grading, the tertiary pattern isn't added if it's lower. However, in cases where the highest grade is present, even if tertiary, some systems might consider it. But the summary directly states the sum is 9, which would be 4 + 5 = 9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

Wait, the user instruction says to take the worst (pahimman) lesion. The primary is 4 (60%), secondary 5 (30%). So combining the two highest grades, 4 and 5, sum to 9. The tertiary 3 is ignored. The example given in the problem uses major + minor, so even though the tertiary is present, it's not included. The summary also explicitly states the sum is 9, so that's the correct value.

So the JSON should be:
Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+5=9

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's data is included. The example uses "4+3=7" when both grades are present, so following that format here with 4+5=9 is correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
