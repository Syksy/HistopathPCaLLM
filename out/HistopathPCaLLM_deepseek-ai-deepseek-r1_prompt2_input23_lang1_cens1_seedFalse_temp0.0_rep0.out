Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the mention is "näytesetistä" which translates to sample set. There's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about taking samples for further testing, but it's unclear if it's a biopsy or another procedure. So Sampletype might be NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason is used for cancer grading, so that suggests malignancy. However, the current summary says they need to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. Since the original suspicion was Gleason 3, which is cancerous, but the current sample might not confirm it yet. The key here is whether the current sample has malignant findings. The current report's summary is about re-examining to validate, so maybe the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy yet. So Malignancy could be "ei" or "kyllä". Wait, the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but the current sample is being re-examined. The current text doesn't explicitly state malignancy in the current sample. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" or NA? But the previous report is not the current sample. The current sample's malignancy status isn't confirmed yet. So the answer here might be "ei" or "NA". Hmm, tricky. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current sample's analysis is pending, maybe there's no confirmed malignancy yet. So Malignancy would be "ei" or "NA". But the example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when Gleason is present. Wait, in the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma with Gleason score leads to "kyllä". Here, the current sample's summary is about re-examining to validate the suspicion. The original suspicion (from a previous report) was Gleason 3, but the current sample's findings aren't clear. The text doesn't state that malignancy was found in the current sample. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei" or "NA". But the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. If the current sample hasn't found malignancy yet, but the previous report did, but that's not part of the current sample. So maybe Malignancy is "ei" here, or "NA". The example where the text was nonsensical resulted in all NAs. Here, the text is a valid report but maybe inconclusive. The key is whether the current sample has malignancy. The text mentions the previous report's findings but the current sample's summary is about needing to focus on the apex to validate. So perhaps the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, Malignancy would be "ei" or "NA". The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the current sample's analysis is pending, maybe the malignancy is not confirmed, so "ei" or "NA". The example where Gleason was mentioned in the text led to "kyllä". Here, the previous report's Gleason is mentioned, but the current sample's result isn't clear. So maybe Malignancy is "NA" because it's not confirmed in the current sample. Alternatively, if the suspicion implies possible malignancy, but the instructions say to report only confirmed findings. So if the current sample hasn't found malignancy yet, then "ei". But the text doesn't explicitly say that malignancy was found. So perhaps Malignancy is "ei" or "NA". The example given in the problem had a clear mention of adenocarcinoma, leading to "kyllä". Here, there's no such mention. So Malignancy is "ei" or "NA". The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. If the current sample's analysis is incomplete and they need to re-examine, maybe the current sample's findings are not conclusive. Therefore, Malignancy would be "NA". 

Third, Gleason score. The previous report mentioned Gleason grade 3, but the current sample's summary doesn't report any Gleason. The instructions say to report the Gleason for malignant cases. If Malignancy is "ei" or "NA", then Gleason is "NA". Since the current sample's analysis is pending and the Gleason mentioned is from a previous report, not the current sample, the Gleason here would be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (no clear mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP), Malignancy is NA (current sample's findings not confirmed), Gleason is NA.
