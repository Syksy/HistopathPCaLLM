Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the sample is mentioned as "näytesetistä" which translates to sample set. The report talks about taking additional samples from the apex, but there's no clear mention of the original sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So I think Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text refers to a previous report mentioning Gleason grade 3 findings. However, the current summary doesn't explicitly state malignancy. Gleason 3 is part of the grading system, but grade 3 can be in both benign and malignant contexts. Wait, no—Gleason scores are for adenocarcinoma. So if there's a Gleason mentioned, does that imply malignancy? The example given in the instructions shows that if Gleason is present, malignancy is "kyllä". But in this case, the current report's summary is about re-examining to validate the original suspicion. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but the current one doesn't confirm malignancy yet. So maybe Malignancy is NA here because it's not confirmed in the current sample. Or does the mention of Gleason 3 in the previous report count? The current sample's findings aren't clear. The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion in the sample. Since the current report is about re-examining and the original suspicion (from a previous report) is mentioned, but the current sample's results aren't conclusive, perhaps Malignancy is NA. Wait, but the example given in the problem had a clear mention of adenocarcinoma with Gleason, so malignancy was yes. Here, the current report's summary is about needing to focus on the apex to validate the suspicion. So maybe the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, Malignancy would be NA.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum". The previous report mentioned Gleason grade 3, but the current report's summary doesn't provide a Gleason score. The example shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. But here, the malignancy status is unclear. However, since the current report doesn't state a Gleason score (only the previous one did), and the task is to report the findings from the current sample, the Gleason here should be NA. The instructions specify to report the worst lesion's results, but if the current sample's analysis isn't conclusive and is pending re-examination, then there's no Gleason reported here. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original sample type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the current report doesn't confirm it, only mentions a previous suspicion. Gleason is NA because the current sample's analysis isn't providing a Gleason score yet.
