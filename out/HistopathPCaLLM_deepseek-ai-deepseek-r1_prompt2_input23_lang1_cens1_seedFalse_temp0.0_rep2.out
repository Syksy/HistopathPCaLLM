Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the summary mentions that the sample needs to be reprocessed focusing on the apex to validate the original suspicion. The original sample isn't explicitly stated here. The text refers to "näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen" which means the sample is being reprocessed, but there's no mention of whether it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. I should check the original Finnish text again. The first part says "Osia valmistellusta näytesetistä otetaan lisätutkimuksiin" which translates to parts of the prepared sample set are taken for further testing. But the type isn't mentioned. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions an earlier report on apex samples noted Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason is related to cancer grading, so if there's a Gleason mentioned, that implies malignancy. But wait, the current sample's malignancy isn't directly stated. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, but the current sample's processing is to validate the suspicion. However, the presence of Gleason in the previous report might indicate that malignancy is present. But the current sample's result isn't given yet. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current sample is being reprocessed and the original suspicion (which had Gleason 3) is being validated, but the current report doesn't confirm malignancy yet. Hmm, this is tricky. The summary says they need to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion was Gleason 3, which is cancer. But the current sample's findings aren't reported here. The user might want malignancy as "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason, but maybe not. Wait, the instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. The previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample's processing is to validate that. Since the current report's findings aren't given, maybe malignancy is NA. But the presence of Gleason in the previous report might be considered. However, the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. The user might expect "kyllä" because there's a suspicion, but according to the example, if the report doesn't confirm malignancy, it's NA. Wait, in the example given, if the text isn't a proper report, all are NA. Here, the current report is about reprocessing, but the previous report had Gleason 3. But the current sample's result isn't given. So maybe malignancy is NA because the current sample's result isn't available yet. Or does the mention of Gleason in the previous report count? The user instructions say to process the given lausunto (statement). The current statement's summary is about reprocessing to validate the original suspicion. The original suspicion (from a previous report) had Gleason 3, which is malignant. But the current sample's result isn't provided. So maybe malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a mention of a previous malignant finding. But the current sample's processing hasn't confirmed it yet. This is a bit ambiguous. The example given in the problem shows that if the text isn't a proper report, all are NA. But here, the text is a report but doesn't have the current sample's findings. The user might expect malignancy as "kyllä" because there's a previous Gleason mentioned. But I need to check the instructions again. The user says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). Since the current sample is being reprocessed and the original suspicion (with Gleason 3) is mentioned, but the current sample's result isn't given, perhaps malignancy is "kyllä" based on the previous report. But the current report's findings are not available. Hmm. The example given in the problem had a clear statement of malignancy. Here, the current report is about reprocessing, so maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed yet. Therefore, malignancy would be NA. But the previous report's findings are part of the current report's context. The user might want us to consider any mentioned Gleason as indicating malignancy. For example, in the example, the presence of Gleason led to "kyllä". Here, the previous report's Gleason 3 is mentioned, which is a malignant finding. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum". The previous report mentioned Gleason luokan 3. Wait, in Finnish, "Gleason luokka" can refer to the grade, which is a sum. But the text says "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" which translates to "findings of Gleason grade 3". However, Gleason grade is a sum of two numbers. If it's grade 3, that would be 3=1+2 or 2+1, but typically, Gleason scores are 6 or higher in current grading. Wait, maybe there's a translation issue. In older systems, Gleason scores could be lower, but nowadays, the lowest is 6 (3+3). But the text says "Gleason luokan 3", which might be a translation error or a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the primary pattern as 3, but the sum isn't given. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7". So if the current report mentions a previous Gleason grade 3, but the sum isn't provided, how to handle it? The user instructions say to report "major+minor=sum" as a string. If the sum is 3, but that's not a valid Gleason score (since it's 3+0=3?), but in reality, Gleason scores start at 6. This might be a mistake in the original text. However, according to the user's instructions, we should take the reported value as is. The text says "Gleason luokan 3", which could mean the sum is 3, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be 3+3=6. But we have to go with what's written. The example given in the problem had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3, so sum 4+3=7". So in the current case, the previous report mentions "Gleason luokan 3", which might be the sum. But if the sum is 3, that's not valid. However, the user's system might accept it as per the text. Alternatively, maybe the "luokka" here refers to the primary pattern. For example, primary pattern 3 and secondary pattern 3, making 3+3=6. But the text says "luokan 3", which is ambiguous. Since the user's example uses the sum, perhaps in this case, the sum is 3, but that's invalid. Therefore, maybe the Gleason is NA. Alternatively, the text might have a typo, and the actual sum is 6 (3+3), but we can't assume that. Since the user's instructions say to take the reported value, and the text says "Gleason luokan 3", which is unclear, perhaps the Gleason is NA. But the example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason should be present. However, in this case, the current sample's Gleason isn't given, only the previous one. The user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. The previous report's Gleason is 3, but the current sample is being reprocessed. So maybe the current sample's Gleason isn't available yet, so Gleason is NA. But the previous report's Gleason is mentioned. However, the user might want us to include any mentioned Gleason, even from previous reports. But the example shows that the Gleason is taken from the current report. In the example given, the statement directly mentions the Gleason. Here, the current report is about reprocessing, and the previous report's Gleason is mentioned. So perhaps the Gleason here is NA because the current sample's result isn't available. But the user's instructions might require us to take the worst one mentioned, even if it's from a previous report. This is unclear. The example's malignancy was "kyllä" because the current report found adenocarcinoma. Here, the current report is about reprocessing, and the previous report had Gleason 3. If we consider the previous report's findings as part of the current context, then malignancy is "kyllä" and Gleason is 3. But the format requires "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 3, then it's "3+0=3", but that's not a valid Gleason score. Alternatively, maybe the original text meant Gleason grade group 3, which is a different system. But the user's example uses the traditional Gleason score. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest answer is to put Gleason as NA because the current sample's result isn't available, and the previous report's mention is unclear. Alternatively, if we take "Gleason luokan 3" as the sum, even if it's invalid, we should report it as "3=3" but the format requires "major+minor=sum". If the text only mentions the sum as 3, but doesn't specify the components, we can't split it into major and minor. Therefore, in this case, Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't mentioned)
Malignancy: kyllä (because previous report mentioned Gleason, implying malignancy)
Gleason: NA (since the current report doesn't provide a sum, and the previous report's mention is unclear)

Wait, but the example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which became "4+3=7". Here, the previous report says "Gleason luokan 3", which could be the sum. If the sum is 3, but that's not possible, maybe it's a typo and should be 3+3=6. But we can't assume that. Since the user's instructions say to take the reported value, and the text says "Gleason luokan 3", which is ambiguous, perhaps we should put "3=3" but that's not in the correct format. The correct format is "major+minor=sum". If only the sum is given, we can't split into major and minor. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Alternatively, maybe the "Gleason luokka 3" refers to the primary pattern being 3, but without the secondary, so we can't determine the sum. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

So final JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but malignancy is "kyllä" because the previous report mentioned Gleason. However, the current sample's processing is to validate the suspicion. If the current sample hasn't confirmed it yet, maybe malignancy should be NA. But the example shows that if the text is a proper report with findings, malignancy is "kyllä". Here, the text is a report that refers to a previous finding but doesn't confirm it in the current sample. So maybe malignancy is NA. This is a bit confusing. Let me check the example again. In the example, the text clearly states "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), so malignancy is "kyllä". In the current case, the text mentions a previous report with Gleason 3, but the current sample's result isn't given. The user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's results. If the previous report's result is considered part of the current data, then malignancy is "kyllä". But if the current sample is being reprocessed and the results aren't in yet, then malignancy might be NA. The user's instructions might expect that any mention of malignancy (even in previous reports within the current text) should be considered. Therefore, malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason is "3" but since the format requires major+minor=sum and we don't have both components, it's NA. Alternatively, if the "Gleason luokan 3" is the sum, then it's "3=3", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Since we don't have major and minor, it's invalid, so Gleason is NA.

So the final answer would be:

Sampletype: NA
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: NA
