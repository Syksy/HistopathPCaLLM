Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen siten, että keskitytään apeksiin" which refers to a sample needing re-examination focusing on the apex. The original report mentions "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä" which suggests previous apex samples. However, the current text doesn't explicitly state the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype might be NA here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text refers to "suspisio" (suspicion) and mentions "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" from a previous report. Gleason 3 is part of the grading, but since it's from a prior report and the current sample is being re-examined, it's unclear if malignancy is confirmed here. The current summary doesn't explicitly state malignancy, so maybe Malignancy is NA. But wait, Gleason 3 is typically part of a cancer diagnosis. However, the current sample's findings aren't confirmed yet. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current report is about re-examining to validate suspicion, maybe malignancy isn't confirmed yet. So Malignancy could be "ei" or "kyllä"? Hmm. Wait, the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is a low-grade cancer. So if the current sample is to validate that, but the current text's summary doesn't confirm it, maybe the malignancy is still suspected but not confirmed here. The instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. If the current sample's findings are inconclusive and they need to re-examine, maybe malignancy is NA. But the example given in the problem shows that if Gleason is present, malignancy is "kyllä". However, in this case, the Gleason 3 is from a previous report, not the current sample. The current sample's result isn't provided yet. So perhaps Malignancy is NA here because the current report doesn't confirm it, only refers to a previous suspicion.

Third, Gleason score. The text mentions "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä oli maininnut Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä." So the previous report had Gleason 3. But the current sample's Gleason isn't stated. The user instructions say to report the Gleason only for malignant cases, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy here is unclear (maybe NA), then Gleason would be NA. But wait, the previous report had Gleason 3, but the current sample is being re-examined. The user wants the worst lesion's results. However, the current sample's data isn't provided, only the previous one. The instructions say to take into account only the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample's analysis isn't concluded yet (they need to re-examine), there's no Gleason reported here. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't specified in the current report, so NA. Malignancy is based on current findings; since the current report is about re-examining to validate suspicion but doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe NA. Gleason isn't available in the current sample's results, so NA. Therefore, all fields would be NA. But wait, the previous report had Gleason 3. However, the user instructions specify to report the worst lesion's results from the current sample. Since the current sample is being re-processed and the results aren't in yet, we can't take the previous report's Gleason. So the answer should be all NAs.
