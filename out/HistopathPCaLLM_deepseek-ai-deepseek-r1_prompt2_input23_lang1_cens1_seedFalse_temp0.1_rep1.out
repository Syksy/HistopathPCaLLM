Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is mentioned as "näyte" which is Finnish for sample. The text refers to "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä" which translates to a previous report on apex samples. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the original sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä" which means Gleason grade 3 findings. Gleason grade 3 is part of the grading system for prostate cancer, which is malignant. However, the context here is a previous report that mentioned grade 3, and the current summary is about re-examining to validate the initial suspicion. The current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed yet; they need to focus on the apex to validate. So the malignancy status here isn't definitively confirmed. Hence, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason score, the previous report mentioned grade 3, but the current sample's analysis isn't complete. The summary indicates they need to re-process the sample to validate the suspicion. Since the current sample's Gleason isn't reported yet, and the previous one is just a mention, we shouldn't take the previous report's Gleason as the current result. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the current sample's result isn't confirmed. Gleason is NA because the current sample hasn't reported a score yet.
