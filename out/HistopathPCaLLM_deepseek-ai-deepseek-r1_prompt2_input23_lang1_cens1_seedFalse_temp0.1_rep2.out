Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the relevant part is "Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen siten, että keskitytään apeksiin..." The original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned here. The example given in the instructions had "biopsy" because the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In this case, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe the sample type is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions "aluperäinen suspisio" which refers to a suspicion, but it's not confirmed here. The previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is considered less aggressive, but the current summary doesn't state any malignancy findings. However, since the original suspicion was there and they want to re-examine, but the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the sample. The example had malignancy as "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, the current sample's summary doesn't report any malignancy, just that they need to re-examine to validate the original suspicion. So maybe malignancy is "ei" or NA. But the previous report mentioned Gleason 3, which is part of a cancer grade, but the current sample's findings aren't clear. Hmm. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current text refers to a previous mention of Gleason 3 but the current sample's analysis isn't conclusive, maybe malignancy is NA here. Or does the mention of Gleason 3 in the previous report count? Wait, the current sample's summary is the one being processed. The text says "YHTEENVETO: Näyte tulee käsitellä uudelleen..." which suggests that the current sample's analysis isn't complete, and they need to focus on the apex to validate the original suspicion. So the current sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy yet. Therefore, malignancy would be "ei" or NA. But according to the example, if there's no clear malignancy, it's NA. So maybe malignancy is NA here.

Third, Gleason score. The example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is reported. If malignancy is "ei" or NA, then Gleason is NA. In this case, since the current sample's malignancy isn't confirmed (they need to re-examine), but the previous report mentioned Gleason 3. However, the instructions say to report the worst lesion's results from the current sample. The current text mentions "aiempi keskeneräinen raportti apeksinäytteistä oli maininnut Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä." But that's from a previous report, not the current sample. The current sample's analysis isn't conclusive yet. Therefore, the Gleason here should be NA because the current sample's findings don't confirm malignancy, and the previous report's Gleason isn't part of the current sample's data. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified. Malignancy is NA because the current sample's analysis isn't conclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no current malignancy confirmed.
