Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text states "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the summary mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The Gleason score is typically presented as the sum of the primary and secondary grades. However, the exact primary and secondary grades (like 4+4=8) aren't explicitly stated here. The text does mention Gleason 4, but since the sum is 8, it's possible that both the major and minor components are 4. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8" based on the sum provided, even though the exact breakdown isn't detailed. But wait, the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3". In the current case, the text says "sum 8" but doesn't specify the individual grades. However, since the sum is 8 and the highest possible Gleason grade is 5, the only combination that sums to 8 with the highest grade (since it's the most severe) would be 4+4=8. Alternatively, maybe 5+3=8, but the text mentions Gleason 4. Wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might refer to the primary grade. If the primary is 4 and the sum is 8, then the secondary would be 4 (4+4=8). So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

But the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the text says "grades 4 and 3". So the structure is major + minor = sum. Here, the sum is 8, and the primary grade mentioned is 4, but the secondary isn't explicitly stated. However, since the sum is 8, and the primary is 4, the secondary must be 4. Therefore, the correct Gleason format would be "4+4=8".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+4=8

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" which is the highest mentioned, so that's the one to use.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
