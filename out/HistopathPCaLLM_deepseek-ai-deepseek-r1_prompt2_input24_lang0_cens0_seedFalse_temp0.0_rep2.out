Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the input statement, the sample is described as "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the malignancy field should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The input states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the exact major and minor grades aren't explicitly given. But since the sum is 8, and it's common to have combinations like 4+4=8 or 5+3=8. The text mentions Gleason 4, so maybe it's 4+4=8. But the problem is that the exact major and minor aren't specified here. However, the instruction says to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" if possible. Since the sum is 8 and the tumor is classified as Gleason 4, perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4, making 4+4=8. Alternatively, maybe the report just states the sum. But the example given in the problem uses the full format even when the sum is mentioned. So I should try to construct it as "4+4=8" if possible. Wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" but doesn't mention another grade. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Since Gleason score requires two grades, but the user might have only provided the sum. But according to the instructions, the Gleason field should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified, should we put "NA"? But in the example, even if the sum is given, they used the major and minor. Wait, the example given was "4+3=7" when the text said "resulting in a sum of 4+3=7". So if the text says "sum 8", but doesn't specify the individual grades, maybe we can't infer them. However, in the given input, the user wrote "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The exact wording here is "sum 8", which is the total. But the problem is that the Gleason grade requires both the major and minor components. If the text doesn't specify them, should we just put "NA"? But in the example, the sum was derived from the two grades. However, in this case, the input mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might indicate that the major pattern is 4, but the minor isn't stated. But the sum is 8. If the major is 4, then the minor would have to be 4 (4+4=8) or maybe 5 (if 3+5=8, but that's not possible since the higher grade is the major). Wait, Gleason scoring takes the two most prevalent patterns, with the first being the primary (major) and the second the secondary (minor). The sum is their addition. If the sum is 8, possible combinations are 5+3, 4+4, 3+5, etc. But the highest grade is the primary. However, in the input, the tumor is classified as Gleason 4, which might be the primary. If the sum is 8, then 4 + 4 = 8. So maybe the Gleason is "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state both grades, only the sum. The instruction says to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" preferably. If the individual grades aren't mentioned, but the sum is, should we still try to infer? The example given in the problem had both grades mentioned. In the user's input, the sum is given, but the individual grades are not. However, the mention of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" might indicate that the major is 4. If the sum is 8, then minor would be 4. So the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But is that a valid assumption? Alternatively, maybe the report only states the sum, and the individual grades are not provided, so we should put "NA". But the example shows that even if the sum is derived from the grades, it's included. However, in this case, the sum is given directly. The user's instruction says: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements)." So if the report states the sum but not the individual grades, but the sum is given, should we still put "NA"? Or is the sum sufficient? The example includes the sum as part of the "major+minor=sum" format. So perhaps the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the individual grades are not explicitly stated, we can infer them. But in this case, the input says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The problem is that without the individual grades, we can't be certain. However, the mention of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" might imply that the major is 4, and if the sum is 8, then minor is 4. So "4+4=8". Alternatively, maybe the minor is 4. But I'm not sure. The user's example had both grades mentioned. Here, the sum is given, but the individual grades are not. So perhaps the correct approach is to put "NA" for Gleason. But wait, the example in the problem had the sum derived from the grades. Here, the sum is explicitly stated. The instruction says "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum. So if the sum is given but not the individual grades, maybe we can still report the sum as "sum=8", but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". So if the individual grades are not present, but the sum is, should we use "NA"? The example shows that when the sum is derived from the grades, it's included. But if the sum is given without the grades, perhaps it's not possible. However, in the given input, the summary says "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The word "sum" here is part of the statement. So maybe the correct Gleason value is "4+4=8" if the major and minor are both 4. But how do we know? The text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might refer to the primary pattern. If the sum is 8, then the secondary would be 4. So 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. However, the presence of the sum 8 and the mention of Gleason 4 as the class might imply that. Alternatively, maybe the report is just stating the sum without the breakdown, so we can't determine the individual grades. In that case, the Gleason would be "NA". But the example shows that when the sum is given via the grades, it's structured. Here, the sum is given directly. The user's instruction says "preferably" in the major+minor=sum format. So if the individual grades are not present, but the sum is, perhaps we should still put "NA". But the example in the problem includes the sum even when it's derived from the grades. So maybe the correct approach here is to report the sum as "4+4=8" if possible. But how to confirm? The text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", which might mean the primary pattern is 4. If the sum is 8, then secondary is 4. So "4+4=8". Therefore, the Gleason field would be "4+4=8". 

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (from "turp-chippings").

Malignancy is yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant).

Gleason is "4+4=8" based on sum 8 and primary pattern 4.
