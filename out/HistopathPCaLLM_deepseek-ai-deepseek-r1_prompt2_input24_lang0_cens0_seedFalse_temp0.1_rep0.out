Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The sample consists of confirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings..." The term "turp-chippings" stands out. TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." However, the exact major and minor grades aren't explicitly stated. But in some cases, when the sum is given without the individual grades, it's still acceptable to report the sum. But the example provided in the instructions uses "4+3=7", so maybe the user expects a similar format. Wait, the problem says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'... or 'NA' for benign." Since the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't mentioned, should I put "NA"? But the example shows that even if the sum is derived from the grades, it's included. However, in the given statement, it's "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Without the individual grades, maybe we can't format it as "major+minor=sum". But the user might still expect "8" in some form. Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. If the sum is given but not the individual grades, is it acceptable to just put the sum? The example uses "4+3=7", which includes the sum. But if the text only states the sum, like "sum 8", maybe we should put "8". However, the instructions specify the format as "major+minor=sum". Since the individual grades aren't provided here (like 5+3=8 or 4+4=8), perhaps the correct answer is "NA"? Wait, no. The example shows that when the sum is derived from the grades, it's included. But in this case, the statement says "resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." So the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified. The problem says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'... for malignant statements". If the individual grades aren't given, but the sum is, maybe we can just put the sum as "8". But the example uses the full format. However, the user might expect that if the sum is explicitly stated, even without the individual grades, we should use that. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "NA" because the individual grades aren't provided. But the example includes the sum even when derived. Let me check the example again. The example input mentions "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7", so the output is "4+3=7". In the current case, the input says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", but doesn't specify the individual grades. So perhaps the correct Gleason value here is "8", but according to the allowed values, it should be in the format "major+minor=sum". Since the individual grades aren't given, maybe we can't structure it as "4+4=8" or "5+3=8", so the answer should be "NA"? But the problem says "preferably" that format, so maybe "NA" isn't required. Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers or "NA". If the sum is given but not the individual grades, perhaps we can just put the sum as "8". But the example shows that the sum is presented with the individual grades. The instructions might require that the format includes both grades and the sum. Since the current statement only provides the sum (8) without the individual grades, maybe the Gleason field should be "NA". But that seems counterintuitive because the sum is known. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "8" but that doesn't fit the preferred format. Hmm. The user's example uses "4+3=7" when both grades are given. If the individual grades aren't specified, but the sum is, maybe the correct approach is to put "NA" because the required format isn't met. However, the problem statement says "preferably" which suggests that if the sum is given without the individual grades, it's still acceptable to report the sum. But how? The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. Wait, maybe "sum 8" can be written as "8" but the example uses the full format. The problem says "preferably" which implies that if possible, use the major+minor=sum, but if only the sum is available, maybe just the sum. However, the allowed values don't include just the sum. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". So if the individual grades aren't present, even if the sum is given, it should be "NA". But that seems odd. Let me check the example again. The example input has both grades and the sum, so the output includes the sum. The second example, which is invalid, returns "NA" for all. So in this case, since the sum is given but not the individual grades, perhaps the Gleason should be "NA". But the user's instructions might expect that if the sum is explicitly stated, even without the individual grades, it's acceptable. However, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, if the individual grades aren't present, even if the sum is, the answer should be "NA". Wait, but the problem says "preferably" which might mean that if the sum is given without the grades, it's still acceptable to put the sum. But the example shows that the format requires the major and minor. So perhaps in this case, since the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, the Gleason should be "NA". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8" but that's not in the correct format. The user's example uses "4+3=7", so the correct format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, if the individual grades aren't present, even if the sum is, it's "NA". Therefore, in this case, the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the statement says "resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." So the sum is explicitly 8, but the individual grades aren't mentioned. Therefore, according to the allowed values, since the individual grades aren't present, even though the sum is known, the Gleason should be "NA". But that seems counterintuitive. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even without the individual grades, it's acceptable to write "sum=8" or "8". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". So unless the individual grades are present, it's "NA". Therefore, in this case, Gleason is "NA". But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The problem states: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So for malignant statements, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. If the sum is reported but not the individual grades, is that acceptable? The example includes both grades and sum. If the sum is given without the grades, perhaps the answer should be "NA" because the individual grades aren't present. However, in some real-world cases, the sum is reported without the individual grades. But according to the user's instructions, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. Therefore, if the individual grades aren't present, even if the sum is, it's "NA". Therefore, in this case, since the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, the Gleason should be "NA". Wait, but the statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." So the sum is explicitly stated. Maybe the user expects that even if the individual grades aren't given, the sum is still reported. For example, if the text says "Gleason score 7", the answer would be "NA" because the format isn't followed. But in this case, the text says "sum 8", which is the same as the Gleason score. Therefore, perhaps the answer should be "NA" because the format requires major+minor=sum, and the individual grades aren't provided. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8" but that's not in the correct format. The example uses "4+3=7", which includes the sum. Therefore, the correct answer here is "NA" because the individual grades aren't present. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the user would accept "8" in this case. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is "4+4=8" because Gleason sum 8 is typically 4+4 or 5+3. But that's assuming, which we shouldn't do. The text doesn't specify the individual grades, so we can't infer them. Therefore, the safest answer is "NA" for Gleason. But the problem says "preferably" which might mean that if the sum is given, even without the individual grades, it's acceptable. However, the example shows that the sum is derived from the individual grades. Therefore, if the individual grades aren't present, even if the sum is, it's "NA". So in this case, Gleason is "NA". Wait, but the user's example includes a case where the sum is derived from the grades, but here the sum is given directly. Maybe the answer should be "8" but formatted as "sum=8". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, unless the individual grades are present, it's "NA". Therefore, the answer for Gleason is "NA". But I'm conflicted because the sum is explicitly stated. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So "preferably" implies that if the sum is reported without the individual grades, it's still acceptable to use the sum. But the example shows that when the individual grades are present, they are used. However, if the sum is given without the grades, maybe the answer is just the sum. But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". So if the sum is given as "sum 8", perhaps the answer should be "8" but that's not in the required format. Therefore, the correct answer is "NA". 

Wait, but the user's example uses "4+3=7" because the individual grades are 4 and 3. If the text only says "sum 8", then the individual grades aren't provided, so the answer is "NA". Therefore, in this case, Gleason is "NA". 

But the user's problem statement says "preferably 'major+minor=sum'". So if the sum is given but not the individual grades, maybe it's acceptable to just put the sum. But the example doesn't cover that scenario. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8" but that's not in the required format. Therefore, the answer should be "NA". 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is explicitly stated, even without the individual grades, it's acceptable to write "sum=8" or "8". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, the answer must be in that format. Since the individual grades aren't provided, the answer is "NA". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (from "turp-chippings")

Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant)

Gleason: NA (sum is 8 but individual grades not specified)
