Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP". That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "malignant suspicion" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer here is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is "major+minor=sum". The statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Typically, Gleason scores are combinations like 4+4=8 or 5+3=8. However, the exact grades aren't specified here. The example provided in the instructions used "4+3=7" when the text mentioned "Gleason grades 4 and 3". In this case, the text only states "sum 8", so the major and minor grades aren't given. But the user's example included the sum even if the individual grades were mentioned. Wait, the instruction says "preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". If the individual grades aren't specified, can we still put "sum 8"? The example had "4+3=7" because both grades were mentioned. Here, since only the sum is given, maybe "NA" isn't right. But the user might expect us to infer or look for any mention of grades. Let me check the original text again. It says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". So maybe the major grade is 4, but the sum is 8. If 4 is the major, then the minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor grade. However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". In some cases, when only the sum is given without the individual grades, it's possible that the exact grades aren't specified. But the example shows that if the grades are mentioned, they should be used. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So maybe the major is 4 and minor is 4? But the problem is that the minor isn't stated. Alternatively, maybe the report only gives the sum. The instructions say "preferably" the major+minor=sum, but if that's not available, maybe just the sum? But the allowed values specify "preferably" that format. Since the exact grades (4 and 4) aren't mentioned, but the sum is 8, perhaps the correct entry is "4+4=8" assuming that the major and minor are both 4. Alternatively, if the text only says "sum 8", maybe we should put "NA"? Wait, the example given in the problem had the Gleason as "4+3=7" because the text mentioned both grades. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So perhaps the minor grade is 4, making it 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor grade. However, the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. So maybe the correct approach is to put "4+4=8" because the major is 4 (as mentioned) and the sum is 8, so minor must be 4. Alternatively, if the minor isn't mentioned, maybe it's not possible to determine. But the user's instructions say "preferably" the major+minor=sum. So if the sum is given but not the individual grades, perhaps we should still put the sum. Wait, the example in the problem statement includes the sum even when the individual grades are present. So in this case, even if the individual grades aren't both mentioned, but the sum is, maybe we can structure it as "sum 8". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Hmm. The problem is that the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3". Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8". So maybe the major is 4, minor is 4, leading to 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor grade. However, in the summary, it's "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So perhaps the correct Gleason field is "4+4=8" because the major is 4 and the sum is 8. Alternatively, if the minor isn't mentioned, maybe it's not possible to structure it properly. But the user's instructions say to return "NA" only for benign statements. Since this is a malignant case, we need to provide the Gleason. If the exact grades aren't given but the sum is, maybe we can still put the sum as "4+4=8" assuming that's the case. Alternatively, if the text doesn't specify both grades, perhaps we should put "NA". But the example shows that when both grades are mentioned, they are used. Here, only one grade (4) is mentioned, but the sum is 8. So maybe the correct answer is "4+4=8". Alternatively, maybe the report is stating that the sum is 8 without breaking it down, so we can't determine the individual grades. In that case, should we put "NA"? But the user's example didn't have that scenario. The instructions say "preferably" the major+minor=sum. If the individual grades aren't specified, but the sum is, perhaps we can still put the sum as "sum=8", but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". So maybe the answer is "NA" because the individual grades aren't both specified. Wait, but the example in the problem statement had "4+3=7" because the text mentioned both grades. Here, the text mentions Gleason 4, but the sum is 8. So perhaps the minor grade is 4, making it 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. However, in the summary, it's "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So maybe the correct approach is to infer that the sum is 8, even if the individual grades aren't both mentioned. But according to the instructions, the Gleason should be in the format "major+minor=sum". If the individual grades aren't provided, but the sum is, perhaps the answer is "NA". But the user's example didn't cover this scenario. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be "8" but the allowed format requires the major and minor. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the user's instructions again. The allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign. So if the sum is given but not the individual grades, but it's a malignant case, should we put "NA"? Or is the sum alone acceptable? The example given in the problem includes both grades and the sum, so the format is "4+3=7". If the sum is given without the grades, perhaps the answer should be "NA". But in the given text, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So maybe the correct answer is "4+4=8" assuming that the major and minor are both 4, even though the text only mentions Gleason 4. Alternatively, maybe the major is 5 and minor is 3 (5+3=8), but the text doesn't state that. Since the text mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth", perhaps the major is 4, and the minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". Even though the minor isn't explicitly stated, the sum is 8 and the major is 4. So maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, if the minor isn't mentioned, perhaps it's not possible to determine. But given that the summary states the sum as 8, and the major is 4, perhaps the minor is 4. So the answer would be "4+4=8".
