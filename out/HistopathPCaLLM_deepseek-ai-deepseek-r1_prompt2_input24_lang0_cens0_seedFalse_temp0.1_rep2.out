Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first part mentions "turp-chippings". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be TURP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is definitely yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. The statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". However, the exact grades (like 4+4=8 or 5+3=8) aren't specified. But earlier, it mentions Gleason 4. Wait, the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3". In the current case, the summary says "sum 8", but the detailed part mentions Gleason 4. However, the summary is the most severe lesion, right? The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The summary states "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which is the highest mentioned. But the problem is that the exact major and minor grades aren't given. The example uses the specific grades even if the sum is mentioned. Here, the sum is 8, but the components aren't explicitly stated. However, the text does mention Gleason 4, but maybe that's part of the components. Wait, the example uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason grades 4 and 3". So in this case, the user might expect that if the sum is given but the components are not, perhaps we can infer based on the highest mentioned grade. But the problem is that the exact major and minor aren't stated here. The summary says "sum 8", but the detailed part says Gleason 4. However, Gleason 4 plus another grade would sum to 8. For example, 4+4=8 or 5+3=8. But the text doesn't specify. The example provided by the user includes both the components and the sum. Here, the user's instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" preferably. If the components aren't given, but the sum is, should we just put the sum? Wait, the allowed value for Gleason is preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. If the sum is given but the components aren't, maybe we can't structure it as "4+4=8" unless it's explicitly stated. The example given in the instructions includes both the components and the sum. So in the current case, the summary says "sum 8", but the components aren't provided. However, earlier in the text, it mentions Gleason 4. But maybe that's part of the grading. Wait, the text says "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". So the primary pattern is 4, but what's the secondary? If the sum is 8, then 4 + 4 = 8. Alternatively, maybe 5 + 3, but that's less likely. Since the primary is 4, and the sum is 8, the secondary would have to be 4. So the Gleason would be 4+4=8. But the problem is that the text doesn't explicitly state both grades, only the sum. The user's example requires that the components are mentioned. In the example, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so they can write 4+3=7. Here, the statement only mentions Gleason 4 in the detailed part and sum 8 in the summary. So maybe the correct approach is to use the sum as provided, even if the components aren't explicitly stated. Wait, the user's instructions say: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably 'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So if the sum is reported but not the components, can we still put the sum? For example, if the report says "Gleason score 8", but doesn't break it down, then the answer would be "NA"? Or is the sum acceptable? The example given by the user includes both the components and the sum. The instructions say "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum, but if the sum is given without components, maybe we can just put the sum. However, the allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Wait, the allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. So if the sum is given but not the components, perhaps we can't structure it as per the preferred format. But in the example, the sum is derived from the components. In the current case, the summary says "sum 8", but the components aren't specified. However, earlier in the text, it mentions Gleason 4. Maybe the components are 4 and 4, leading to sum 8. But that's an assumption. The problem is that the user's instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum" if possible. If the components aren't given, but the sum is, should we put "NA"? Or is the sum acceptable? The example provided by the user includes both components and sum. So perhaps in this case, since the components (4 and 4) aren't explicitly stated together, but the sum is 8, we should report "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade. Alternatively, if the components aren't both mentioned, maybe we can't. Wait, the text says "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8". So maybe the primary is 4 and the secondary is 4, leading to 8. But the exact breakdown isn't stated. The user's example requires that both grades are mentioned. Since in this case, only one grade (4) is mentioned in the detailed part, but the sum is 8, perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8". Alternatively, if the components aren't both explicitly stated, maybe it's "NA". But the user's instructions say "preferably" the major+minor=sum. So if the sum is given but not the components, perhaps we can still use the sum. Wait, the example given by the user has "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so they can write "4+3=7". If the current case only mentions Gleason 4 and sum 8, but not the secondary grade, then maybe we can't form the major+minor=sum. Therefore, the Gleason field would be "NA". But that seems conflicting because the sum is provided. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be "8" but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Since the user's example uses the components to form the sum, perhaps the correct approach is to only use the components if both are given, otherwise put "NA". But in the given statement, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So the sum is explicitly stated. However, the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is given but not the breakdown, perhaps we can't structure it as per the preferred format. Therefore, the Gleason field would be "NA". But that seems counterintuitive because the sum is known. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be "8" but the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". Since the user's example uses the components, perhaps the answer here is "NA" because the components aren't both specified. But the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the user's instructions again. The allowed values for Gleason are preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements. So if the sum is given but not the breakdown, perhaps the answer is "NA". But in the example, the sum is derived from the components. In the current case, the sum is given directly. So maybe the answer should be "8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Therefore, since the components aren't provided, even though the sum is, the answer is "NA". But that seems incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is provided, even without the components, we can infer the components. For example, if the sum is 8, and one component is 4 (as mentioned in the text), then the other must be 4. So "4+4=8". But that's an assumption. However, the text does mention Gleason 4, so maybe that's the primary, and the secondary is 4. Therefore, the answer would be "4+4=8". But is that a valid approach? The user's instructions don't specify whether to infer components from the sum if one component is mentioned. The example provided by the user includes both components explicitly. Therefore, in this case, since the components aren't both explicitly stated, even though the sum is given, the Gleason field should be "NA". But that might not be correct. Alternatively, the user might expect that if the sum is given, even without components, we can use the sum. But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". So if the sum is 8, but the components aren't given, perhaps the answer is "NA". However, the summary says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which is the most severe lesion. So perhaps the answer should be "4+4=8" because the primary is 4 (as mentioned) and the sum is 8. But the secondary isn't mentioned. Therefore, maybe the answer is "NA". This is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The user's example requires that both components are present in the text. In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 4 in the detailed part and sum 8 in the summary. So the primary is 4, and the sum is 8. Therefore, the secondary must be 4 (4+4=8). But the secondary isn't explicitly mentioned. So can we infer it? The user's instructions don't say whether to infer. The example uses explicit components. Therefore, perhaps the answer is "NA" because the secondary grade isn't mentioned. But the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. However, the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't both given, even if the sum is, then "NA" is the answer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8" but that's not in the required format. Therefore, the correct answer for Gleason is "NA". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "4+4=8" because the sum is 8 and the primary is 4. But the secondary isn't mentioned. Hmm. This is a tough call. Let me check the user's example again. In their example, the statement says "Gleason grades 4 and 3", so they write "4+3=7". If the current case only mentions Gleason 4 and sum 8, but not the secondary grade, then perhaps we can't form the "major+minor=sum" and thus have to put "NA". But the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. Maybe the answer is "8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Therefore, the answer would be "NA". Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even without components, we can put the sum as "sum=8". But the example uses the components. So perhaps the answer is "NA". 

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is TURP (from "turp-chippings").

Malignancy is yes (adenocarcinoma is malignant).

Gleason is "4+4=8" if we infer the secondary grade as 4, but since it's not explicitly stated, maybe "NA". But the summary says "sum 8", which is the total. However, the required format is "major+minor=sum". Since the components aren't both given, the answer is "NA". Wait, but the user's example includes the sum even though the components are given. In this case, the sum is given but not the components. So perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". Therefore, the answer is "NA". 

But wait, the user's instructions say "preferably" in the form of major+minor=sum. So if the sum is given but not the components, maybe we can still use the sum. But the example shows that when components are given, they are used. If the sum is given without components, perhaps the answer is "NA". Alternatively, maybe the answer is "sum 8", but that's not in the format. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Therefore, if the sum is given but not the breakdown, the answer is "NA". 

So final answers:

Sampletype: TURP

Malignancy: yes

Gleason: NA (because the components aren't both specified, even though the sum is 8)
