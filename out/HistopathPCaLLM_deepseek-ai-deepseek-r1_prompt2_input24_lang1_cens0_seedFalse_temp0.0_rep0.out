Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text mentions "turp-lastuja", which I recognize as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. So the sample type here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomaksi", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". However, I need to check if specific Gleason scores (like 4+3=7) are mentioned. The phrase "Gleason 4 -luokan" refers to a primary pattern of 4, but there's no mention of a secondary pattern. The summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total score. But according to the instructions, Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. Since only the total is given as 8 and the major is 4, but minor isn't specified, maybe it's incomplete. Wait, the example required both components. However, the user's example had "4+3=7". Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" in the tumor and the summary says sum 8. But without the minor component, can I infer? Wait, the main part says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might mean primary 4, but the summary says sum 8. If the sum is 8, then possible combinations are 5+3=8 or 4+4=8. But the text only mentions Gleason 4. Maybe the primary is 4 and secondary is 4, making 4+4=8. But the user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's Gleason. However, the example shows that if the sum is given directly, but the required format is major+minor=sum. Since the summary says "pistesumman 8", but the main text mentions Gleason 4, perhaps the major is 4 and minor is 4. But the user might expect the exact format. However, the example in the problem statement uses the exact numbers from the text. Here, the text doesn't explicitly state both components. So maybe the Gleason is "4+4=8"? But the user's example required both parts. Alternatively, if the sum is 8 but the components aren't specified, should it be NA? Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" (malignant findings) should have the Gleason in that format. Since malignancy is yes, but if the components aren't given, maybe we can't fill it. Wait, the example given in the problem statement had "4+3=7" because the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". Here, the text says "Gleason 4 -luokan" and "pistesumman 8". So the sum is 8, but the individual grades are 4 and 4? Or maybe 5+3? But the text doesn't specify. The user's instructions require the format "major+minor=sum". If the individual components aren't mentioned, but the sum is, do we have to leave it as NA? But in the example, the sum was derived from the components. Here, the sum is given as 8, but the components are only partially mentioned. The main text says "Gleason 4", which is the major, but the minor isn't stated. However, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. Since the user's instructions say to report the worst lesion's results, and the components are required, but the text doesn't specify both, perhaps we can't fill in the Gleason. But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which is the total. But the required format is major+minor=sum. If the components aren't given, maybe we can't fill it. But the example in the problem statement had both components. However, in the given input, the main text mentions "Gleason 4" and the summary says sum 8. Maybe the minor is 4 (4+4=8), but the text doesn't explicitly state that. So perhaps the answer should be "4+4=8"? But the user's instructions might require explicit mention of both components. Alternatively, if the sum is given but components are not, maybe it's NA. But the example shows that if the components are mentioned, even if the sum is derived, it's okay. Here, the components are not both mentioned. The main text says "Gleason 4", but the summary says sum 8. So maybe the minor is 4, but it's not stated. Therefore, perhaps the Gleason should be "4+4=8" even if not explicitly stated. But I need to check the original text again. The main part says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua", which could mean that the major pattern is 4. The summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. So if the sum is 8 and major is 4, then minor must be 4 (4+4=8). Therefore, it's safe to assume that. So the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But I need to confirm if the user allows inferred components. The example in the problem statement had explicit components. If the text doesn't mention both, but the sum is given, perhaps the answer is "NA"? Wait, the user's instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the key is "raportoitu" (reported). If the components are not both reported, but the sum is, but the components are not, then perhaps the answer is "NA". But in the example, the sum was derived from the components. Here, the components are not both reported. The main text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says sum 8. So maybe the components are 4 and 4, but they are not explicitly stated. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the components are not both reported, the Gleason should be "NA"? But the sum is reported. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example again. The example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3, so sum 4+3=7". So both components were mentioned. In the current case, the main text mentions "Gleason 4" and the summary says sum 8. The components are not both mentioned. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the components are not both explicitly reported, the Gleason should be "NA". But the sum is given. However, the user's example shows that if the components are given, even if the sum is derived, it's okay. But if the components are not given, even if the sum is, then it's not. Therefore, in this case, since only the major component (4) is mentioned and the sum (8) is given, but the minor component isn't explicitly stated, the Gleason should be "NA". Wait, but the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 8, but the components are not both given, then we can't construct the required format. Therefore, the answer for Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua", which might imply that the major is 4, and the sum is 8. So minor would be 4 (4+4=8). But is that an assumption? The user's instructions require the reported Gleason. If the report doesn't explicitly state both components, even if the sum is given, then we can't fill it. Therefore, in this case, the Gleason would be "NA". But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the summary's "pistesumman 8" is the total, and the main text's "Gleason 4" is the major, so the minor is 4. But the user's example required both to be explicit. Therefore, perhaps the answer is "4+4=8". But I need to check the original text again. The main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua", which translates to "tumor growth of Gleason grade 4". Then the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which is "total score 8 adenocarcinoma". In Gleason scoring, the sum is the sum of the primary and secondary grades. So if the sum is 8 and the primary is 4, then the secondary must be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since both components are not explicitly mentioned, even if the sum is given, the Gleason should be "NA". But the example in the problem statement had both components mentioned. Therefore, in this case, since only the primary is mentioned and the sum is given, but the secondary isn't, the Gleason should be "NA". However, another interpretation is that "pistesumman 8" is the total, and the primary is 4, so the secondary is 4. But the user's instructions require the format to have both components. If the components are not both explicitly stated, then it's "NA". Therefore, the correct answer for Gleason is "NA". But I'm a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the components are not, but the sum can be split into major and minor, then it's acceptable. For example, sum 8 could be 4+4, 5+3, etc. But without knowing the exact components, it's ambiguous. Therefore, according to the instructions, only if both components are explicitly mentioned, then we can report them. Otherwise, "NA". So in this case, since only the primary (4) is mentioned and the sum (8) is given, but the secondary isn't, the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is 8, but the components are not given, then we can't fill it. Therefore, the answer is "NA". 

Wait, but the main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". In Gleason grading, the "luokka" (grade) refers to the individual patterns. However, the current Gleason system uses Grade Groups, but maybe in the context, "Gleason 4" refers to the primary pattern. But the user's example uses the old Gleason score (sum). So perhaps in this case, the primary is 4, and the secondary is 4, leading to 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since both components are not explicitly mentioned, the Gleason should be "NA". 

Alternatively, maybe the term "Gleason 4 -luokan" refers to the Grade Group 4, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 8 (4+4). But the user's example uses the actual components. If the text mentions "Gleason 4" as the primary and the sum is 8, then the secondary is 4. But the user's instructions require the exact components. Therefore, if the components are not both mentioned, it's "NA". 

This is a bit tricky. Let me recheck the user's instructions: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the key is "raportoitu" (reported). If the report doesn't explicitly state both major and minor components, even if the sum is given, then it's "NA". Therefore, in this case, since only the major component (4) is mentioned and the sum (8) is given, but the minor isn't, the Gleason should be "NA". 

Wait, but the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". "Pistesumma" is the total score. So the total is 8, but the components are not given. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the components are not both reported, the Gleason is "NA". 

But the main text mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". "Gleason 4 -luokan" could mean that the tumor is of Gleason grade 4, which in the current system might refer to the primary pattern. But the sum is 8. However, without the secondary pattern, we can't construct the "major+minor=sum" format. Therefore, the answer is "NA". 

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since "turp-lastuja" is mentioned)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinooma)
Gleason: NA (because the components 4+4=8 are not both explicitly stated, only the sum 8 is mentioned in the summary, but the main text mentions Gleason 4, but not the minor component. Alternatively, if the summary's "pistesumman 8" is considered the sum, but the components are not given, then Gleason is NA.)

Wait, but the main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". If "Gleason 4 -luokan" refers to the primary pattern, and the sum is 8, then the secondary is 4. But the user's example required both to be explicitly mentioned. Since in this case, the main text mentions the primary (4) and the summary mentions the sum (8), but not the secondary, perhaps the answer is "4+4=8". But the user's instructions require the exact reported components. If the components are not both reported, then it's NA. 

Alternatively, maybe the term "Gleason 4 -luokan" refers to the Grade Group 4, which is equivalent to Gleason score 8 (4+4). In that case, the components are 4+4, but the text doesn't explicitly state them. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the components are not both mentioned, the answer is "NA". 

This is a bit of a judgment call. But given the user's example, where both components were explicitly mentioned, I think the correct approach is to only include the Gleason if both components are present. Therefore, in this case, since only the primary is mentioned and the sum is given, but the secondary isn't, the Gleason should be "NA". 

Wait, but the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". "Pistesumma" is the total score. If the total is 8, but the components are not given, then according to the user's instructions, the Gleason is "NA". 

But the main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Maybe "Gleason 4" here refers to the sum, but that's not possible because Gleason sum ranges from 6-10. So "Gleason 4" must refer to the primary pattern. Therefore, the primary is 4, and the sum is 8, so the secondary is 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the secondary isn't mentioned, the Gleason is "NA". 

Therefore, the final JSON would be:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the user's example required the components. So if the components are not both mentioned, even if the sum is given, it's "NA". Therefore, the answer is correct as above.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
``` 

**Perustelut:**
1. **Sampletype:** Näyte on merkitty "turp-lastuiksi" (TURP = Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), joten arvo on "TURP".
2. **Malignancy:** Lausunnossa todetaan selvästi adenokarsinooma (pahanlaatuinen) ja viitataan uudelleenarviointiin maligniksi, joten arvo on "kyllä".
3. **Gleason:** Vaikka lausunnossa mainitaan Gleason 4 -luokka ja pistesumma 8, Gleason-luokkaa ei raportoida vaaditussa "major+minor=sum" -muodossa (esim. 4+4=8). Pistesumma 8 viittaa todennäköisesti Gleason-summaan, mutta yksittäisiä komponentteja (major/minor) ei erikseen listata, joten arvo on "NA".
