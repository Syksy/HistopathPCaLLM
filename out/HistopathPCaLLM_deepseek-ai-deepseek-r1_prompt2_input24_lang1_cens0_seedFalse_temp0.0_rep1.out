Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Näytteenä on varmistuksena ajettavaksi n. 10g turp-lastuja..." The term "turp-lastuja" translates to TURP chips. TURP is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate, so the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaksi" which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Also, it refers to "malignin epäilyksen" (suspicion of malignancy) and confirms it as "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi" (adenocarcinoma with a score of 8). So malignancy is definitely present. The answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The text says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". However, the example given in the problem uses the format where specific grades are mentioned, like 4+3=7. Here, the sum is 8, but the individual components (major and minor) aren't explicitly stated. Wait, but earlier in the text, there's "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". So the major pattern is 4. If the sum is 8, then minor would be 4 (since 4+4=8). But the problem states that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. The summary mentions the total score of 8, but does it specify the components? The example in the problem requires both major and minor. If the text only gives the sum, maybe we can't infer the exact components. However, in the example, the sum is derived from the given grades. Here, the text says "Gleason 4" and the sum is 8. Wait, maybe there's a mention of another grade. Let me check again. The main part says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". So if the major is 4 and the sum is 8, the minor must be 4 (4+4=8). Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+4=8". But I need to confirm if the text explicitly states both components. If it only mentions Gleason 4 and sum 8, maybe the minor is 4. Alternatively, maybe the report only states the sum. But according to the problem's instructions, the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the sum is provided but the individual grades aren't, should we put NA? But in the example, the sum is derived from the given grades. Here, the user might have to infer. Since the main tumor is Gleason 4 and the sum is 8, it's logical that 4+4=8. But I need to check if the text actually mentions both grades. The text says "Gleason 4" in the main part and "pistesumman 8" in the summary. So maybe the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't specified. Wait, but in the example, the sum is 7 from 4+3. So the user expects the major and minor to be extracted. If the text here only gives the sum, but not the individual components, then according to the problem's instructions, maybe we should put "NA"? But the example shows that when the sum is derived from the components, it's included. However, in this case, the sum is given as 8, but the components are not explicitly stated. The problem says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the report states the sum but not the components, do we have to leave it as NA? Wait, the example in the problem has the components and the sum. The user's instructions say that the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the components are not mentioned, but the sum is, can we still report the sum? The problem says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the sum is reported, even without the components, maybe we should use that. But the example requires the components. Let me check the example again. The example sentence mentions "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7", so they have both components and the sum. The user's instructions say that the answer should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the text only gives the sum, but not the components, then according to the problem's rules, maybe we can't include it. However, in the given text, the main part says "Gleason 4" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". So maybe the major is 4, and the sum is 8, implying minor is 4. But is that an assumption? The problem states that only the worst lesion's results should be reported. If the report mentions Gleason 4 in the main part and the sum is 8, perhaps the minor is 4. But the problem requires the reported Gleason as per the text. If the text doesn't explicitly state both components, then maybe we can't include them. However, in the summary, it's stated as "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which translates to "score sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't mentioned. Therefore, according to the problem's instructions, since the components aren't given, maybe the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the example shows that when the sum is derived from components, it's included. Here, the sum is given directly. The problem's allowed values for Gleason are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". If the sum is reported but not the components, can we still put the sum? For example, if the report says "Gleason score 8", but doesn't break it into 4+4 or 5+3, then according to the problem's instructions, should we put "NA" because the components aren't specified? The example requires both components and the sum. Therefore, in this case, since the components (4 and 4) aren't explicitly stated together, even though the main part mentions Gleason 4 and the sum is 8, we might have to put "NA". But that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the summary's "pistesumman 8" is the total, and the main part's "Gleason 4" is the major component, so minor would be 4. But the problem says to take the pahin (worst) lesion's results. If the main lesion is Gleason 4 and the sum is 8, then the minor must be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. So perhaps the correct approach is to report "4+4=8" because the sum is 8 and the major component is 4. But I need to check if the text actually mentions both. The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" (Gleason grade 4 tumor growth) and in the summary "pistesumman 8". So the sum is 8, but the individual grades aren't both stated. Therefore, according to the problem's instructions, since the components aren't both mentioned, maybe the Gleason should be "NA". But that contradicts the example where the components are mentioned. Alternatively, maybe in this case, the sum is given, and even if the components aren't explicitly stated, we can infer them. But the problem says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" (reported Gleason grade). If the report only states the sum, but not the components, then according to the allowed values, it should be "NA". However, in the example, the sum is derived from the components. Here, the sum is given directly. So perhaps in this case, the answer should be "NA" for Gleason, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, the problem's third field says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if the malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason should be in the "major+minor=sum" format. If the components are not reported, but the sum is, but the components can be inferred, then perhaps we can use that. But the problem requires the reported Gleason. If the report only mentions the sum, but not the individual grades, then according to the problem's rules, we can't assume the components. Therefore, in this case, since the sum is 8 but the individual grades aren't specified, the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the example in the problem includes the sum even though the components are mentioned. So if the components are mentioned, sum is derived. If the sum is mentioned but not the components, then perhaps it's not allowed. However, in the given text, the main part mentions Gleason 4, and the summary mentions sum 8. So maybe the major is 4 and the minor is 4, making the sum 8. But the text doesn't explicitly state both. So is it acceptable to infer? The problem says "raportoitu" (reported), so we can only use what's explicitly stated. Therefore, since the individual grades (4 and 4) aren't both reported, but the sum is, perhaps the answer is "NA". But that seems incorrect because the sum is reported. Alternatively, maybe the answer should be "4+4=8" because the major is 4 and the sum is 8. But the problem's example requires both components to be mentioned. In the example, the components are 4 and 3, sum 7. So if the text here mentions sum 8 and major 4, but not the minor, then perhaps we can't fill in the minor. Therefore, the Gleason would be "NA". But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "4+4=8" because the major is 4 and the sum is 8, even if the minor isn't explicitly stated. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again. The user says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the format must be "major+minor=sum". If the report doesn't mention both major and minor, even if the sum is given, then it's "NA". But in this case, the report mentions Gleason 4 (major) and sum 8, so minor would be 4. But is that inferred? The problem says to use only the reported data, not to infer. Therefore, if the minor isn't mentioned, even if the sum is given, we can't assume it. Therefore, the Gleason should be "NA". But that seems wrong because the sum is explicitly stated. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me look at the example again. The example sentence says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So both components are mentioned, and the sum is derived. In the current case, the components are not both mentioned. The main part says "Gleason 4", and the summary says sum 8. So the major is 4, but the minor isn't stated. Therefore, according to the problem's rules, since both components aren't reported, the Gleason should be "NA". But the sum is reported. However, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum". If the sum is reported but not the components, then it's not in the correct format, so "NA". Therefore, in this case, the Gleason would be "NA". But that seems incorrect because the sum is known. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "4+4=8" because the major is 4 and the sum is 8. But the problem requires the reported values. If the minor isn't reported, we can't include it. Therefore, the correct answer is "NA" for Gleason. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The user's instructions say: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the report states the sum but not the components, but the sum is derived from the components (even if not explicitly stated), then perhaps we can't include it. For example, if the report says "Gleason score 8", but doesn't break it into major and minor, then according to the problem's rules, it's "NA". But in this case, the report mentions "Gleason 4" in the main part and "sum 8" in the summary. So maybe the major is 4 and the minor is 4, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, we can't assume that. So the answer for Gleason is "NA". But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the summary's "pistesumman 8" (score sum 8) is the total, and since the main part mentions Gleason 4, maybe the minor is 4. But the problem requires the reported values. If the report doesn't explicitly state both, then it's "NA". Therefore, the answer would be:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's turp-lastuja)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinooma)
Gleason: NA (because the individual components aren't both reported, only the sum is mentioned)

But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". "Pistesumma" is the total score. So the sum is 8, but the components aren't given. Therefore, according to the problem's instructions, since the components aren't reported, the Gleason should be "NA". Even though the sum is known, the required format is "major+minor=sum", which isn't possible here. Therefore, the answer is "NA" for Gleason. But in the example, the components are mentioned, so the sum is included. Here, the components aren't both mentioned, so it's "NA". 

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but the summary says "pistesumman 8". If "pistesumma" is the total Gleason score, then maybe the answer should be "4+4=8" because the main part mentions Gleason 4. But the problem requires the reported Gleason in the format. If the report doesn't explicitly state both grades, even if one is mentioned and the sum is given, we can't assume the other. Therefore, the correct answer is "NA" for Gleason. 

Yes, that makes sense. The problem's example requires both components to be present in the text. Here, only one component (4) and the sum (8) are mentioned, but the minor component isn't explicitly stated. Therefore, we can't format it as "4+4=8" because the minor isn't reported. Hence, "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "NA"
} 

**Perustelut:**
1. **Sampletype:** Tekstissä mainitaan "turp-lastuja", joka viittaa TURP-näytteeseen (transurethraalinen resectio).
2. **Malignancy:** Lausunnossa todetaan adenokarsinooma (pahanlaatuinen) ja malignin epäilyksen vahvistuminen.
3. **Gleason:** Yhteenvedossa mainitaan pistesumma 8, mutta Gleason-luokan yksittäisiä komponentteja (esim. 4+4) ei raportoida eksplisiittisesti, joten arvo on "NA".
