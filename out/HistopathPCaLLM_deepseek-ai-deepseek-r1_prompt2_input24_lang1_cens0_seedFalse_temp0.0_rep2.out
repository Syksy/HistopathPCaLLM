Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on varmistuksena ajettavaksi n. 10g turp-lastuja..." The term "turp-lastuja" refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) chips. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaksi" which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Also, "pistesumman 8" indicates a Gleason score, which is related to cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report states "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". However, the example given in the instructions uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text here just mentions the sum as 8, but doesn't specify the individual grades. But earlier, there's "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Wait, if it's Gleason 4, but the sum is 8, maybe there's a combination. However, the exact components (like 4+4=8) aren't explicitly stated. But in the YHTEENVETO (summary), it's "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". The problem is whether the individual grades are mentioned. The example requires major+minor=sum. If the sum is 8 but the components aren't given, should we put NA? Wait, the user instructions say for Gleason: "summa 4+3=7" format. If the text only gives the sum, but not the components, then according to the example, maybe we can't include it. But in the given text, there's "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might refer to a primary pattern of 4, but the secondary isn't mentioned. However, the summary says sum 8. If the sum is 8, and the primary is 4, then secondary would be 4 (4+4=8). But the text doesn't explicitly state that. The user's instructions require the format "major+minor=sum". If the components are not specified, even if the sum is given, should we put NA? Wait, in the example, the user had "4+3=7" because the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" but the sum is 8. So maybe the primary is 4 and secondary is 4, but the text doesn't explicitly state both. Therefore, according to the strict rules, if the individual grades aren't given, even if the sum is mentioned, we can't construct the "major+minor=sum" format. But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. However, the example requires the sum to be in the format with major and minor components. If the components aren't specified, then perhaps we can't fill it and have to put NA. But that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user allows the sum even if the components aren't given. Let me check the instructions again. The user says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the format must be "major+minor=sum". If the report only gives the sum but not the individual grades, then we can't form that string. However, in the example, the sum is derived from the individual grades. Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" in the tumor growth, but the summary says sum 8. If the primary is 4 and the secondary is 4, then it's 4+4=8. But does the text explicitly state both? The first part says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might refer to the primary pattern. Then in the summary, the sum is 8. So maybe the secondary is 4. But the problem is whether the text explicitly states both components. If not, then according to the instructions, we can't assume. Therefore, even though the sum is 8, if the individual grades aren't mentioned, the Gleason field should be NA. But wait, the example given in the problem includes a case where the sum is derived from the individual grades. So if the text only mentions the sum, but not the individual grades, then we can't construct the required format and must put NA. However, in the given input, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". The term "pistesumma" refers to the total score. But the user's example requires the format with major and minor. Therefore, if the individual components (4+4) aren't mentioned, even if the sum is 8, we can't create the "4+4=8" string. Therefore, the Gleason field would be NA. But wait, the text earlier mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Does that mean the major pattern is 4? If so, and the sum is 8, then the minor would be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. So perhaps the correct answer is to put "4+4=8" even if it's inferred. But according to the instructions, the user wants the reported Gleason grade. If the report doesn't state both components, then we can't assume. Therefore, the answer for Gleason would be NA. But this is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the example again. In the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so they have both components. Here, the text mentions "Gleason 4" and sum 8, but not the other component. So perhaps the answer is NA. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the components aren't, we can infer. But according to the strict instructions, the format must be "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't reported, then it's NA. Therefore, in this case, since the components aren't both mentioned, Gleason would be NA. But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the user's example requires the sum to be in the format with the components. So if the components aren't given, even if the sum is, we can't format it correctly. Therefore, the answer for Gleason is NA. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the term "Gleason 4" refers to the primary pattern, and the sum is 8, so secondary is 4. Then it's 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. So maybe the answer is "4+4=8". But the user's instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka", so it has to be as reported. If the report doesn't mention both, then we can't include it. Therefore, the correct answer would be "NA" for Gleason. But this is a bit confusing. Let me read the input again.

The input says: "Lastuissa havaitaan >50%:ssa yhteensulaneina asinuksina kasvavaa Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua." So the tumor is Gleason 4. Then in the summary: "YHTEENVETO: Aiemmin benigniksi luokiteltu mutta malignin epäilyksen jättänyt höyläysnäyte arvioidaan uusiksi siis pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi." So the total score is 8. But the components (4+4) are not explicitly stated. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the format requires "major+minor=sum", and the individual components aren't provided, even if the sum is, the Gleason should be "NA". But wait, the initial mention of Gleason 4 could be the major component, and the sum is 8, implying minor is 4. But the problem is whether the report explicitly states both. If not, then we can't assume. Therefore, the answer for Gleason is "NA". But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the components aren't, we can put "sum=8", but the format requires "major+minor=sum". So without the components, it's invalid. Therefore, the correct answer is "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
``` 

**Rationale:**  
1. **Sampletype:** The text specifies "turp-lastuja" (TURP chips), indicating a TURP sample.  
2. **Malignancy:** The summary confirms adenocarcinoma (malignancy) with a Gleason score.  
3. **Gleason:** Although the total score (8) is mentioned, the required "major+minor=sum" format is not explicitly provided (only "Gleason 4" and "summa 8" are noted separately). Thus, the structured format cannot be derived.
