Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "turp-lastuja" which translates to TURP chips. TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The report states "adenokarsinoomaksi" which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi" which translates to a score of 8. However, the example requires the format like "4+3=7". The user might need to check if the components are mentioned. The text also says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" (Gleason grade 4 tumor growth). But the summary says the total is 8. If only the total is given without the individual grades, does that count? The example shows both components and sum. But the user's instructions say to report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't specified, maybe we can't infer them. However, in the example, the sum is derived from the components. Here, the summary says "pistesumman 8" (score 8), but the components aren't explicitly stated. Wait, earlier in the text, it mentions Gleason 4, but maybe that's the major component. If the total is 8, and major is 4, then minor would be 4 (4+4=8). But is that a valid assumption? The user's example uses the explicit components given in the text. In this case, the text says "Gleason 4" but the summary says total 8. Maybe there's a mention of another component elsewhere. Let me check again. The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and in the summary "pistesumman 8". If the major is 4 and minor is 4, then 4+4=8. But the user's instructions require the format with major and minor. If the components aren't explicitly stated, should we put NA? But the example allowed it when the sum was derived from components. Here, the user might expect "4+4=8" even if it's inferred. Alternatively, if the components aren't both mentioned, maybe it's NA. But the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. However, the user's example required both parts. So perhaps in this case, since only the total is given, but the major component is mentioned as 4, but minor isn't, maybe we can't form the sum. Wait, the example had "4+3=7" because the text said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". Here, the text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says total 8. So maybe the minor is 4. But without explicit mention, should we assume? The user's instructions say "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the report only states the total sum, but not the individual grades, then according to the example, we need to have major+minor=sum. If the individual grades aren't reported, perhaps we can't fill it and have to put NA. But in this case, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. However, the example required both parts. So maybe here, since the total is 8 but the components aren't explicitly stated as 4+4, we can't format it as "4+4=8" unless the text says so. Wait, the text does mention "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might be the major component, but the minor isn't stated. So perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8" if the total is 8 and major is 4. But I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the total is given, but the components aren't, then we can't format it properly and have to put NA. But in the example, the components were explicitly stated. Here, the components are not both given. The text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says total 8. So maybe the minor is 4, but it's not explicitly stated. The user's instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" in the format "major+minor=sum". If the report doesn't state both, then perhaps it's NA. But the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi", which is the total. However, the example required the components. So in this case, since the components aren't both mentioned, maybe the Gleason should be NA. But that contradicts the summary's total. Alternatively, maybe the user allows the sum even if the components aren't explicitly stated. But according to the example, the format must be "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't given, even if the sum is, then it's NA. Wait, the example's input had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7", so both components and sum were mentioned. Here, the input mentions "Gleason 4" and the sum is 8. So maybe the minor component is 4, but it's not explicitly stated. However, the user's instructions require the format with major and minor. If the report doesn't specify both, then according to the rules, it should be NA. But the summary says the total is 8. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the user's instructions again: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So the value should be in the format "major+minor=sum" as integers. If the report only states the sum but not the individual components, then perhaps it's not in the correct format and should be NA. However, in the example, the sum was derived from the components. Here, the components are not both given. The text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says sum 8. So maybe the minor is 4, but it's not explicitly stated. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since the components aren't both reported, the Gleason should be NA. But that seems counterintuitive because the sum is given. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the components aren't, we can format it as "sum=sum", but that's not the case. The example requires both components. Therefore, in this case, since the components aren't both explicitly stated, the Gleason should be NA. But wait, the summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. But the user's example required the components. So perhaps the answer here is "NA" for Gleason. But that doesn't make sense because the sum is known. Alternatively, maybe the user allows the sum even if the components aren't given. But according to the instructions, the format must be "major+minor=sum". If the components aren't given, even if the sum is, then it's not in the correct format and should be NA. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The user's example shows that when the components are given (4 and 3), the sum is 7, so the format is "4+3=7". In the current case, the text mentions Gleason 4 (major) and the sum is 8. If the minor is 4, then it's 4+4=8, but the text doesn't explicitly state the minor component. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, since both components aren't reported, the Gleason should be NA. But the summary says the sum is 8. However, the user's instructions require the format with major and minor. Therefore, if the components aren't both present, it's NA. But that seems conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even without components, we can put "sum=sum", but that's not the case. The example requires components. Therefore, in this case, since the components aren't both given, the Gleason should be NA. But the summary says the sum is 8. Wait, but the user's instructions say "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the report states the sum as 8, even without components, then maybe the answer is "8" but the required format is "major+minor=sum". Therefore, since the format isn't met, it's NA. But that's not ideal. Alternatively, maybe the user allows the sum alone. But according to the example, the format must include the components. Therefore, in this case, the Gleason should be "4+4=8" if the major is 4 and the sum is 8. But the text mentions "Gleason 4" and the sum is 8. So maybe the minor is 4. But is that a valid assumption? In real medical terms, Gleason score is the sum of the two most prevalent grades. If the major is 4 and the sum is 8, then the minor must be 4. But the text doesn't explicitly state that. However, in the summary, it's stated as "pistesumman 8", which is the total. So perhaps the correct answer is "4+4=8" even if the minor isn't explicitly mentioned, because the major is 4 and the total is 8. But I'm not sure. The user's example required both components to be mentioned. In the given text, the components are not both mentioned. Therefore, according to the user's instructions, the Gleason should be NA. But that seems incorrect because the sum is known. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that if the sum is given, even if the components aren't, we can infer them. But that's risky. The safe answer here is to put "4+4=8" because the major is 4 and the sum is 8, implying the minor is 4. But I need to check if the text explicitly mentions both. The text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which refers to the major component. The summary says "pistesumman 8", which is the total. So the minor must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But the user's example required both components to be explicitly stated. In this case, the minor isn't explicitly stated. So maybe the answer is NA. But that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user allows the sum to be reported even if the components are inferred. I think in this case, since the major is 4 and the sum is 8, the minor is 4, so the answer should be "4+4=8". Therefore, the JSON would have Gleason as "4+4=8".
