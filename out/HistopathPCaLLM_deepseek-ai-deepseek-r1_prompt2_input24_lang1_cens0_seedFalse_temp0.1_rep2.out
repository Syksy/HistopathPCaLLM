Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the example and the instructions again to make sure I understand correctly.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text starts with "Näytteenä on varmistuksena ajettavaksi n. 10g turp-lastuja". The term "turp-lastuja" refers to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) chips. So the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "adenokarsinoomaksi", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Also, the summary states "malignin epäilyksen jättänyt höyläysnäyte arvioidaan uusiksi siis pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". So clearly malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The example had "4+3=7". In the given text, the summary says "pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi". However, earlier in the report, it mentions "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua". Wait, but the summary says pistesumma 8. Gleason score is the sum of the primary and secondary grades. If the sum is 8, possible combinations are 4+4, 5+3, 3+5. But the text mentions Gleason 4, but the summary says sum 8. Hmm. Wait, the text says "Lastuissa havaitaan >50%:ssa yhteensulaneina asinuksina kasvavaa Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua." So primary pattern 4. Then in the summary, "pistesumman 8". So 4 + 4 = 8? But the user wants major and minor components. So if the sum is 8 and the major is 4, then minor would be 4. So "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text explicitly states both components. The text mentions Gleason 4, but maybe the sum is 8. However, the example given in the problem uses the specific mention of both grades (4 and 3) to form the sum. Here, the summary says the sum is 8, but the main text mentions Gleason 4. If the sum is 8 and the primary is 4, then secondary must be 4. But does the text confirm that? Let me check again. The main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might refer to the primary grade. Then the summary says "pistesumman 8". So combining these, the Gleason would be 4+4=8. But I need to make sure that the minor component is also 4. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention the minor component. Wait, the example given in the problem had both grades mentioned (4 and 3), so the user expects both to be present. In this case, the summary mentions the sum as 8, but the main text only mentions Gleason 4. So perhaps the minor is 4? Or maybe the report only states the sum. But according to the instructions, the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. If the sum is 8 and the major is 4, then minor must be 4. But if the report only mentions the sum and the major, but not the minor, is that acceptable? The example required both grades to be present. In the current case, the main text says Gleason 4, and the summary says sum 8. So maybe the minor is 4. Alternatively, perhaps the report is combining the grades as 4 and 4. So the answer would be "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text provides both components. The user's instructions say that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the Gleason should be in the format with major and minor. If the text doesn't specify both, but the sum is given, can we infer? The example had both components. In the problem statement, the user says that the Gleason should be in "major+minor=sum" format. So if the sum is 8 and the major is 4, then minor is 4. But if the text only mentions the major, but the sum is given, perhaps we can assume the minor. However, maybe the report mentions the sum as 8 but doesn't break it down. In that case, according to the instructions, should we put "NA"? Wait, no. The instructions say for malignant findings, the Gleason should be in that format, and "NA" for benign. Since this is malignant, we need to provide the Gleason. If the sum is given but the components aren't, but the main text mentions Gleason 4, perhaps the primary is 4 and the secondary is 4. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 8 but the components are 5+3. But the text doesn't say that. The example required both components to be present. So in this case, the summary says sum 8, but the main text mentions Gleason 4. If the components aren't explicitly stated, should we put "NA"? But the user's example allowed the components to be extracted from the text. Here, the components are not both explicitly stated, but the sum is. However, the problem says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" which is the reported Gleason grade. If the report states the sum as 8 but not the individual components, but mentions Gleason 4, perhaps the components are 4 and 4. But maybe the components are 5 and 3, but the main text only mentions 4. This is a bit ambiguous. However, according to the example, if the components are mentioned, they are used. If not, but the sum is given, perhaps we can't infer. Wait, the example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which explicitly states both. In the current case, the main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" and the summary says "pistesumman 8". So the sum is 8, but the primary is 4. If the primary is 4 and the sum is 8, then the secondary must be 4. Therefore, the Gleason would be 4+4=8. But the text doesn't explicitly state the secondary grade. However, the summary mentions the sum, and the main text mentions the primary. So perhaps in this case, the user expects us to use the sum and the primary to infer the secondary. Alternatively, maybe the report is inconsistent. But according to the instructions, we should report the Gleason as "major+minor=sum". If the sum is given and the major is given, but the minor isn't, but the sum is major + minor, then we can calculate the minor. But is that acceptable? The example required both to be present. In the absence of explicit mention of both, perhaps we should put "NA"? But the user's instructions say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". If the sum is reported as 8, but the components aren't, but the main text mentions Gleason 4, perhaps the components are 4 and 4. Alternatively, maybe the report is using the sum without breaking it down. In that case, perhaps the Gleason is "4+4=8". But I need to check if the text allows that. The main text says "Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua" which might refer to the primary pattern. Then the summary says sum 8. So combining these, it's 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason would be "4+4=8". But I need to be careful here. If the text doesn't explicitly mention both grades, but the sum is given, is it acceptable to infer? The example required both to be present. However, in the user's instructions, they said "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). So perhaps the worst lesion has Gleason 4+4=8. Therefore, the answer would be "4+4=8". So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's turp-lastuja)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenokarsinooma)
Gleason: 4+4=8

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
