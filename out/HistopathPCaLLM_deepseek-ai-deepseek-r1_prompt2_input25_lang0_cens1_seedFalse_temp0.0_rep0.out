Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "tissue samples" but there's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The samples are labeled (1), (2), (3), but the type isn't specified. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The options are yes, no, or NA. The conclusion states that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma can't be reliably verified. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and previous suspicions (PIN changes) were retracted, Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the report mentions that in sample (1), Gleason differentiation patterns were assessed, but due to differing views, it's going to be discussed later. However, the conclusion is that they can't verify the presence of cancer. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, there's no valid Gleason score. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the report is inconclusive and doesn't provide definitive information for any of the categories.
