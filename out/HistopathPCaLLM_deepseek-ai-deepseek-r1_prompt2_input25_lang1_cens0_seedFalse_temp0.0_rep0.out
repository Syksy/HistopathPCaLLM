Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down the given text and see what each part means.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" which translates to sample. The examples given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the samples are numbered (1), (2), and (3). The report mentions "näytteistä" (from the samples) and "prostatan adenokarsinooma" (prostate adenocarcinoma), but there's no explicit mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. However, in medical contexts, when samples are taken as numbered pieces and discussed in terms of cancer presence, it's often a biopsy. The example provided in the problem also used "biopsy" for a similar context. So I'll go with "biopsy" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text clearly states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which means "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is diagnosed from the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers, or NA if benign. The report mentions Gleason 4 in sample (1) with 20% and 3 (30%), and in sample (2) Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (35%). The problem states to report the worst lesion's Gleason. Gleason grading is based on the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (second most prevalent) patterns. However, in some cases, when there's tertiary (third) pattern of higher grade, that might affect the score. But here, both samples (1) and (2) have Gleason 4 and 3. The primary pattern is the higher grade, so for each sample, it's 4+3=7. Since sample (1) and (2) both have 4+3=7, but the worst would still be 4+3=7. However, I need to check if there's a higher sum. Both are 7. The percentages are 20% and 15% for Gleason 4, but the grade is determined by the patterns, not the percentage. So the highest Gleason here is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

Wait, but the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which means the worst lesion's results. So even if there are multiple samples, we take the worst one. Both samples (1) and (2) have 4+3=7. So the worst is 4+3=7. So the answer is correct.

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's samples taken, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 4+3=7 (highest Gleason score from the samples)
