Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided report, the samples are referred to as "näyte" which translates to "sample" in Finnish. The report mentions "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but in the current case, the samples are labeled as (1), (2), and (3). The term "biopsiasta" isn't explicitly here, but the context of multiple samples with lengths and descriptions of cores suggests biopsy samples. There's no mention of RP or TURP, so the sample type is likely "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Todetaan em. näytteistä siis prostatan adenokarsinooma," which translates to "Thus, adenocarcinoma of the prostate is confirmed in the aforementioned samples." Adenocarcinoma is malignant, so malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions specify to take the worst (pahimman) lesion. In sample (1), Gleason 4 is mentioned with 20% and 3 with 30%. The primary pattern is the higher grade, so here it's 4 (major) + 3 (minor) = 7. Sample (2) also has Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (35%), which is the same combination 4+3=7. Since both samples (1) and (2) have the same highest Gleason score, the worst is 4+3=7. Sample (3) has no malignancy.

The example provided uses "4+3=7" as the format, so we follow that. Even though the percentages are different, the Gleason grade is based on the patterns, not the percentages. So the correct Gleason entry is "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's Gleason. All three fields are accounted for correctly here.

 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
