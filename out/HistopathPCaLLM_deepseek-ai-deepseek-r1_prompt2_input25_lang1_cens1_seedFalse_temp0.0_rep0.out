Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the samples are referred to as "näyte" (Finnish for sample) with numbers (1), (2), (3). The text mentions "prostatan adenokarsinooma -löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa" which translates to the prostate adenocarcinoma finding couldn't be reliably confirmed. However, there's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example given in the problem where the sample type was "biopsy" had the word "biopsiasta" (from biopsy). Here, the samples are just numbered, and there's no indication of the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states that the presence of adenocarcinoma couldn't be reliably confirmed or ruled out. The initial suspicion of PIN changes (which are premalignant) was later retracted as unreliable. So there's no confirmation of malignancy. The possible values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since the report says it can't confirm or deny, but there's no definite malignant findings, maybe "ei"? Wait, but the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the conclusion is that it can't be confirmed or denied, does that mean there's no confirmed malignancy? The example where malignancy was "kyllä" had a clear mention of adenocarcinoma. Here, since it's uncertain, maybe the answer is "ei" because they couldn't confirm it. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. The example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. In this case, the report is valid but inconclusive. The problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). Since the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed, there's no malignancy found, so "ei". But wait, maybe the samples had some suspicious findings but couldn't confirm. The initial thought was PIN, which is not malignant, and that was retracted. So the final answer is that there's no malignancy. So Malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The text mentions that in sample (1), they tried to evaluate Gleason differentiation patterns but due to differing opinions, it's to be assessed in a uro-meeting. There's no actual Gleason score reported here. The example had a clear "4+3=7". Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. Even if there was an attempt to assess, since the malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because they couldn't confirm adenocarcinoma. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy and no reported score.
