Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input is a bit complex, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Näyte (1)", "Näyte (2)", and "Näyte (3)". The possible values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report doesn't specify the sample type like biopsy or RP. It just refers to "näyte" which is sample. Since there's no explicit mention of the procedure type, I should mark Sampletype as NA.

Next, malignancy. The key part here is "prostatan adenokarsinooma -löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota." So, they can't confirm or rule out adenocarcinoma. That means there's no definitive malignant findings. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since it's uncertain, maybe Malignancy should be NA. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't confirm, does that mean the sample doesn't have clear malignancy? The instructions say "pahimman leesion" so maybe if there's uncertainty, it's considered not confirmed. But the example given in the problem where malignancy is "kyllä" had a clear mention. Here, since it's uncertain, perhaps Malignancy is "ei"? Wait, no. The user instruction says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the conclusion is that it can't be confirmed or denied, then there's no definitive malignant findings. So maybe Malignancy is "ei"? Or is it NA? The example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. Here, the report is valid but inconclusive. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei"? But the system might expect NA for uncertain cases. Hmm. The example given in the problem where malignancy was NA was when the text was gibberish. In the example with a valid report, they had a clear "adenokarsinoomaa" so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed or denied, so there's no malignancy found. So maybe Malignancy is "ei"? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" which implies the worst finding. If the worst is inconclusive, perhaps it's NA. But the options are only kyllä, ei, NA. Since the report says they can't confirm or deny, maybe Malignancy is NA. Because "ei" would mean no malignancy was found, but here it's uncertain. So NA is more appropriate.

Third, Gleason. The text mentions "Gleason erilaistumispatterniensa suhteen" but due to differing opinions, it's to be evaluated in a meeting. There's no actual Gleason score provided. Also, the conclusion is that adenocarcinoma can't be confirmed, so if there's no malignancy, Gleason would be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason patterns, if malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason is NA. So in this case, since malignancy is NA (or "ei"), Gleason would be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive. Gleason is NA because no score is given and malignancy isn't confirmed.
