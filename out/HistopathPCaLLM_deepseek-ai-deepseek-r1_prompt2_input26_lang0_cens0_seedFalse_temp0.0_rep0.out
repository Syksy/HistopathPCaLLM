Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate..." So prostatectomy indicates that the sample type is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor..." The presence of a tumor here is malignant, so the answer should be yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The statement says, "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." So the major component is 3, and the minor is 4. The sum would be 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The largest tumor focus is on the basis side, which is where the Gleason 3 and 4 are mentioned. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere, so this is the most severe.

No nested structures in the JSON, just flat keys. Let me double-check each part. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. All the required fields are covered, and the values are within the allowed options. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
