Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first line mentions "prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy typically refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP would be the correct sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP."

Next, determining Malignancy. The report states there's a "widely spread tumor" and mentions "positive margins." The presence of a tumor indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants the format "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. The text says, "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." Dominant would be the major pattern, so 4, and the minor is 3. Wait, no—wait, the dominant is class 3, but class 4 is almost as prevalent. Wait, in Gleason grading, the primary (major) pattern is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. If the dominant is 3, but class 4 is almost as prevalent, does that mean the major is 3 and minor is 4? Because the primary is the most prevalent, even if another grade is almost as common. So the sum would be 3+4=7. The example given in the instructions uses 4+3=7, but here it's 3+4. So the correct format would be "3+4=7."

Wait, but the user's example has the higher grade first. Let me check the actual guidelines. In Gleason scoring, the primary grade (the most extensive pattern) is listed first, followed by the secondary grade (the next most common). So if the dominant is 3, but 4 is almost as prevalent, then primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7."

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (from prostatectomy)
Malignancy: yes (tumor present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. The largest tumor focus is on the basis side, which is where the Gleason 3 and 4 are mentioned. So that's the most severe. No tertiary patterns mentioned here. So the answer should be as above.
