Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task. The user provided a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer, and I need to extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". I remember that "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is typically a radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So "prostatektomiapreparaatti" should map to "RP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "laaja kasvain" (extensive tumor) and mentions Gleason grades, which are indicators of cancer. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the key part is "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". The primary pattern is 3, and secondary is 4. The sum is 3+4=7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example given uses "biopsy" for a biopsy sample, so here "RP" is correct. The malignancy is confirmed by the presence of a tumor and Gleason scores. The Gleason is correctly formatted as per the major and minor components. No other lesions are mentioned that are worse, so this should be the correct data.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
