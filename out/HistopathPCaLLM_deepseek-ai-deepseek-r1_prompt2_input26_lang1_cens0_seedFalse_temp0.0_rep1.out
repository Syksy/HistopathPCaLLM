Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Tutkittavana on prostatektomiapreparaatti..." which translates to "The specimen under examination is a prostatectomy preparation..." So prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a prostatectomy specimen. Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "laaja kasvain" which means "extensive tumor" and "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive margins), and also talks about Gleason grades. So clearly malignant. The answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to report the major + minor = sum format. The text states "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." The dominant (major) is 3, and class 4 differentiation is almost as much. Wait, but Gleason grading is based on the primary (most predominant) and secondary (next most predominant) patterns. If grade 3 is the most and grade 4 is the next, even if they are almost equal, the primary would be 4 if it's the higher grade? Wait, no. Wait, the current Gleason system (Grade Groups) considers the primary and secondary patterns, but the sum is primary + secondary. However, in cases where the highest grade is present, even if it's less than 5% but higher than the primary, there's a rule. Wait, but the user's example shows that if the major is 4 and minor is 3, it's 4+3=7.

In the given text, "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3" means the predominant is 3, and "luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon" – class 4 differentiation almost as much. So the primary pattern is 3, secondary is 4. So the sum would be 3+4=7. But wait, the way it's phrased: "melkein yhtä paljon" (almost as much). But in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next, regardless of which is higher. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the primary is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary is the next most prevalent. However, if the highest grade (even if less than 5%) is present, there's a rule. But in this case, the primary is 3, and the secondary is 4. So the sum is 3+4=7. But the example given in the problem statement was 4+3=7. So the order matters. The major is the higher grade if there are two patterns. Wait, no. Wait, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. So if the most common is 3 and the next is 4, then it's 3+4=7. But sometimes, if the highest grade is present, even in a small amount, it's considered. Wait, but according to current guidelines, the primary is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the next most prevalent. So in this case, the primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score is 3+4=7. However, the user's example had 4+3=7, which would be primary 4 and secondary 3. So the order here is important. The text says "vallitseva" (dominant) is 3, and class 4 is almost as much. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. Therefore, the sum is 3+4=7. But I need to check if the phrasing here could mean that the major is 4. Wait, "vallitseva" is the dominant, which is 3, and then there's class 4 differentiation almost as much. So the primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the correct Gleason would be 3+4=7. But wait, sometimes when there's a higher grade present, even if it's not the most prevalent, but if it's a significant amount, it might be considered. But according to standard scoring, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next. So in this case, 3+4=7. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the text says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." So the primary is 3, and the amount of 4 is almost as much. So the secondary is 4. Therefore, 3+4=7. So the Gleason is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (since it's a prostatectomy specimen)

Malignancy: kyllä (yes, because there's a tumor and positive margins)

Gleason: 3+4=7

I need to make sure that the JSON keys are correct and that the values are exactly as per the allowed options. Also, no nested structures. The example given uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". So the order in Gleason is major + minor. So in this case, major is 3, minor is 4. So 3+4=7. That's correct.
