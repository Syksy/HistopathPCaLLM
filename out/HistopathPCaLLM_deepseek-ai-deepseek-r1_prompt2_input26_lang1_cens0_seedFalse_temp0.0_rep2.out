Okay, let's tackle this JSON structuring task based on the given pathology report. First, I need to extract the three required fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

Starting with Sampletype. The report mentions "prostatektomiapreparaatti". The Finnish term "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the prostate gland. In the allowed values, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so that should be the sample type here. So Sampletype is "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The text states "laaja kasvain" (extensive tumor) and mentions Gleason grades, which are indicators of prostate cancer. There's also a mention of "positiiviset reunamarginaalit" (positive surgical margins), which suggests malignancy. So the answer here should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the report says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon". The primary pattern is 3, and the secondary is 4. The sum would be 3+4=7. The correct format is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. The example provided uses the biopsy case, but here it's a prostatectomy, which is RP. The malignancy is confirmed, and the Gleason score is correctly formatted. No other Gleason scores are mentioned that are worse, so this is the one to report.

 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
