Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me read through the provided text carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tutkittu materiaali on prostatasta" which translates to "The material examined is from the prostate." But there's no mention of how the sample was obtained. The example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text says "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified, so I should put "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Kliinikan merkinnöissä mainitaan mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'". Even though there's uncertainty about the grade group (GG 2 or 3), the mention of Gleason sum 7 implies malignancy. However, the report also states that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed. But the presence of a Gleason score suggests malignancy was considered. However, the user instructions say to answer "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the malignancy is mentioned but there's uncertainty due to RT, but the existence of a Gleason score is noted, maybe "kyllä" is appropriate. But wait, the report says "histopatologiaa ei voida luotettavasti tehdä", so maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. Hmm. The example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when Gleason is present. Here, the Gleason sum is mentioned in clinical notes but not confirmed in the histopathology. The question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. Since the sample is difficult to assess due to RT, and the Gleason is from clinical notes, not the current sample's histopathology, maybe the malignancy is "NA". But the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (return the worst lesion results). However, the sample's own assessment is unreliable. So maybe malignancy is "NA" because the current sample's histopathology can't confirm it. But the presence of a possible Gleason sum 7 in clinical notes might suggest malignancy. This is a bit tricky. The example where Gleason is mentioned leads to "kyllä", but here the context is that the histopathology can't be reliably done. So perhaps the answer here is "kyllä" because there's a mention of Gleason sum 7, even if uncertain. Or maybe "NA" because the sample itself can't be assessed reliably. The user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the sample. If the sample's own assessment is unreliable, then maybe "NA". Let me check the example again. In the first example, the sample is a biopsy and the Gleason is directly reported, so malignancy is "kyllä". In the second example, the text is nonsensical, so all NAs. Here, the sample's histopathology is unreliable due to RT, but clinical notes mention Gleason 7. However, the question is about the sample's findings, not clinical notes. So if the sample's own analysis can't confirm malignancy due to RT effects, then malignancy would be "NA". But the user instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results). If the sample's analysis is unreliable, maybe they can't determine malignancy, hence "NA".

Third, Gleason. The text mentions "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'" but it's unclear if it's GG2 or 3, and whether the sum is confirmed. However, the example includes "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" leading to "4+3=7". Here, the sum is mentioned as 7 but the components are unclear. The user instructions require the format "major+minor=sum". Since the components (4+3 or 3+4) aren't specified, but the sum is 7, can we still report it? The example shows that even if the sum is derived from the components, it's reported. But here, the components aren't given, only the sum. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" as integers. If the components aren't specified, can we still put "7"? But the format requires "x+y=z". Since the sum is 7 but the individual grades aren't clear, maybe we can't form the required string. So in this case, the Gleason would be "NA" because the exact major and minor aren't specified. However, the clinical notes mention "Gleason summa 7", but since the sample's own assessment is unreliable, maybe it's not confirmed. So the Gleason field would be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (no mention of biopsy, RP, TURP)
Malignancy: NA (sample can't be reliably assessed, even though clinical notes mention possible Gleason)
Gleason: NA (components not specified, sample unreliable)
