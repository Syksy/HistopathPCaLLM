Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Tutkittu materiaali on prostatasta" which means the sample is from the prostate. But the allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't explicitly state the sample type. It talks about samples from apex and basiks areas, but that's about location, not the procedure type. So there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says there's a mention of 'Gleason summa 7' in the clinic notes, but it's unclear if it's confirmed. However, the presence of a Gleason score usually indicates malignancy. But the report also states that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed. So even though there's a possible Gleason 7, the reliability is in question. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says the material from apex and basiks is difficult to evaluate because of RT. The malignancy field is "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the Gleason is mentioned but uncertain, but the sample itself might not have clear malignant cells due to treatment effects. Wait, the key is "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" in the sample. The report says the histopathology can't be reliably done, so maybe they couldn't confirm malignancy. But the clinic notes mention possible Gleason 7. However, the sample's own findings are unclear. The answer might be NA because the assessment isn't reliable. But the presence of a Gleason sum in the clinic notes might suggest malignancy. Hmm. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. But if the sample can't be reliably assessed, maybe malignancy is NA. Alternatively, since Gleason is mentioned, maybe "kyllä". But the report says due to RT, histopathology isn't reliable. So the sample's own findings are inconclusive. So malignancy would be NA.

Third, Gleason. The clinic notes mention 'Gleason summa 7', but it's unclear if it's confirmed. The report states that it's unclear if it's GG 2 or 3 and whether the sum 7 was confirmed. Since the sample's own assessment isn't reliable, and the Gleason is from clinic notes but not confirmed in the current sample, the Gleason should be NA. Because the structured data should reflect the current sample's findings, not prior notes. Also, the instructions say to report the Gleason only for malignant cases, and if malignancy is NA, then Gleason is NA. But if malignancy were "kyllä", then Gleason would be required. However, in this case, since the sample's malignancy can't be confirmed, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the assessment isn't reliable. Gleason is NA because it's not confirmed in the current sample.
