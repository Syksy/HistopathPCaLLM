Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Tutkittu materiaali on prostatasta..." which translates to "The material examined is from the prostate..." but there's no mention of how the sample was taken. Terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't present. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "mahdollinen 'Gleason summa 7'" which suggests there's a possibility of malignancy. However, it's unclear if it's confirmed because the text states that due to recent radiation therapy (RT), the histopathology can't be reliably assessed. So even though there's a mention of Gleason score, the malignancy isn't confirmed here. The correct value here would be "NA" because the presence of malignancy isn't definitively stated due to the RT effects making assessment unreliable.

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". The text does mention "Gleason summa 7", but it's noted as unclear whether it's GG 2 or 3 and whether the sum was confirmed. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed and the Gleason score is uncertain, we can't reliably report it. So the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed. Gleason is NA because the sum isn't verified. The example given in the problem where uncertainty exists also results in NA values, which supports this conclusion.
