Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input statement: "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." The term "shavings" here might be a clue. I recall that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves removing tissue in shavings, especially for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. So the sample type here is likely TURP. Biopsy usually refers to needle cores, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is the removal of the entire prostate, which doesn't fit here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says "Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G". Carcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum", which is exactly what's provided here. So Gleason should be "3+3=6".

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward. No nested structures, just the three fields. The example given uses the format "4+3=7", so following that, "3+3=6" is correct.

Double-checking everything: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+3=6. All values are within the allowed parameters. The input doesn't have any conflicting information or multiple lesions, so there's no ambiguity. The output JSON should be valid with these values.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
