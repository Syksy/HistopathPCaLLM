Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I'll look at the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy". In the current statement, the text says "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." The term "shavings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is shaved off. So the Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement clearly mentions "Carcinoma was histologically detected", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum", which in this case is exactly provided. So the Gleason field should be "3+3=6".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's only one mentioned (in blocks F & G), that's straightforward. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures, so it's just a flat object with the three keys.

Double-checking everything: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+3=6. All values fit the allowed options. There's no ambiguity here. The example provided in the problem uses similar logic, so this should be correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
