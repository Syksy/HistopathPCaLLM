Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". From the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP, NA), I need to figure out which one corresponds. TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, which typically produces chips or shavings. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The report states "Karsinoomaa todettiin", meaning carcinoma was found. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text says "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum". Here, both primary and secondary patterns are 3, summing to 6. So the Gleason field should be "3+3=6".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Since the example provided uses the exact format, this case seems straightforward. All information is present, so no "NA" values are needed here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
