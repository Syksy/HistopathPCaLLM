Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "höyläyslastuja", which translates to "shavings" or "chips". In medical terms, that's typically a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Karsinoomaa todettiin", which means carcinoma was found. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, it says "Gleason 3+3=6". The required format is "major+minor=sum", so that's exactly "3+3=6".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward. All the required fields are present and fit the allowed values. No need to default to NA here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
