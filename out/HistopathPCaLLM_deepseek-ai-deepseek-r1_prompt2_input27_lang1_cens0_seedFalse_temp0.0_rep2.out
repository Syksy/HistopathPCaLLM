Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Yhteensä 13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical in a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti..." which means carcinoma was found. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text mentions "Gleason 3+3=6". So the format should be "3+3=6".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported. Here, there's only one mentioned: Gleason 3+3=6. No other lesions are noted, so that's the one to use.

No nested structures allowed, so the JSON should be flat. All values are present and fit the allowed options. No need for NA here. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because the procedure involves removing tissue chips, common in TURP. Biopsy would be needle samples, RP is the whole prostate. 

Malignancy is confirmed with "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma), so definitely malignant. Gleason is clearly stated. 

Everything seems to fit. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
