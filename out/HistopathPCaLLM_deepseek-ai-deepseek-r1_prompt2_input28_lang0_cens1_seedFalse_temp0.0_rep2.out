Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the examination mentions "six different sites of interest" and regions like "front left side", "middle left side", etc. The terms like "regions of interest" and "inspected due to elevated PSA" suggest this might be a biopsy, as biopsies are taken from multiple sites when checking for cancer. There's no mention of RP or TURP procedures, so I'll go with "biopsy" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "atypical growth patterns" and "possible pre-malignant changes". Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, so that's not a yes. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or confirmed malignancy. The regions need further inspection, but no definitive malignant findings are reported. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is "no", the Gleason field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as biopsy, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Here, since there's no malignancy, the most severe is pre-malignant, which doesn't affect the Gleason score. So the final answer should reflect that.

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
