Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä otettuna..." which translates to six biopsy cylinders taken. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) and "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue), which are malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now the tricky part: Gleason score. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. There are three pesäkkeet (lesions). Pesäke 1 has Gleason 4+4=8. Pesäke 2 is 4+3=7. Pesäke 3 is 3+4=7. The highest is 8 from pesäke 1. Even though the summary mentions "korkeimman graden maligni löydös pesäkkeessä 1 pistesummalla 8", confirming that the worst is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the highest Gleason is taken. The example given uses "major+minor=sum" format, which matches here. Also, check that all values are correctly formatted as per allowed options. Everything seems to fit. No NA needed here since all info is present.

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
