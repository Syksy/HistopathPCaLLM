Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "kuusi biopsialieriötä otettuna..." which translates to six biopsy cylinders taken. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma) and "karsinoomakudosta" (carcinoma tissue), which are malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now the tricky part: Gleason score. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. There are three pesäkkeet (lesions). Pesäke 1 has Gleason 4+4=8. Pesäke 2 is 4+3=7. Pesäke 3 is 3+4=7. The highest is 4+4=8. The summary also states "korkeimman graden maligni löydös pesäkkeessä 1 pistesummalla 8." So the correct Gleason is "4+4=8".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the highest Gleason is taken. The example given uses "major+minor=sum" format, so "4+4=8" fits. All other lesions are ignored since we take the worst one.

Check if any of the fields could be NA. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is yes, Gleason is present. So no NAs here. The JSON structure should be as per the example, with the three keys and the values as determined.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
