Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "Tutkimusmateriaali koostuu kuudesta kiinnostavasta alueesta" which translates to the examination material consisting of six areas of interest. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. The term "prostatabiopsioita" was in the example but not here. So, Sampletype is probably NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The report mentions "mahdollisesti esi-maligniteettisia muutoksia" in RoI #2, which translates to "possibly pre-malignant changes." Pre-malignant isn't malignant yet, so that's not a definite malignancy. Other areas have atypical growth patterns but no clear malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "ei" since there's no confirmed malignancy, only pre-malignant or atypical findings.

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason should be NA. The example had a clear Gleason sum, but this report doesn't mention any Gleason grades. Even though there's a mention of "grade" later, it's not in the context of Gleason scoring. So, Gleason remains NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" as there's no confirmed malignancy, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report.
