Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first part mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." It then talks about samples labeled A-F taken from different areas like left lower, right lower, etc. The terms used here don't specify the sample type. Biopsy usually refers to needle samples taken from specific regions, RP (radical prostatectomy) is the removal of the entire prostate, and TURP (transurethral resection) is a procedure to remove part of the prostate. Since the text mentions samples A-F but doesn't explicitly state the procedure type, I might have to default to NA here. The example given in the problem where the sample type wasn't clear also resulted in NA. So Sampletype is likely NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions that samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, which suggests contamination. It also states that the assessment of tumor cell differentiation stages couldn't be done for these samples. The colleague requested assessment of poor differentiation and glandular structure, but the summary says score sum determination wasn't possible and samples need re-examination. There's no explicit mention of malignant tumor findings. The absence of confirmed malignancy indicators (like adenocarcinoma detected) means Malignancy should be NA. The example where malignancy wasn't confirmed also used NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The preferred format is major+minor=sum. Since the summary states that score sum determination wasn't possible and samples need re-examination, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the report doesn't provide conclusive information on sample type, malignancy, or Gleason score. The key points are the lack of explicit procedure type, no confirmed malignancy, and inability to determine Gleason score as per the summary.
