Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." The samples are labeled A-F, taken from different regions like left lower, right lower, etc. The text refers to "samples A and C" and mentions "non-prostatic tissue," but there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the type isn't specified, I should put NA here.

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed" and mentions "potential poor differentiation" which might suggest malignancy. However, the summary states "Score sum determination was not possible," which relates to Gleason grading. There's no direct mention of a malignant tumor being found. The samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, and the assessment of tumor cells couldn't be done. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the answer here should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the preferred format is major+minor=sum. The summary clearly says "Score sum determination was not possible," so there's no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the necessary information isn't present or is inconclusive in the provided text.
