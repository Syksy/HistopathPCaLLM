Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." The samples are labeled A-F, taken from different regions like left lower, right lower, etc. The terms "samples" and "sampling procedure" suggest it's a biopsy, as RP (radical prostatectomy) and TURP (transurethral resection) are specific procedures. Since the text doesn't mention surgery like RP or TURP, but refers to sampling, I'll go with "biopsy" for Sampletype.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed" and mentions "potential poor differentiation" and "fusing glandular structure." However, there's no explicit mention of a malignant tumor being found. The summary also states that score sum determination wasn't possible, which relates to Gleason grading. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the answer here should be "no" or maybe "NA." Wait, but the user said to return "yes" only if there are malignant findings. The text doesn't confirm malignancy; it just talks about assessing potential issues. So Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? Hmm. The example given for when it's not a valid statement uses "NA" for all, but here, the statement is valid but doesn't confirm malignancy. The instructions say "malignant tumor findings" – if there's no mention of malignancy, maybe "no" is appropriate. But sometimes, if it's uncertain, maybe "NA". Let me check the example again. In the first example, adenocarcinoma is detected, so "yes". In the second example, which is invalid, all are "NA". Here, the samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue, and the assessment couldn't be done. The summary says score sum wasn't possible. So maybe there's no evidence of malignancy found in the samples they could assess. Therefore, Malignancy would be "no". But wait, the text says "differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed" which might imply that they couldn't determine if there's a tumor. So maybe "NA" is better here. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The key is whether there's any mention of malignant findings. The text doesn't say any tumor was found; it just mentions that some assessments couldn't be done. So perhaps Malignancy should be "no" because there's no positive finding, but maybe "NA" if it's uncertain. The user's instructions say "NA" if the statement isn't valid, but this is a valid statement. Wait, the second example was invalid because it was gibberish. Here, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user's instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." Since the samples A and C were non-prostatic and the others weren't mentioned as having findings, maybe there's no malignancy detected. So Malignancy: "no".

Third, Gleason. The example uses "4+3=7" when present. Here, the summary says "Score sum determination was not possible," so Gleason should be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The samples A and C were non-prostatic, but what about others? The text doesn't mention findings in B, D, E, F. So no malignancy found. Therefore, Malignancy is "no". Gleason is NA because they couldn't determine the score. Sampletype is biopsy. That seems right.
