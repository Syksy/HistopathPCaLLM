Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text starts with "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata..." which translates to "Fresh sample received prostate..." The term "tuorenäytteenä" suggests it's a fresh specimen, but I need to determine if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The mention of multiple samples taken from different lobes (A, B, C, etc.) might indicate a biopsy procedure. However, sometimes after a prostatectomy, the whole prostate is examined, and sections are taken from different areas. But the weight is about 40g, which is a typical weight for a prostate, so this might be a radical prostatectomy specimen. Wait, but biopsies are usually small samples. RP would involve the entire prostate. The text says "näytteet otettu seuraavasti" which means samples taken as follows, listing different areas. That sounds more like a biopsy where multiple cores are taken. But wait, in a prostatectomy, they might take sections from different parts. Hmm. The term "tuorenäytteenä" could mean the whole prostate was received fresh, which is typical for RP. So the sample type here is likely RP. But I need to check for keywords. The example given in the problem had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostata biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention biopsy, but the sample is the prostate itself. So the sample type is probably RP.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "invasioivaa adenokarsinoomaa" which is invasive adenocarcinoma, so malignancy is present. So "kyllä".

Gleason score. The text says "eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3". So major grade 4, minor grade 3, sum 7. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason 4+3=7. Let me double-check. The sample is the whole prostate (40g), so that's RP. The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignancy. The grades are clearly stated as 4 and 3. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
