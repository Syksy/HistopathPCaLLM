Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text starts with "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata," which translates to "Fresh sample received from the prostate." The mention of "näytteet otettu seuraavasti" (samples taken as follows) with different sections (A, B, C, etc.) suggests it's a biopsy, as they're taking multiple samples from different lobes. So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa" (invasive adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the text says "eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3." That translates to "most of grade 4 differentiation, and a smaller grade 3." The summary also states "pistesumman 7," which is the total score. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The report mentions adenocarcinoma in cassettes A and C, which are part of the left lobe, but the Gleason score given is the highest (4+3=7), so that's the one to use. All other details like tumor size or perineural invasion don't affect the Gleason score here. 

Double-checking the sample type: since it's a fresh sample with multiple sections taken from different parts, it's a biopsy. If it were RP or TURP, the description would likely mention surgical removal or resection. 

Everything seems to fit. No conflicting information. The JSON should be straightforward.
