Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material was obtained. The samples are labeled A-F, taken from different parts of the prostate. The key here is to identify the procedure type. The example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "biopsiasta". Here, the report talks about "näytteet otettiin" (samples taken) from various locations, which sounds like a biopsy procedure. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that samples A and C had tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. The main samples of interest (A and C) couldn't be properly assessed because they were contaminated. The summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" which means determining the Gleason score wasn't possible. However, the text doesn't mention any malignant findings in the other samples (B, D, E, F). Since the problematic samples (A and C) were the ones of interest but were contaminated, and there's no mention of malignancy in the other samples, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no) because no malignant cells were found in the viable samples. Wait, but maybe the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The report doesn't explicitly state that malignancy was found. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results), but if the main samples were contaminated and others didn't show malignancy, then malignancy isn't confirmed. So "ei" or "NA"? The example uses "NA" when the report is nonsensical, but here the report is valid but inconclusive. The instructions say for malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the samples that could have shown malignancy (A and C) were contaminated, and the others didn't show it, maybe the malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found in the evaluated samples. But the user might consider that since the main samples couldn't be assessed, it's "NA". Hmm. The example where Gleason couldn't be determined but malignancy was present still had "kyllä". Here, the malignancy isn't confirmed because the relevant samples were contaminated. So perhaps malignancy is "ei" if other samples (B, D, E, F) were benign, but the text doesn't mention their findings. The text only mentions A and C had non-prostatic tissue. The other samples (B, D, E, F) are not discussed in terms of findings. So maybe malignancy is "NA" because the main samples of interest (A and C) couldn't be assessed, and the others aren't reported. Wait, but the user instructions say to report the worst lesion. If the other samples (B, D, E, F) were examined but not mentioned, perhaps they didn't have malignancy. But the text doesn't say anything about their results. The key is whether malignancy was found in any sample. Since the report doesn't mention any malignancy in the other samples, and the main ones were contaminated, maybe the answer is "ei" (no malignancy found) or "NA" (couldn't assess). The example where malignancy was present but Gleason couldn't be determined still had "kyllä". In this case, since the main samples were contaminated and others aren't mentioned, perhaps the malignancy is "NA". But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" should be reported. If the main samples (A and C) were the ones of interest but couldn't be assessed, and others didn't show malignancy, then maybe malignancy is "ei". However, the absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. Since the report doesn't state any malignancy, but the main samples were contaminated, it's safer to put "NA" for malignancy. Wait, but the example given in the problem where the report was nonsensical had all fields as "NA". Here, the sample type is "biopsy", but malignancy is unclear. The user instructions say for malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't mention any malignancy findings (either positive or negative) in the viable samples, then malignancy should be "NA". But in this case, the other samples (B, D, E, F) were taken but their results aren't discussed. The text says "näytteistä indekseillä A ja C havaittiin kudosta joka ei ollut prostatasta" (samples A and C had non-prostatic tissue), but doesn't mention findings in other samples. So if the other samples were examined and found benign, but the text doesn't say, then we can't assume. Therefore, since the report doesn't state any malignancy, and the main samples were contaminated, malignancy is "NA".

For Gleason, the summary says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" (determining the score wasn't possible), so Gleason is "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "biopsy", Malignancy is "NA", Gleason is "NA".
