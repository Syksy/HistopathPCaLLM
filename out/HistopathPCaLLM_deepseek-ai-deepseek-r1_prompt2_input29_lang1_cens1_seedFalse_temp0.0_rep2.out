Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each of the required fields one by one.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" which translates to fresh prostate tissue material was obtained. The examples given in the instructions include biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report here doesn't specify the exact procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says the material was obtained, and samples were taken from different areas (A-F). Since there's no explicit mention of the procedure type, I should go with NA for the sample type.

Next, malignancy. The report states that samples A and C had tissue not from the prostate, indicating contamination. The summary mentions that determining the Gleason score wasn't possible, and samples A and C need re-examination. There's no mention of any malignant findings in the samples that were properly taken (B, D, E, F). Since the problematic samples (A and C) are contaminated and the others don't report malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the valid samples didn't show malignancy. However, I need to be careful here. The absence of mention doesn't necessarily mean absence of malignancy. Wait, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if there's no mention of malignancy in the valid samples, then malignancy would be "ei". But the report doesn't explicitly state any malignancy in the other samples. So "ei" might be correct.

Third, Gleason grade. The summary clearly says "Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista" which means determining the Gleason score wasn't possible. Since there's no malignancy reported (if we concluded "ei"), then Gleason would be NA. But if malignancy was present, then Gleason would be NA because it couldn't be determined. Wait, the malignancy field is "ei" here, so according to the rules, Gleason should be NA. So the answer here is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified, malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported in the valid samples, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be determined and there's no malignancy.
