Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The original sample is mentioned as an "autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The report says "normal benign growth," "no tumor growth," and "most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignant tumors, so Malignancy is "no."

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which makes sense here.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and not nested. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is an autopsy, which isn't in the allowed list. Yep, that's right. All set.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
