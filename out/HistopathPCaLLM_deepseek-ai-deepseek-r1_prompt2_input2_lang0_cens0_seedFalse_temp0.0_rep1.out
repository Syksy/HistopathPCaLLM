Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first sentence mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen." Prostatectomy usually refers to RP. However, later it says, "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since autopsy isn't listed, the Sampletype should be NA here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the microscopic sections show "normal benign growth," "some atrophy," "inflammation," and "hyperplasia." Importantly, it mentions "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth" and the summary says "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignancy or cancer. So Malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA. Even if there were a mention of Gleason here, since the tumor is benign, it's not applicable.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (autopsy isn't allowed), Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the exact allowed values. The example given uses "NA" for all when it's invalid, but here, even though the sample is an autopsy, which isn't allowed, the malignancy is clearly stated as no. So the answer should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
