Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The original sample is mentioned as an "autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The report says "normal benign growth," "no tumor growth," and "most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignant tumors, so Malignancy is "no."

For Gleason grade, since the malignancy is no, the Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which aligns with it being benign.

So the final JSON should have all fields as NA except Malignancy as "no."

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
