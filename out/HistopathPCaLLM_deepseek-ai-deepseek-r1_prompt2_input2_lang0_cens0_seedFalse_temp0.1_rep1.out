Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen..." So prostatectomy would indicate RP. But wait, the original sample is mentioned as an autopsy sample intended for research. Hmm, the original sample type here is autopsy, but autopsy isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since the original sample is an autopsy sample, which isn't listed, the answer here should be NA. Even though it's a prostatectomy specimen, the original sample type is autopsy, so NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "normal benign growth," "no tumor growth," and "SUMMARY: Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state... attributed to normal aging." So there's no mention of malignancy. The answer here should be "no."

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA. Even if there were some numbers mentioned, since the tumor is benign, Gleason isn't applicable.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original sample is an autopsy, which isn't one of the allowed types. Malignancy is no. Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so no Gleason. The example given for a benign case also uses NA for all fields except when malignancy is no, but here Sampletype is NA because autopsy isn't allowed. The answer should be a JSON with those values.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
