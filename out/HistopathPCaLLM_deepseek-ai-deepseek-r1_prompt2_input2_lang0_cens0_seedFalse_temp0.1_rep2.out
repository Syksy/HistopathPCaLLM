Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement: "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen..." Prostatectomy usually refers to RP (radical prostatectomy). But wait, the next line says, "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed values. The allowed options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since autopsy isn't listed, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The report mentions "normal benign growth," "no tumor growth," and "SUMMARY: Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state..." So there's no mention of malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since it's explicitly stating benign and no tumor, Malignancy should be "no."

Lastly, Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason would be NA. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. So that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (because autopsy isn't allowed), Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Check the example again to confirm formatting. Looks good.

  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
