Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is from an autopsy specimen intended for research. Autopsy isn't one of the allowed types, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions that the samples can only marginally characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. However, it's stated that further inspection is needed, and findings can't be reliably inferred due to inflammation and age-related changes. Since there's a mention of "potential" but no confirmation, the Malignancy field should be NA, not yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text here doesn't mention any specific Gleason grades like 3+4=7 or similar. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together, all three fields would be NA. The example provided for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the sample type isn't allowed and malignancy isn't confirmed.
