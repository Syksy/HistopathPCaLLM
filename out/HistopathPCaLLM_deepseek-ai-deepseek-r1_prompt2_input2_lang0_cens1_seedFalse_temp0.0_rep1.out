Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "the fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. The allowed types are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since autopsy isn't listed, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but also mentions that findings can't be reliably inferred due to inflammation and age-related changes. The key here is that there's a mention of potential malignancy, but it's not confirmed. The summary says further inspection is needed. Since it's uncertain, the malignancy isn't confirmed as yes or no. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format major+minor=sum. The text here doesn't mention any specific Gleason grades. It talks about potential adenocarcinoma but doesn't provide Gleason scores. Since there's no mention of grades, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's an autopsy, Malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA because no grades are reported. The answer should be a JSON with all three fields as NA.
