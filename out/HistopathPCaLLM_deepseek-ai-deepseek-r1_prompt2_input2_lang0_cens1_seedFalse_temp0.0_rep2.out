Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is from an "autopsy specimen intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's stated that further inspection is needed and current findings are unreliable due to inflammation and age-related changes. Since it's uncertain, Malignancy should be NA, not yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The text doesn't mention any specific Gleason scores or grades. There's a reference to adenocarcinoma but no numerical grades provided. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields should be NA because the sample is from an autopsy (not allowed type), malignancy is uncertain, and no Gleason details are present.
