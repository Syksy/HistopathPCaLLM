Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions the sample is from an "autopsy specimen." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says there's a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it's stated that further inspection is needed and current findings can't be reliably inferred. Since it's uncertain, Malignancy would be NA because there's no definitive confirmation of malignancy.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows it should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together, all three fields would be NA. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the sample isn't a biopsy, RP, or TURP, and malignancy isn't confirmed.
