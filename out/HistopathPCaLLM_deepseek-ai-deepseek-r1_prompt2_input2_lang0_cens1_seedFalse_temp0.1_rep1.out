Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text, it mentions "the fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. The allowed types are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since autopsy isn't listed, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but also states that findings can't be reliably inferred due to inflammation and age-related changes. The key here is that it's uncertain. The summary mentions "potential" malignancy, but it's not confirmed. So since there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, Malignancy should be NA, not yes or no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here, there's no reported Gleason grade. The text doesn't mention any specific grades like 3+4 or similar. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's an autopsy, Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy or grades mentioned. The example given for an invalid statement also uses NA for all fields when the text isn't a valid histopathological report, which seems similar here since the findings are inconclusive.
