Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options. The allowed types are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since autopsy isn't listed, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes," but it says "Further inspection and sample re-runs are required" and that findings can't be reliably inferred due to inflammation and age-related changes. So there's a suspicion but no confirmation. Since it's not confirmed, Malignancy should be NA, not yes or no.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" format. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason grades. It talks about adenocarcinoma potentially, but without a confirmed malignancy, there's no Gleason reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy NA, Gleason NA. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the sample is from an autopsy (not allowed type), malignancy is uncertain, and no Gleason is mentioned.
