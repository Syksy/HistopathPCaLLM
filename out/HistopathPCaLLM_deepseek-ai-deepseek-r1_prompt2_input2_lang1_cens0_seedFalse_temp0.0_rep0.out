Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radikaali prostatektomia), TURP, or NA. The report starts with "Näytteenä on radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to "The sample is a radical prostatectomy specimen." So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti kaikissa makroleikkeissä... lähinnä normaalia kasvustoa" (microscopically, mainly normal growth in all macro sections). There's mention of atrophy, some inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no mention of cancer or malignancy. The summary says "korkeintaan lievä-asteista tulehdusta ja tyypillisiä ikäpohjaisia muutoksia" (at most mild inflammation and typical age-related changes). So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the absence of malignancy.

I need to make sure there's no mention of any malignant findings. Words like adenokarsinooma or kasvain (tumor) would indicate malignancy, but here they're talking about normal growth and non-cancerous changes. Also, the resection margins are clean ("resektio pinnat puhtaat") and no tumor tissue in seminal vesicles ("seminaaleissa ei kasvainkudosta"). 

So the final JSON should be:
Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
