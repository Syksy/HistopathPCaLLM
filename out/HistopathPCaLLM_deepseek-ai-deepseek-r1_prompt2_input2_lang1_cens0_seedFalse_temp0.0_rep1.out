Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text starts with "Näytteenä on radikaali prostatektomianäyte..." which translates to "The sample is a radical prostatectomy sample..." So "radikaali prostatektomia" is radical prostatectomy, which corresponds to "RP". So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti kaikissa makroleikkeissä... lähinnä normaalia kasvustoa." So microscopically, mainly normal growth. There's mention of atrophy, some inflammation, and hyperplasia, but no mention of malignancy like adenokarsinooma or cancer terms. The summary says "korkeintaan lievä-asteista tulehdusta ja tyypillisiä ikäpohjaisia muutoksia" which is mild inflammation and typical age-related changes. So no malignancy. Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Let me double-check. The sample type is definitely RP. No signs of malignancy, so Gleason isn't applicable. The JSON should reflect that. I think that's all. No conflicting info in the text.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
