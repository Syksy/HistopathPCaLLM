Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radikaali prostatektomia), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report says there's "normaalia kasvustoa" (normal growth), some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia. It explicitly states "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) in the seminal vesicles. Since there's no mention of malignancy like adenokarsinooma or other cancers, Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades (like 3, 4, 5) or a sum. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings. The example provided also shows that if there's no malignancy, all fields related to it are NA. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
