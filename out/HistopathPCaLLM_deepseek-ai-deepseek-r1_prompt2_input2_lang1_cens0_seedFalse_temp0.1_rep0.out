Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "normaalia kasvustoa" (normal growth), "atrofiaa" (atrophy), some inflammation, and hyperplasia. Importantly, it states "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) in the seminal vesicles. Since there's no mention of malignancy like adenokarsinooma (adenocarcinoma), the answer here is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". The example given shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason in a non-malignant case, the instructions say to use NA for benign findings. 

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. The summary at the end also mentions only mild inflammation and age-related changes, no cancer. So all three fields are clear.
