Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radikaali prostatektomia), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Näytteenä on radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to "The sample is a radical prostatectomy specimen." So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti kaikissa makroleikkeissä... lähinnä normaalia kasvustoa" (microscopically, mainly normal growth in all macro sections). It also states "ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue) in the seminal vesicles. Since there's no mention of malignancy, just inflammation and age-related changes, Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA". The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so that's confirmed.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, there's no malignancy, so all fields are straightforward. The answer should be a JSON with these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
