Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "radikaali prostatektomianäyte," which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says there's "normaalia kasvustoa" (normal growth), some atrophy and inflammation, and hyperplasia. It also states "seminaaleissa ei kasvainkudosta" (no tumor tissue in the seminal vesicles) and the summary mentions no signs of malignancy. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3+4 or similar, which further confirms that.

I need to make sure there's no mention of any cancerous findings. The key points here are the absence of tumor tissue and the presence of benign changes. So the JSON should reflect that with "ei" for malignancy and NA for Gleason.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
