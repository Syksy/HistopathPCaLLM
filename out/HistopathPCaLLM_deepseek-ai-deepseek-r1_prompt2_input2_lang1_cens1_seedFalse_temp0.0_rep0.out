Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the three required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current report, the text starts with "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." Translating that, "tuorenäyte" means fresh sample, and "ruumiinavaus" is an autopsy. The sample is from an autopsy, but none of the allowed sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP) match an autopsy sample. So the sample type should be "NA".

Second, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa" which translates to "possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes needing evaluation". However, the conclusion states that further tests are needed because the current samples are limited. There's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy here. The presence is only suspected but not confirmed. So malignancy should be "NA" because it's not confirmed.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason score should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, just possible adenocarcinoma. So no numbers here.

Putting it all together: sample type is NA because it's an autopsy sample not fitting the allowed types, malignancy is NA because it's not confirmed, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
