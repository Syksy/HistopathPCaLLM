Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason score. The input is a Finnish medical text, which might be a bit challenging, but I'll do my best.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided example, "biopsy" was derived from "Prostata biopsiasta". The current input mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian". I remember that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so "radikaaliprostatetomian" likely refers to an RP sample. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "adenokarsinoomaksi", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The input has "grade 4+3=7". Even though it's part of a longer sentence, the key numbers are 4 and 3 summing to 7. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The text doesn't mention multiple lesions, so this is straightforward. All three fields are present and valid. No "NA" needed here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
