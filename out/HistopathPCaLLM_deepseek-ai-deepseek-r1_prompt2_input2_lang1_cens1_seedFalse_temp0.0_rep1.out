Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided example, the sample type was "biopsy" because the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the test case, the text is in Finnish, so I need to look for keywords like "biopsia", "leikkaus", "RP", or "TURP". 

Next, check for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. The presence of terms like "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) or "maligni" would indicate malignancy. If the report mentions cancer or malignant cells, then "kyllä". If it's benign or no malignancy found, "ei". If unclear, then NA.

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The example had "4+3=7". So I need to look for numbers in that pattern. If malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is NA. If malignancy is "kyllä", extract the highest Gleason mentioned. If there are multiple, take the worst one. If no Gleason is mentioned, then NA.

Now, looking at the test input: "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus (RP) näyte. Löydöksissä on adenokarsinoomaa, Gleason 4 + 5 = 9, ja lisäksi hieman Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 aluetta. Kasvain on ulottunut myös kapselin läpi."

Sampletype: The text starts with "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus (RP) näyte." So RP is the sample type. That's clear.

Malignancy: "adenokarsinoomaa" is a malignant tumor, so "kyllä".

Gleason: There are two scores mentioned: 4+5=9 and 3+3=6. The instruction says to take the worst (pahimman) lesion. The higher sum is 9 (4+5), so that's the major one. The format should be "4+5=9".

So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is reported. The example in the problem shows that even if there are multiple, only the highest is taken. The test case here has two, so we pick 4+5=9.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
