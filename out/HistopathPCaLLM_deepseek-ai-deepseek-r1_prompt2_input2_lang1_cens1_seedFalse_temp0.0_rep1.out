Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input is a bit of a free-text summary, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The original text mentions "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." Ruumiinavaus means autopsy. But the allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Autopsy isn't one of the options, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The summary says that current samples are limited for evaluating possible adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. It mentions "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa" which suggests suspicion but no confirmation. Since there's no definitive mention of malignancy found, the answer here is "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report doesn't confirm malignancy; it's uncertain. But the question is whether malignant findings were present. Since it's not confirmed and they need more tests, maybe the answer is "ei" because they didn't find any definite malignancy. Or is it NA because it's inconclusive? The example given in the problem had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, it's possible but not confirmed. The instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" should be reported, but if there's no confirmed malignancy, then Malignancy is "ei" or NA? The example where malignancy wasn't clear used "NA". Wait, in the second example, the text was nonsensical, so all fields were NA. Here, the report is meaningful but inconclusive. The user instruction says for Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample doesn't have malignant findings (since it's only possible but not confirmed), then maybe "ei". But the summary says "nykyiset näytteet ovat vain rajallisesti käytettävissä mahdollisen adenokarsinooman... arvioinnisa", which implies they can't assess properly. So maybe Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. But the allowed options are only kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the sample didn't show malignancy, but there's a need for more tests, perhaps the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was found in the current sample. Or is it NA because the assessment couldn't be made? Hmm. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy, so "kyllä". Here, the report says they can't evaluate properly due to limited samples, but mentions possible malignancy. However, since no malignancy was actually found in the sample (only possible), maybe the answer is "ei". But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the instructions again. The second field is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä". If the sample didn't find any, but there's a suspicion requiring more tests, then the answer is "ei" because the current sample doesn't have malignant findings. So Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason. Since Malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no confirmed adenocarcinoma. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since it's from autopsy, not biopsy, RP, or TURP). Malignancy is "ei" (no malignancy found in the sample). Gleason is "NA".
