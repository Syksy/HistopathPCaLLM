Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first part says "Prostatan radikaalileikkauksessa (RP)..." which translates to "In radical prostatectomy (RP)...". So the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, check for malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma), which is a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä".

Then, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The text states "Gleason 4+3=7". So that's exactly the format needed. Even though there's a mention of "lisäksi on pientä määrää Gleason 3+3=6 adenokarsinoomaa", the instructions say to take only the worst lesion. The highest sum here is 4+3=7, so that's the one to report.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. The JSON should be flat. All values seem to fit the allowed options. No issues here. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as "RP", Malignancy as "kyllä", and Gleason as "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
