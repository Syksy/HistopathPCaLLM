Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Tuorenäyte on saatu tutkimuskäyttöön luovutetusta ruumiinavauksesta." Ruumiinavaus means autopsy. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Since it's from an autopsy, none of the allowed sample types fit. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The summary says "nykyiset näytteet ovat vain rajallisesti käytettävissä mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa..." So there's a mention of possible malignancy (adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes), but it's not confirmed. The report states that further tests are needed. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it's not confirmed, but there's suspicion, but the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The text says the current samples are limited for assessing possible malignancy. The actual findings mentioned are inflammation and age-related changes, no clear malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample doesn't have confirmed malignancy, but possible, but not confirmed, then the answer is "ei" because they didn't find any, just possible but not confirmed. Or is it NA? The example given in the problem had "NA" when it was unclear. Wait, in the example where the text was not a meaningful report, all were NA. Here, the report says that they can't conclude due to inflammation and age-related changes, and more tests are needed. So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). Since the answer is that they couldn't confirm, and the current samples are limited, the answer would be "ei" because no malignancy was found, but they can't rule it out. Wait, but the summary says "mahdollisen adenokarsinooman tai muiden malignien muutosten arvioinnisa" which implies that they couldn't assess properly. So maybe the answer is "ei" because the sample didn't show malignancy, but the report is inconclusive. The key is whether malignant findings were present. If the sample doesn't show any, even if it's inconclusive, then "ei". But if the sample is inadequate, maybe NA. Hmm. The example given in the problem where the report was nonsensical had all NAs. Here, the report is meaningful but inconclusive. The malignancy field is "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since the sample didn't show malignancy, but there's a need for more tests, but the current findings don't indicate malignancy, then "ei". Because the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. The answer is no, but they can't exclude it due to limited sample. So Malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because they couldn't confirm adenocarcinoma. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since autopsy isn't one of the allowed types), Malignancy is "ei" (no malignant findings in the sample), and Gleason is NA.
