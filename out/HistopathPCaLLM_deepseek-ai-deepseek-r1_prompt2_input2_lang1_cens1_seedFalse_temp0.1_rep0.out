Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. The example given was a biopsy, so I should look for keywords like "biopsia" or "biopsy" in the text. The input text here is in Finnish. Let me check the provided sample text: "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus. Adenokarsinoomaa, Gleason 4+3=7 (Grouppe 2), ISUP 3. Kasvain on ulottunut molempiin lapioseihin (pT3b). Marginaalit negatiiviset. R- ja L-kudosnäytteet." The first line says "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus," which translates to "radical prostatectomy of the prostate." So the sample type here is RP. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Adenokarsinoomaa," which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy should be "kyllä."

Third, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The text says "Gleason 4+3=7." So that's exactly what we need. The example also used this format. Even though there's additional info like ISUP 3, the Gleason part is clear here. So the Gleason field is "4+3=7."

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's the one to use. The sample type is RP because it's a radical prostatectomy. The malignancy is confirmed by the presence of adenocarcinoma. All fields are present and correctly identifiable. No ambiguities here. The answer should be straightforward JSON with these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
