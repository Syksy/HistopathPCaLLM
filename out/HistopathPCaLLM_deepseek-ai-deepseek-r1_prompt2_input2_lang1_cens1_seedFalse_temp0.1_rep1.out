Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the provided text: "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus (RP) preparaatti..." The abbreviation RP is mentioned, which stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "adenokarsinoomaa", which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is present. The answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 4+3=7". Even though it's written as "Gleason 4+3=7", the correct format is to have the major and minor grades added. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. In this case, there's only one Gleason score mentioned, so that's straightforward. All required information is present and correctly formatted. No need to default to "NA" here.

  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
