Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Prostatan radikaalileikkaus (RP) preparaatti. Kasvain on adenokarsinooma, Gleason 4 + 4 = 8, ISUP 4. Kasvain on läpäissyt kapselin ja tunkeutua seminalvesikkeliin. Lisäksi on sentromaista metastasia." The first part mentions "radikaalileikkaus (RP)", which translates to radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Kasvain on adenokarsinooma", which is a type of malignant tumor. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason score, the text clearly says "Gleason 4 + 4 = 8". The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+4=8".

I need to ensure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. Here, the Gleason is explicitly given, so that's straightforward. No other lesions mentioned seem worse. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as kyllä, and Gleason as 4+4=8. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no ambiguity. The sample type is RP, malignancy is confirmed with adenocarcinoma, and Gleason score is clearly stated. All looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
