Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the samples are mentioned as "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is chipped away. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text states the most common pattern is grade 4, secondary is grade 3, and tertiary grade 5. However, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. Tertiary is a lesser component, so the primary and secondary are 4 and 3. The sum is 7, so Gleason should be "4+3=7." Even though there's a prior mention of 3+3, the updated diagnosis is 4+3=7, which is the most severe now.

Wait, the example includes tertiary but the user says to take the most severe lesion. But Gleason scoring typically uses the two highest grades, not including tertiary. However, the user's example includes the sum of the two main grades. The text here says "diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." So primary is 4, secondary 3, sum 7. The tertiary 5 isn't part of the main score. So the Gleason should be 4+3=7. The prior 3+3 is outdated, so the current is 4+3=7. 

So the structured data should be:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+3=7
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
