Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" is a bit unclear, but TURP often involves removing tissue chips, so maybe TURP is the sample type here. I don't see mentions of biopsy or RP directly, so TURP seems plausible. If not, then maybe NA, but I think TURP fits.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor. So the answer here should be "yes."

For the Gleason grade, the example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text says "diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." However, the user instructions specify to take the most severe lesion. Tertiary grade 5 might be considered, but typically Gleason scoring is based on the primary and secondary patterns. The prior diagnosis was 3+3, but after revision, it's updated. The key part is "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1)." Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7. Even though there's a tertiary grade 5, the main Gleason score would be 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7."

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. The tertiary grade 5 might be a higher grade, but the primary and secondary are 4 and 3. However, sometimes tertiary patterns are noted, but the main sum is still primary + secondary. The example given in the problem uses the primary and secondary even if there's a tertiary, so I'll follow that.
