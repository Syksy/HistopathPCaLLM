Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the given text, the samples are mentioned as "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is chipped away. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes."

Now, Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum." The text states the primary pattern is grade 4, secondary is 3, and tertiary is 5. However, the user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. Tertiary patterns are usually not included in the main score unless specified. But the example includes the sum, so maybe the main is 4+3=7. However, there's a mention of updating the diagnosis from 3+3 to Grade Group 3 (which corresponds to 4+3=7). So the Gleason here should be "4+3=7."

Wait, the text also mentions "tertiary pattern grade 5." But according to guidelines, the primary and secondary are the two most common patterns. Tertiary is only considered if it's higher. But the structured data should take the most severe lesion. If the tertiary is higher, does that affect the sum? For example, if it's 4 + 3 with tertiary 5, the Gleason score is still 7, but sometimes noted as 4+3+5. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7" even with tertiary. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. But the example given in the problem includes a tertiary but the answer only uses the major and minor. So maybe we should follow that. The text says the prior was 3+3, now updated to 4+3=7 (Grade Group 3). So the Gleason is "4+3=7."

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: yes
Gleason: 4+3=7

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
