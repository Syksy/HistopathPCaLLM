Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the text mentions "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" and talks about consultations and uncertain findings. There's no mention of any specific sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that "atypical findings were suspected" but the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions." The earlier diagnosis was uncertain and requires further examination. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and it's stated that they couldn't confirm or deny, it's not a clear yes or no. So Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason should be NA.

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions or tumors. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the text is about uncertain findings without confirmation. Therefore, the structured JSON should have all fields as NA.
