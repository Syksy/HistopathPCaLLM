Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample is from "lastuista" which translates to "chips" or "specimens" obtained near the ureter. The mention of "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista" suggests it's a biopsy, as TURP samples are also chips but the context here might be biopsy. However, sometimes TURP is a procedure for removing tissue, so I need to be careful. But since the text doesn't explicitly mention TURP or RP, and it's about taking samples (lastuista), maybe biopsy is correct. Wait, but TURP also produces chips. Hmm. The example given in the instructions for biopsy uses "prostata biopsiasta" which is similar to "lastuista" here. But TURP is also a type of biopsy? Or is it a different sample type. The user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. If the text doesn't specify, maybe it's NA. Wait, the example where the sample type is biopsy uses "biopsiasta" in the text. Here, the text says "lastuista" which are chips, which could be from TURP. But the example in the user's instructions for TURP would probably have "TURP" mentioned. Since the text here doesn't mention TURP or RP, but refers to "lastuista" (chips), which can be from TURP. But without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to put NA. Wait, but the user's example for biopsy uses "biopsiasta" and the sample type is biopsy. Here, "lastuista" could be from biopsy or TURP. Since the sample type isn't explicitly stated, maybe NA is better. But I'm not sure. Let me check again. The text says "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista" which translates to "specimens taken near the ureter cells". If it's a biopsy, then sampletype is biopsy. If it's TURP, then TURP. But without the procedure name, maybe it's unclear. However, in some contexts, "lastu" can refer to TURP specimens. But the user's example uses "biopsiasta" for biopsy. Since the text here doesn't mention the procedure, perhaps the sampletype is NA. But maybe in the context, "lastuista" implies biopsy. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. In the example given by the user, the sample type is biopsy because the text says "biopsiasta". Here, the text doesn't mention the procedure, just "lastuista". So maybe the sampletype is NA. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe "lastu" in Finnish pathology reports often refers to TURP. But I'm not certain. Let's tentatively put NA here unless there's a clear indication.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The text says "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So the primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and tertiary 5. But according to Gleason grading, the tertiary pattern is only considered in certain cases. However, the user's instruction says to report the major and minor, sum. The example given in the user's example uses 4+3=7. Here, the main is 4, secondary 3, and tertiary 5. But the user's instruction says to take the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So perhaps the highest grades are considered. Wait, but the instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset" which I think means the worst lesion's Gleason score. In current practice, when there's a tertiary pattern, the Gleason score is the sum of the primary and the highest remaining pattern. So if it's 4 + 3 with tertiary 5, the score would be 4 +5=9. But the text here says "luokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". So primary 4, secondary 3, tertiary 5. However, the user's example uses the major and minor, sum. The instruction says to report "major+minor=sum" as integers. So perhaps in this case, the tertiary is ignored, and it's 4+3=7. But the text also mentions that the previous diagnosis was 3+3, now updated to 4+3=7 (since Grade Group 3 corresponds to 4+3=7). The text says "nyt siis Grade Group 3, aiempi GG 1". Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. So the correct Gleason here is 4+3=7. The tertiary 5 might be noted but not included in the sum. So the answer should be "4+3=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The text doesn't explicitly state biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "lastuista" could be from a biopsy or TURP. Since the example uses "biopsiasta" for biopsy, and here it's "lastuista" without procedure name, maybe it's safer to put NA. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if "lastu" in this context is from TURP, then TURP. But without explicit mention, perhaps NA. Wait, the user's allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. If the sample is from TURP, it's TURP. If from biopsy, biopsy. But how to determine. The text says "lastuista" which are chips, which are typically from TURP. But in the example, "biopsiasta" is biopsy. So maybe in this case, since it's "lastuista" and not explicitly TURP, but the sample type isn't mentioned, perhaps NA. Alternatively, maybe "lastu" implies TURP. For example, TURP specimens are often called chips. So maybe sampletype is TURP. But I'm not certain. Let me check the example again. The example where sampletype is biopsy has "biopsiasta" in the text. The other example where it's NA has no clear sample type. Here, "lastuista" could be TURP. So maybe sampletype is TURP. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the user's examples don't have TURP, maybe the answer is NA. Hmm. The user's allowed values include TURP, so if the text refers to TURP, it should be TURP. But how to know. The Finnish term for TURP is "transuretraalinen prostatan resektio" or "TURP". Since the text doesn't mention TURP, maybe it's safer to put NA. Alternatively, "lastu" might be from biopsy. But in some contexts, biopsy cores are called "näytteet" and TURP specimens "lastut". So perhaps in this case, "lastuista" refers to TURP. Therefore, sampletype would be TURP. But I'm not entirely sure. The user's instructions say to extract based on the text. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure, maybe it's NA. But the example shows that "biopsiasta" leads to biopsy. Here, "lastuista" might be TURP. Let's check another angle. The text mentions "MM & MM varmistavat että ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista..." which translates to "MM & MM confirm that from the chips taken near the ureter cells...". TURP is a procedure where chips are removed from the prostate. So if the sample is from TURP, then sampletype is TURP. But if it's a biopsy, then biopsy. Since the text doesn't specify, but the sample is "lastuista", which are chips, it's more likely TURP. So sampletype would be TURP. But I'm not 100% certain. However, given that the example uses "biopsiasta" for biopsy, and here it's "lastuista" (chips), which is typical for TURP, I'll go with TURP.

So:

Sampletype: TURP

Malignancy: kyllä (due to adenocarcinoma)

Gleason: 4+3=7 (as per the updated diagnosis to Grade Group 3, which is 4+3=7)
