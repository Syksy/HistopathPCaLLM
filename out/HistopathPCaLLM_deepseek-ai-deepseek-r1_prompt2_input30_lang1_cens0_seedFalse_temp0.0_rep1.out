Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given example and the instructions again to make sure I understand correctly.

First, the sample type can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". So I need to look for keywords indicating the sample type. The current report mentions "lastuista" which I think means cores or samples, but the sample type isn't directly stated. Wait, the text says "saaduista lastuista" which refers to the samples taken. But the original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned here. The example where it was NA had a confusing text without clear sample type. In this case, maybe the sample type is biopsy because "lastuista" might be from a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The text is a consultation, and they mention "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista" which translates to "samples taken near the urothelial cells". Since biopsies are often taken as samples, maybe "biopsy" is the correct sample type here. But I need to confirm if there's a specific term like TURP or RP mentioned. The text doesn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so maybe it's a biopsy. So Sampletype would be "biopsy".

Next, Malignancy. The example had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was found. Here, the text mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, they mention updating the diagnosis to Grade Group 3, which is a malignancy. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Gleason score. The example used "4+3=7". The current text says "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". Wait, the primary pattern is 4, secondary is 3, and there's a tertiary 5. But according to Gleason grading, if there's a tertiary pattern, the score is the primary plus the highest of the remaining. So if it's 4 + 3 with a tertiary 5, the Gleason score would be 4 + 5 = 9. But the text says "Grade Group 3". Grade Group 3 corresponds to Gleason 4+5=9 or 5+4=9? Wait, no. Grade Groups are different. Let me recall: Grade Group 1 is Gleason 3+3=6, Group 2 is 3+4=7, Group 3 is 4+3=7, Group 4 is 8, and Group 5 is 9-10. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me check: 

Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤6
Grade Group 2: 3+4=7
Grade Group 3: 4+3=7
Grade Group 4: 8
Grade Group 5: 9-10

But in the text, they mention "Grade Group 3, aiempi GG 1". The previous was 3+3=6 (GG1), now updated to GG3. So the current Gleason must be 4+3=7, which is GG3. But the text mentions "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". Tertiary grade 5. However, according to current grading rules, if there's a tertiary pattern, the Gleason score is the primary plus the highest of the secondary or tertiary. So if primary is 4, secondary 3, tertiary 5, then the score would be 4 +5=9. But the Grade Group here is 3, which corresponds to 4+3=7. This is conflicting. Maybe the tertiary is not considered in the sum here? Or perhaps the report is using the rule where tertiary is only considered if it's higher than the secondary. Wait, the user instructions say to report the worst lesion's result, and the Gleason in "major+minor=sum" format. So if the main components are 4 and 3, sum 7, but there's a tertiary 5, but the sum is still 4+3=7. However, in some cases, tertiary patterns are noted but the main sum is still the primary and secondary. But according to the latest guidelines, tertiary patterns of higher grade are included. For example, if there's a 4+3=7 with tertiary 5, the Gleason score is still 4+3=7, but the presence of tertiary 5 is noted. However, the Grade Group would still be based on the primary and secondary. But Grade Group 3 is 4+3=7. However, if there's a tertiary 5, some systems might upgrade the Grade Group. But the text here says the Grade Group is 3, so the sum must be 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason should be "4+3=7". The tertiary 5 might be mentioned but not included in the sum for the main reporting. So the answer would be "4+3=7".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy yes, Gleason 4+3=7.
