Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given example and the instructions again to make sure I understand correctly.

First, the sample type can be "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". So I need to look for keywords indicating the sample type. The current report mentions "lastuista" which I think means cores or samples, but the sample type isn't directly stated. Wait, the text says "saaduista lastuista" which refers to the samples taken. But the original sample type isn't explicitly mentioned here. The example where it was NA had a confusing text without clear sample type. In this case, maybe the sample type is biopsy because "lastuista" might be from a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The text is a consultation, and mentions "ureteelisolujen läheltä saaduista lastuista" which translates to "samples taken near the urothelial cells". Since it's about prostate cancer, and the samples are "lastuista", which are cores, that's typically from a biopsy. So Sampletype would be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. Also, they updated the diagnosis from GG1 (3+3) to GG3 (4+3=7 with tertiary 5). So malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason, the report states "erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5". The primary is 4, secondary 3, and tertiary 5. But according to Gleason grading, the tertiary pattern is only considered in certain cases. However, the user instructions say to report the major and minor, sum as "major+minor=sum". The example had 4+3=7. Here, the main grades are 4 and 3, sum 7. The tertiary 5 might not be included in the sum, but the instruction says to take the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7". The tertiary 5 might be noted elsewhere but according to the example, we just take the major and minor. So the answer is "4+3=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's from lastuista, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: kyllä (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 4+3=7 (major 4, minor 3, sum 7)

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
