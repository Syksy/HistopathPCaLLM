Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information: sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason score. The input text is in Finnish, so I need to make sure I understand the key terms.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided example, the sample type was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the text says "Kudosnäytteen tulkinta..." which translates to "tissue sample interpretation". But there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the answer should be NA for sample type.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions that there were initial suspicions of abnormal findings ("epäilty poikkeavia löydöksiä"), but the consultants couldn't confirm or dismiss them. The patient's previous diagnosis was uncertain, and further tests are needed. Since the malignancy isn't confirmed here, the answer should be NA. Even though there were suspicions, it's not confirmed as malignant or benign.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. However, since malignancy isn't confirmed (it's NA), the Gleason score should also be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which supports this conclusion.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it and malignancy isn't confirmed.
