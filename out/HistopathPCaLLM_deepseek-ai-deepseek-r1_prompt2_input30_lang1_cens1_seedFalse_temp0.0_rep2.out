Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "kudosnäytteen" which translates to "tissue sample" in Finnish. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample type isn't clearly stated, so I should mark this as "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that there were uncertain findings ("epävarmojen löydösten vuoksi") and that the original suspicions couldn't be confirmed or dismissed ("eivät pystyneet varmistamaan tai hylkäämään epäilyjä"). Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, but also no clear indication that it's benign, the malignancy status isn't determined. So, "NA" here as well.

For Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason score isn't applicable. Hence, "NA".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided shows that if the report is unclear, all fields become "NA". In this case, the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and no Gleason is mentioned. Therefore, all three fields should be "NA".
