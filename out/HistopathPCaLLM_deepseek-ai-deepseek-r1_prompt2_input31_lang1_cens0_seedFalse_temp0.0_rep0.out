Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the provided text step by step.

First, the sample type. The text mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, there are references to "targetoitua biopsiaa" (targeted biopsy) and "biopsiapalassa" (biopsy piece). So the sample type should be "biopsy". The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's clearly a biopsy, that's settled.

Next, malignancy. The report talks about "minimaalinen fokus 3+3=6 Gleason löydöstä" which is a Gleason score, indicating cancer. Then later, there's another finding with "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". Gleason grades 4 and 5 are malignant. So the malignancy is definitely "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. The initial mention is 3+3=6, but later there's a more severe finding. The text states that the new finding has primary pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, making it 4+5=9. However, the user needs to check if that's the case. Wait, the text says "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (mainly growth pattern 4) and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common growth pattern 5). So the primary is 4, secondary is 5, sum 9. But the user should confirm if the highest is indeed 4+5=9. The report also mentions that the previous Gleason 6 wasn't the worst, and the new finding updates the treatment plan. So the worst here is 4+5=9. Therefore, Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but in the example given, the format is "major+minor=sum". So primary (major) and secondary (minor) added. So if primary is 4 and secondary is 5, it's 4+5=9. But sometimes, the higher grade is taken as the primary even if it's less in quantity. Wait, no, the primary is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary is the next most prevalent. So in this case, the main pattern is 4, secondary is 5. So the correct Gleason score is 4+5=9. Therefore, the answer should be "4+5=9".

But let me double-check the text. The relevant part: "toisesta löytyykin melkein 10mm matkalta laaja fokus, jossa pääosin kasvutapaa 4. ... Vaikuttaa vahvasti kuitenkin että toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5." So primary is 4, secondary is 5. So sum is 4+5=9. Yes. So that's the correct Gleason score to report.
