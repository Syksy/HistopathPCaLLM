Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a JSON structure. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text, the patient underwent a "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies were done. So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. The example given in the problem also uses "biopsy" for similar terms, so that's clear.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "minimaalinen fokus 3+3=6 Gleason löydöstä" which is a Gleason score, indicating malignancy. Later, there's another biopsy with "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". Gleason 4 and 5 are definitely malignant. So malignancy is present, so "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum". The problem states to report the worst lesion. The initial biopsy had 3+3=6, but the later targeted biopsy found 4 and 5. The text says "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". Wait, "toiseksi yleisin" means the second most common. So the primary (major) is 4, and the secondary (minor) is 5. So the sum would be 4+5=9. The report also mentions that the previous Gleason 6 wasn't the worst, and the new finding has grade 4 and 5. So the worst Gleason here is 4+5=9. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is reported. The example given in the problem uses the highest found in the report, so even if there are multiple, we take the highest. Here, 4+5=9 is the highest mentioned, so that's correct.

Double-checking the sample type: mentions biopsies multiple times, no RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so "biopsy" is correct. Malignancy is confirmed with the presence of Gleason scores. Gleason is the highest sum found, which is 4+5=9. So the JSON should have those values.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
