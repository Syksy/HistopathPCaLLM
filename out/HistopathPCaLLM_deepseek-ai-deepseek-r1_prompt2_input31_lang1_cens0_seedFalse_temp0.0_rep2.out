Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse the given medical report in Finnish and extract three specific pieces of information into a JSON structure. The fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The report mentions "systeemibiopsiossa" which translates to systematic biopsy. Then later, there's "tehty pari targetoitua biopsiaa" meaning two targeted biopsies were done. So the sample type here is definitely biopsy. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" for a similar case, so that's settled.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text mentions "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" which means malignant findings. The first biopsy had a minimal focus of 3+3=6 Gleason, which is considered malignant. Then in the second biopsy, there's a larger focus with growth patterns 4 and 5. Both of these are malignant. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The first biopsy was 3+3=6, but the second biopsy has growth pattern 4 and the second most common is 5. Wait, the text says "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" which means mainly pattern 4, and "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" so secondary pattern 5. Therefore, the Gleason score would be 4+5=9. But wait, the example in the problem uses the sum as major + minor. Wait, Gleason scoring is the sum of the primary (most prevalent) and secondary (second most prevalent) patterns. So if primary is 4 and secondary is 5, then it's 4+5=9. However, the text says "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" which is the secondary pattern. So the major is 4, minor is 5, sum 9. But the user's example shows "4+3=7" as the format. So the correct format here would be "4+5=9".

But wait, the report also mentions that the previous Gleason sum was 6, but the new finding shows that the worst was missed. The current worst is 4+5=9. So the answer should reflect the highest Gleason from the worst lesion, which is now 4+5=9.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since the samples are biopsies)
Malignancy: kyllä (there are malignant findings)
Gleason: "4+5=9"

I need to check if there's any ambiguity. The text says "morfologiset solumuutokset vaikeuttavat tulkintaa" which means morphological changes make interpretation difficult, but it still states that the secondary pattern is 5. So despite difficulties, they conclude it's 4+5=9. So that's the correct Gleason to report.
