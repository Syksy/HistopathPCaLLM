Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a histopathological report from prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "näytteet" (samples) taken after imaging. The first sample had a technical failure, and others were taken. The key term here is "näytteet", which is plural for samples. However, the report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since there's no explicit mention of the sample type, I should mark this as "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report mentions "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" (suspicious findings) in the samples, covering about 5%. However, it's stated that the interpretation is difficult and requires more samples. The term "epäilyttäviä" suggests suspicion but not confirmation of malignancy. Since there's no clear mention of malignancy (like adenocarsinooma or pahanlaatuinen), the answer here should be "NA" because it's uncertain.

Lastly, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy isn't confirmed and the findings are only suspicious without a specific Gleason grade mentioned, there's no Gleason score reported. So this field is "NA".

Putting it all together, all three fields would be "NA" because the report doesn't provide clear information on sample type, confirmed malignancy, or Gleason score. The mention of suspicious findings isn't enough to confirm malignancy, and the sample type isn't specified beyond "näytteet".
