Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion results should be reported, and the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Potilas käynyt rutiinitarkastuksissa... kuvantamisen jälkeen otettiin tarvittavat näytteet." The word "näytteet" translates to samples, but the type isn't specified. Terms like "biopsia" (biopsy) aren't present. The first sample had a technical failure, and others are mentioned but without specific procedure names. So Sampletype is probably "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text mentions "epäilyttäviä löydöksiä" (suspicious findings) in the samples, covering 5%. However, it's stated that the interpretation is difficult and requires more samples. There's no clear mention of malignancy (like "adenokarsinooma" or "pahanlaatuinen"). So Malignancy might be "ei" or "NA". But since the findings are suspicious but inconclusive, maybe "NA" is safer here.

For Gleason score, it's required only if malignancy is confirmed. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
