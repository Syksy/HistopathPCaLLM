Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the patient "originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." So the sample type here should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate" which is a malignant tumor. Even though the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, the primary site (prostate) has cancer. So Malignancy should be yes.

For Gleason grade, the highest or most severe lesion is considered. The text lists several patterns: 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The highest is 4+4=8. So the Gleason field should be "4+4=8".

I need to make sure not to include nested structures and only take the most severe Gleason. The other parts about lymph nodes being clear don't affect the malignancy field because the primary tumor is malignant. The sample type is definitely RP from the mention of radical prostatectomy. 

Double-checking the example given. The first example had a biopsy sample, malignancy yes, and the Gleason sum. The second example was gibberish, so all NA. Here, the key points are RP, yes for malignancy, and 4+4=8. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
