Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical report about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the patient "originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." So the sample type here should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which is a malignant tumor. Even though the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, the primary tissue still shows malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For Gleason, the highest grade is the most severe. The report lists several patterns: 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. The highest is 4+4=8. Even though there are other patterns, the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. So Gleason should be "4+4=8."

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value structure. Also, check if the statement is valid. This one clearly discusses histopathological findings, so it's valid. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8. That should be the correct structured data.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
