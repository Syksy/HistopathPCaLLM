Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the provided text, the samples are mentioned as "original primary prostate tissue" and they talk about lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text mentions "macroscopic sections," which might be part of a larger procedure, but without specific terms, I can't assume. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. "Clear" in medical terms usually means no malignancy detected. However, the primary prostate tissue findings aren't directly mentioned as malignant or benign. But since the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, it might imply that there's no spread, but the primary could still have malignancy. Wait, the summary says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, but the primary prostate tissue's findings "remain." The original sections' findings aren't detailed here. Since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor presence, maybe Malignancy is NA. But I need to be careful. If the primary tissue had findings that remain, but they aren't described here, perhaps the malignancy isn't confirmed. Alternatively, if the primary was previously known but not stated here, it's unclear. Since the text doesn't explicitly state the presence of a malignant tumor, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of Gleason scores or grades in the text, and if Malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be NA. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because there's no direct mention of tumor presence. Gleason is NA as there's no Gleason information. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here because the text doesn't provide the necessary details.
