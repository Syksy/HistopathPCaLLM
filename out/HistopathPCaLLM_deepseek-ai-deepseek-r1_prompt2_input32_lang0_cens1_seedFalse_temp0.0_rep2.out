Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, I need to read the provided statement carefully. The example given helps clarify the expected format. The key points are to identify the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade. But only the most severe lesion's results should be considered, and there shouldn't be any nested structures in the JSON.

Looking at the input statement: It mentions "samples from different locations" and "examination results are different from one sample to other." However, the summary states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear. The original primary prostate tissue is mentioned, but there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample type isn't clearly stated, so Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, but does that mean there's no malignancy? Wait, the primary prostate tissue findings "remain," but the summary doesn't mention any tumor. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor presence, Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? The example where malignancy is "no" would be if benign, but if there's no mention, maybe "NA". Wait, the allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report doesn't indicate any malignancy, but says the lymph nodes are clear, does that imply no malignancy? Or is it possible that the primary tissue had malignancy but the nodes are clear? The original primary prostate tissue's findings "remain," but the summary doesn't state any tumor. Since the user instructions say to take the most severe lesion, and if there's no mention of tumor, then Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? The example where the statement was invalid had "NA" for all. But here, the summary says lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, but the primary tissue's findings remain. If the primary tissue had findings but they aren't specified as malignant, maybe Malignancy is "NA". Alternatively, if the nodes are clear, but the primary might have malignancy, but it's not stated. Since the user instruction says to return "NA" if not clear, perhaps Malignancy is "NA".

For Gleason grade, since there's no mention of Gleason scores or grades in the statement, it should be "NA".

So the final JSON would have all fields as "NA".

 "Gleason": "NA"
