Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana" which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined." Then later, there are mentions of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being sampled. But the original sample type here is the radical prostatectomy, so the answer should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report states that the lymph nodes (näytteessä 1 and 2) and seminal vesicles (näytteet 3 ja 4) are clean ("puhtaat"), but the original prostate sample had adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores. However, the task is to report only the worst lesion's results. The original tumor had Gleason 4+4, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". The original tumor's worst was Gleason 4+4=8. Even though other scores like 3+3 are mentioned, we take the highest. Since there is malignancy, we report this. The current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign, but the original's worst is still valid. So Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the instructions say to report only the worst lesion's results. The original prostate had 4+4, which is the highest mentioned. The current samples are negative, but the original's findings remain ("Alkuperäisen prostatan primäärinäytteen makroleikkeiden löydökset jäävät siis voimaan."). So the malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+4=8. The sample type is RP because that's the original procedure. The current samples (lymph nodes etc.) are additional but the main sample type is RP.

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+4=8
</think>

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
