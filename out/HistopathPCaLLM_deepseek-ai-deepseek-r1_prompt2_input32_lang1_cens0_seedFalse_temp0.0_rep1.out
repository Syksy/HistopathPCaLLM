Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go through each of the three required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the first part mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana" which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined". Then later, there's mention of "imusolmukkeet" (lymph nodes) and "seminaalivehikkelit" (seminal vesicles) being sampled. However, the original sample type here is the radical prostatectomy (RP), as that's the initial procedure mentioned. The other samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are additional, but the main sample type is RP. So the first field should be "RP".

Next, determining if there are malignant findings. The report states that the original prostate had "multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta" (multifocal adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. However, the additional lymph nodes and seminal vesicles samples are clean ("puhtaat"). The question is whether the sample has malignant findings. Since the original sample (the prostate) did have cancer, but the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are benign, I need to check if the current samples (the ones being reported now) have malignancy. The report says the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, but the original prostate findings remain. However, the task is to report the worst lesion's results. The original prostate had Gleason 4+4, which is part of the current report's context. Wait, the user instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). The original prostate's Gleason 4+4 is the worst here, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are negative. However, the report mentions that the original prostate findings remain valid. So does the malignancy refer to the current samples or the original? The example given in the problem shows that if the report is about a biopsy with cancer, malignancy is "kyllä". Here, the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are negative, but the original prostate (RP sample) had cancer. Since the sample type is RP (the original prostate), and that sample had malignancy, then "Malignancy" should be "kyllä". Wait, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet) are part of the same report. The report is about the RP and the lymph nodes/seminal vesicles. The original prostate (RP) had cancer, but the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles do not. However, the task is to report the worst lesion's results. The worst lesion here is the original prostate's Gleason 4+4. So even though the current lymph nodes are negative, the primary sample (RP) had malignancy. Therefore, "Malignancy" is "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason score. The report mentions "basiksesta löytynyt gleason 4+4 tason kasvua, myös 3+3, 3+4 ja 4+3". The worst is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8". Even though there are other scores, we take the highest one.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8.
