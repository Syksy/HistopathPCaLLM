Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The report mentions "Alun perin ollut radikaali prostatektomia tutkittavana" which translates to "Originally a radical prostatectomy was examined." Then there's mention of lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) and seminal vesicles (seminaalivehikkelit) being sampled. But the original sample type here is the radical prostatectomy (RP), even though they later took lymph nodes and other samples. So the Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings in the sample. The original prostate had multifocal adenocarcinoma ("Alkuperäisestä multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta..."), which is malignant. However, the current samples (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) are clean ("puhtaat"). But the instructions say to consider the worst lesion's results. Since the original sample (RP) had malignancy, even if the new samples don't, the malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, we need the worst reported. The original prostate had Gleason 4+4, and also mentions 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The highest is 4+4=8. So the Gleason should be "4+4=8".

Wait, but the current samples (imusolmukkeet and seminaalivehikkelit) are benign. But the instruction says to take the worst lesion's results. The original prostate (RP) had Gleason 4+4, so that's the primary tumor's grade. Even though the new samples are negative, the worst is still from the original. So the answer should include that Gleason.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+4=8.
