Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text is: "PÄIVITYS: Potilaan näytteet eri erissä. Mediaanpituus oli 3cm ja pisin 5cm. Näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista. Tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen. Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan. Yhteenvetona, imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat."

Looking for keywords related to sample type. The text mentions "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" which translates to samples taken from different locations. But there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample is from "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" which just means original prostate tissue. Since there's no indication of the procedure type, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example shows that if adenocarcinoma is mentioned, malignancy is "kyllä". Here, the report states that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean ("imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat"). However, the main findings are from the original prostate tissue. The text mentions "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." which translates to findings from macroscopic sections of the original prostate tissue remain valid. But it doesn't explicitly state whether these findings are malignant. Since there's no mention of cancer (like adenokarsinooma) or malignancy indicators, and the lymph nodes are clean, but the original prostate findings are still valid, it's unclear. However, without explicit mention of malignancy, the safe answer might be "ei" or "NA". But wait, maybe the original prostate findings (from previous reports?) are being referenced here. The text is an update, so perhaps the original findings included malignancy. But since this report itself doesn't mention malignancy, maybe we should go with "NA". Alternatively, if the original prostate findings included cancer, but this report doesn't confirm it, it's ambiguous. Since the task is to process the given text, and the text here doesn't mention malignancy, the answer should be "NA".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "NA" here, Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, if malignancy isn't confirmed, it's still "NA". In this text, there's no mention of Gleason scores, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the text doesn't explicitly state presence or absence. Gleason is NA as no scores are mentioned.
