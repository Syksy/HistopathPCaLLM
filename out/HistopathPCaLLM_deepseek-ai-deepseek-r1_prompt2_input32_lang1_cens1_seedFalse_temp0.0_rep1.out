Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the text mentions "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" which translates to samples taken from different locations. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The original sample type isn't clearly stated, so I should mark this as "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan" which I think means the findings from the original prostate tissue remain. But there's no explicit mention of cancer or malignancy like "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) or "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant). The other parts mention lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean, which might indicate no spread, but that doesn't confirm presence in the sample. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the answer here is "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the report doesn't mention malignancy, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the original samples don't show malignancy, then "ei". But the example given in the problem uses "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma is present. Here, since there's no mention of cancer in the samples, maybe "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no mention of malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". So even if there was a Gleason mentioned, but no malignancy, it would be NA. In this case, there's no Gleason mentioned either. So definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are mentioned. Gleason is NA accordingly.
