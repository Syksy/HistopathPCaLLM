Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text is: "PÄIVITYS: Potilaan näytteet eri erissä. Mediaanpituus oli 3cm ja pisin 5cm. Näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista. Tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen. Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan. Yhteenvetona, imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat."

Looking for keywords related to sample type. The text mentions "näytteet otettu eri lokaatioista" (samples taken from different locations) and "alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta" (original prostate tissue). However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The samples could be from a biopsy, but the text doesn't specify. So Sampletype might be "NA".

Next, determining malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example shows that if adenocarcinoma is mentioned, malignancy is "kyllä". Here, the text mentions "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista... jäävät voimaan" which might mean previous findings are still valid. But the summary says "imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit puhtaat" (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean). However, the key part is whether there's a mention of malignancy in the current samples. Since the text says "Tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen" (results vary between samples), but doesn't explicitly state malignancy, and the summary doesn't mention cancer, maybe malignancy is "ei" (no) or "NA". Wait, but if previous findings are still valid, maybe there was malignancy before. But the current samples' results are varying. The problem states to consider only the worst lesion's results. Since the current report's summary doesn't mention any malignancy (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles clean), perhaps malignancy is "ei". But I need to check if there's any mention of malignant findings. The text doesn't mention adenocarcinoma or any cancer terms. So Malignancy might be "ei" or "NA". The example where malignancy is "NA" is when the text is nonsensical. Here, the text is coherent but doesn't mention malignancy. So maybe "ei" (no) because the summary says they are clean.

Third, Gleason score. If malignancy is "ei" or "NA", then Gleason is "NA". Since in this case, if there's no malignancy, Gleason would be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so "NA". Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found in the summary. Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy. 

Wait, but the text says "Löydökset makroskooppisista sektioista alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta jäävät voimaan." This might mean that previous findings (which could include malignancy) remain valid. But the current samples have varying results, and the summary states that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clean. If previous findings included malignancy, but the current samples don't confirm it, how to handle? The problem says to consider the worst lesion's results. If the current samples don't show malignancy, but previous ones do, but the user instruction says to process the given input text. The input text here is the current report. So if the current report's findings don't mention malignancy, then Malignancy is "ei". But if the previous findings (which are still valid) had malignancy, but the current samples don't, then it's unclear. However, the problem states to process the given lausunto (report), which in this case is the current one. The current report's summary doesn't mention malignancy, so Malignancy is "ei". Therefore, Gleason is "NA".
