Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "Radical prostatectomy preparate..." So RP is the sample type here. That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and there's a finding in lymph nodes (N1), which indicates malignancy. So the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the text says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". The user wants the most severe lesion reported. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the latter is considered more severe because the primary pattern is 4, which is higher grade. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value structure, so I'll follow that. Also, the user mentioned to only take the most severe lesion, which in this case is the 4+3=7. Even though both are mentioned, the 4+3 is worse than 3+4. 

Double-checking each part: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. All the values fit the allowed options. There's no ambiguity here. The statement is valid, so no NAs needed. The answer should be in valid JSON without any extra nesting.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
