Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Radical prostatectomy preparate started normally..." The term "radical prostatectomy" here indicates that the sample type is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and there's a finding in lymph nodes (N1), which suggests malignancy. Also, the presence of Gleason grades further supports malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the statement says "Gleason types 3+4/4+3". The user wants the most severe lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the latter is considered higher grade because the primary pattern is 4. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. All values are straightforward. The example given uses "4+3=7" as the format, so following that. The other details like T3b or lymph node involvement don't affect the Gleason field directly. Also, the sample type is clearly RP from "radical prostatectomy preparate". 

No mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. Malignancy is confirmed by tumor presence and lymph node findings. Gleason is the highest reported, which is 4+3=7. All other info like seminal vesicles being negative doesn't change these fields. So the final JSON should have those three values correctly filled.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
