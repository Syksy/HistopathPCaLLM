Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, I see terms like "Collected samples" and mentions of "lymph nodes" and "seminal vehicles". However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." Since seminal vesicles are mentioned and they found no malignancy, the answer here is "no". But wait, the user specified to consider the most severe lesion. However, the text explicitly states there are no malignant findings, so malignancy is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. Even if there were some numbers mentioned, like in the second example with random numbers, if malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. The given text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's confirmed.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. Double-checking the example where malignancy was "no" resulted in all NAs, but in this case, malignancy is "no" but sampletype and Gleason are NA. Wait, the example given in the problem where malignancy is "no" would have Gleason as NA. So the structure here should be correct.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
