Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text prostate cancer report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol." The term "collected samples" is vague. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP specifically. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." Wait, "seminal vehicles" might be a typo for "seminal vesicles." But regardless, the key part is "No malignant findings." So Malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be NA. The example given shows that if Malignancy is "no" or "NA," Gleason is "NA." There's no mention of any Gleason score here either.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "no" because they explicitly state no malignant findings, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy and no Gleason mentioned.
