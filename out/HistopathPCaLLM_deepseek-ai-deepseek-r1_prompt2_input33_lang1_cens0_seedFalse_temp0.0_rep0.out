Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The report mentions "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti". I know "radikaaliprostatektomia" is radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP". The typo in "prostatetoktomian" might be a mistake, but the context is clear.

Next, malignancy. The text states there's a tumor that has penetrated the capsule ("läpäissyt kapselia") and mentions "maligneja löydöksiä" in lymph nodes (1/4). So malignancy is present. The answer should be "kyllä".

For Gleason, the report says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". This indicates some variation, but we need the worst lesion. The options are 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Since the worst is primary pattern 4, the higher grade is 4+3=7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst Gleason is taken. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason 4+3=7. All other details like lymph nodes or seminal vesicles don't affect these specific fields. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
