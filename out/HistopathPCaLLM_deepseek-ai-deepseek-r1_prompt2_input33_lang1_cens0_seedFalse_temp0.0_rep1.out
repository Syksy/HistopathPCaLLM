Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The report mentions "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti". I recall that "radikaaliprostatektomia" is the Finnish term for radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states there's a tumor that has penetrated the capsule ("tumori on läpäissyt kapselia") and mentions "maligneja löydöksiä" in the context of lymph nodes, even though seminal vesicles were negative. The presence of a tumor (adenocarcinoma) indicates malignancy, so the answer here is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the report says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". This indicates some uncertainty between 3+4 and 4+3. However, the instruction is to take the worst lesion. Between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7, the primary pattern (major) is higher in 4+3, making it the worse grade. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst Gleason score. The example provided uses the highest major pattern when there's a range. Also, confirming that all values are correctly mapped to the allowed options. Everything seems to fit here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
