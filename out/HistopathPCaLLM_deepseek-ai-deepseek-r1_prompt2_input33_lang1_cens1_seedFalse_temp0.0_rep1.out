Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me start by understanding the requirements again.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". I need to look for keywords in the text that indicate the sample type. The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text is: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti. ... Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä. Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." 

Looking at the Finnish terms here, "näytteet" means samples, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The mention of "makroleikkeissä" refers to macrodissected pieces, which might be part of a larger sample, but without a clear indication of the sample type. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, the first field should be "NA".

Next, the malignancy field. The text states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles. But the question is whether there are any malignant findings in the sample. The key part here is "Ei maligneja löydöksiä", which translates to "No malignant findings". However, the sentence specifies "seminaalivesikkeleissä" (in the seminal vesicles). The report might have other areas, but according to the given text, the only mention of malignancy is the absence in seminal vesicles. But the question is about the presence of malignancy in the sample overall. Since the text says "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" in the seminal vesicles, but doesn't explicitly state that there are no malignancies elsewhere. Wait, the text also mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä." (Abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed macrodissected pieces). However, "abnormal" doesn't necessarily mean malignant. The next sentence clarifies that there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles, but what about the lymph nodes? The text doesn't explicitly say if the abnormal findings in lymph nodes are malignant. Since the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if there's any malignancy. If the report says "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" in the seminal vesicles but doesn't mention other areas, but the abnormal findings in lymph nodes are not confirmed as malignant. So, the malignancy field would be "ei" (no) because there's a statement that there are no malignant findings. Wait, but the "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" is specifically in the seminal vesicles. The report might have other areas, but the text here doesn't mention any malignancy elsewhere. However, the user instruction says to consider the worst lesion. If there's no mention of malignancy elsewhere, and only absence in seminal vesicles, but the presence of abnormal findings in lymph nodes (but not confirmed as malignant), then the malignancy would be "ei". Because the report states "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" in at least one area, and no other areas are mentioned as having malignancy. So, the answer here is "ei".

Third, the Gleason score. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason should be "NA". Because the instructions say to report Gleason only for malignant cases. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are reported. Gleason is NA accordingly.
