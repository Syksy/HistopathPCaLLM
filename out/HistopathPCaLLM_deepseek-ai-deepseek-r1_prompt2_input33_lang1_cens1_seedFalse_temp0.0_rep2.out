Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Kerätyt näytteet prosessoitu normaaliprotokollan mukaisesti." The key term here is "näytteet" which means samples, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text also mentions "makroleikkeissä" which refers to macrodissected pieces, but that doesn't specify the sample type. So, Sampletype is probably "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä." So, no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles. But the question is whether there are any malignant findings in the sample. The statement here specifies that there are no malignant findings in the seminal vesicles, but what about other parts? The earlier part mentions "Epänormaalit löydökset imusolmukkeista prosessoiduissa makroleikkeissä." Abnormal findings in lymph nodes processed in macrodissected pieces. However, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion and if there's any malignancy. The key phrase here is "Ei maligneja löydöksiä" which translates to "No malignant findings". So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported (Malignancy is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there are no malignant findings.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because there are no malignant findings, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
