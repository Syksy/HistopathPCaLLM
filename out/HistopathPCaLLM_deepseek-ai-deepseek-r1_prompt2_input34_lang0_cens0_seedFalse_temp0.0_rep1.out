Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement: "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr..." The term "resection" here is key. TURP is a type of resection, but sometimes RP is also a resection. However, the context might help. Since it's a prostate sample, TURP is a common procedure for removing prostate tissue, especially in cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The mention of "hyperplastic prostate tissue" further suggests it's TURP, as that's often the reason for TURP. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, Malignancy. The statement says, "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and "no malignities." So the answer here should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The example given shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and the JSON is valid. Also, check that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so nothing to worry about there.
