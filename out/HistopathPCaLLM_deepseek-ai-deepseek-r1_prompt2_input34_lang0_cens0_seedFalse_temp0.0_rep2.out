Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given statement starts with "The presented sample is a resection..." Resection here might be a clue. TURP is a type of resection, but sometimes RP is also a resection. However, the term "resection" alone isn't specific. But since there's no mention of radical prostatectomy or TURP explicitly, maybe I should check if there's any other indicator. The sample weighs 7.5 grams, which is a bit light for a full prostatectomy (RP specimens are usually heavier, like 30-50 grams). TURP samples are smaller. But the text doesn't specify TURP. However, the term "resection" is commonly associated with TURP in clinical contexts. Alternatively, maybe it's a partial resection. But since the options are limited, and the example given for biopsy uses "biopsy" when the text mentions biopsy. Here, the sample is a resection, but without more specifics, maybe the safest answer is "NA". Wait, but the user might expect TURP if it's a resection. Let me think again. TURP is a type of resection procedure. So if the sample is a resection, and it's from the prostate, then TURP is likely. But the problem is that RP is also a resection. However, RP is the surgical removal of the entire prostate, while TURP removes part of it. The weight here is 7.5 grams, which is more in line with a TURP specimen. RP specimens are usually much heavier. So Sampletype here might be TURP. But the text doesn't explicitly say TURP. Hmm. The example given in the problem statement uses "biopsy" when the text says "prostate biopsy". So maybe the key is to look for keywords. The text says "resection", but not TURP or RP. So according to the allowed values, if it's a resection but the type isn't specified, maybe the answer is NA. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in clinical terms, a resection of the prostate that's not a radical prostatectomy is considered TURP. But I'm not certain. Let's note this and move on to the next field.

Second, Malignancy. The statement says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and "no malignities." So clearly, the answer here is "no".

Third, Gleason. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA.

So putting it all together. Sampletype: The text mentions "resection", but without specifying TURP or RP. However, given the weight (7.5gr) is more in line with TURP. But the allowed values are TURP, RP, biopsy, or NA. Since the text doesn't explicitly state TURP or RP, maybe the answer is NA. Wait, but the example given in the problem statement for the first example used "biopsy" because the text said "prostate biopsy". So perhaps the rule is to use the allowed values only if the text explicitly mentions them or their common synonyms. Since "resection" is a general term, and the allowed values don't include "resection", maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, in some contexts, TURP is a type of resection. But without explicit mention, perhaps it's safer to put NA. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check the example again. The first example had "prostate biopsy" leading to "biopsy". The second example, which was invalid, had terms like "core" which might relate to biopsy but the answer was NA. So maybe the key is to look for specific terms. Since the sample is a resection, but the type isn't specified, maybe the answer is NA. Alternatively, if "resection" in prostate context is typically TURP, then TURP. But I'm not sure. Let's check medical terminology. TURP is a resection, but so is RP. However, RP is a radical prostatectomy. The weight here is 7.5 grams, which is very low for an RP (since the average prostate is about 20-30 grams). So a TURP sample would be smaller. Therefore, the sample type is likely TURP. But the problem is that the allowed values don't have "resection" as an option. So if the text says "resection" but doesn't specify TURP or RP, but the weight suggests TURP, should we infer TURP? The instructions say to use the allowed values. So if the text doesn't explicitly state TURP or RP, even if it's implied, maybe we should put NA. But the example shows that "biopsy" is used when the text says "prostate biopsy". So perhaps the rule is to map terms like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP" if present. Since the text here says "resection", which is a general term, but the allowed values don't include it, the answer would be NA. Therefore, Sampletype: NA.

So the final structured data would be:

Sampletype: NA (since resection isn't an allowed value and the type isn't specified)
Malignancy: no
Gleason: NA
