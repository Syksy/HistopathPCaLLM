Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes..." The term "tissue casettes" might suggest a biopsy, but the sample is a hyperplastic prostate tissue. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Findings do not indicate prostatic." Wait, that might be a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be "prostatic carcinoma"? The text also mentions hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is usually benign. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, just hyperplastic tissue. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is "no" because there's no indication of cancer. Gleason is NA because it's benign. I need to make sure there's no mention of the most severe lesion here, but since the findings are benign, there's no lesion to report. The answer should be all NAs except Malignancy as "no".
