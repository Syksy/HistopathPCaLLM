Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes..." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is just described by weight and preparation into cassettes. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, determining malignancy. The statement says, "Findings do not indicate prostatic." Wait, maybe that's a typo? It might mean "prostatic carcinoma" or something malignant. Then it mentions "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." Hyperplasia is benign, and chronic inflammation is also non-malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, tumor, or malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be NA. The example given shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with the benign finding.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have nested structures. Check the example where malignancy is "no" and Gleason is NA. Yes, that's correct. No errors here.
