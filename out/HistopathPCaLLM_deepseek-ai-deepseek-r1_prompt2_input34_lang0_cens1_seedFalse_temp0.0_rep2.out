Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes..." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is just described by weight and casettes. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Findings do not indicate prostatic. Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." Since it explicitly states that findings do not indicate prostatic (maybe a typo for prostatic carcinoma?) and mentions hyperplastic tissue, which is benign, Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, the rule is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is no here, Gleason should be NA.

So putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so that's straightforward.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
