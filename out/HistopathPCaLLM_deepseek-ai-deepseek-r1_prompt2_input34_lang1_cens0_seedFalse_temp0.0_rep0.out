Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "7.5gr resekaattia josta valmistettu 7gr kuudeksi kudoskasetiksi." The term "resekaattia" might be a typo or a Finnish term. Wait, the user is probably using Finnish medical terms. "Resekaattia" could be "resektio" which means resection. TURP is a type of resection. But the term here is a bit unclear. However, "resekaattia" might refer to resection, so TURP is a possible sample type. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if it's a radical prostatectomy, it would be RP. But the text doesn't mention prostatectomy. Let me check again. The sample is 7.5 grams, which is a bit small for a prostatectomy, which usually removes the entire prostate. TURP samples are usually smaller. So maybe TURP? But the Finnish word for TURP is "transuretraalinen prostatakudoksen poisto". The term "resekaattia" might be a typo for "resektio", which is resection. So TURP is a resection. So Sampletype would be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The text says: "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan... ei mitään malignia." So no malignancy. So Malignancy is "ei".

Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's a resection, likely TURP)
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

Wait, but the sample mentions "cribriform rakenteita". Cribriform can be a pattern in cancer, but the text explicitly states no adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So even if there's cribriform structures, if the report says no malignancy, then malignancy is "ei". So the answer should be as above.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
