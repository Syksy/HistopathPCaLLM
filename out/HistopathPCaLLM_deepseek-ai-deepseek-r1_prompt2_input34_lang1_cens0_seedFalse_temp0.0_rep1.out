Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a histopathological report of prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "7.5gr resekaattia josta valmistettu 7gr kuudeksi kudoskasetiksi." The term "resekaattia" might be a typo or a Finnish term. Wait, the user is probably using Finnish medical terms. "Resekaatti" could be "resectate," which is commonly associated with TURP. So the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The text states, "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan... ei mitään malignia." This clearly says there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason field should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there's no cancer detected. 

I need to make sure there's no mention of biopsy or RP. The sample preparation mentions "resekaattia" which points to TURP. Also, the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the absence of biopsy or RP terms and presence of resekaattia (resectate) leads to TURP.

Double-checking the malignancy part: the text explicitly states no signs of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So "ei" is correct. Gleason is only for malignant cases, so NA here.

No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. The answer should be straightforward.
