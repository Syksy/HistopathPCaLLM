Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text medical report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I'll look at the sample type. The original text mentions "7.5gr resekaattia" which translates to "7.5g resection." Resection specimens like TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or RP (radical prostatectomy) are common. Since TURP is a type of resection, but the term used here is "resekaattia," which is resection. However, in the allowed values, the options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. TURP is a specific type of resection, but if the text doesn't specify TURP, maybe it's RP? Wait, RP is radical prostatectomy, which is a different procedure. The sample here is a resection, but the exact type isn't specified as TURP or RP. Wait, the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" as the sample type when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, the sample is "resekaattia," which is a resection. But the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since the text doesn't specify whether it's TURP or RP, maybe I should put "NA"? But wait, "resection" in Finnish is "resektio," and "resekaattia" might be a typo or a form of the word. If the sample is a resection, but the type isn't clear, perhaps the correct answer is "TURP" if it's a transurethral resection. However, the text doesn't mention TURP explicitly. Alternatively, maybe "RP" if it's a radical prostatectomy. But the weight is 7.5 grams, which is small for a prostatectomy (prostates are usually 20-30 grams). TURP specimens are usually smaller. So maybe TURP? But the user instructions say to choose from the allowed values. Since the text says "resekaattia," which is resection, but the allowed values don't have a general "resection" option, only TURP or RP. Hmm. The example given in the instructions for "biopsy" was when the text said "biopsiasta." Here, since it's a resection, but the type isn't specified, perhaps the answer is "NA"? But maybe "TURP" is the correct choice because TURP is a type of resection. However, without explicit mention, it's safer to go with "NA" if unsure. But I need to check the original Finnish term again. "Resekaattia" is likely "resection" in Finnish. If the sample is a resection, but the type (TURP vs RP) isn't specified, then according to the allowed values, it's either TURP, RP, biopsy, or NA. Since the text doesn't specify, maybe "NA" is correct. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. In medical terms, a resection specimen from the prostate could be TURP or RP. If the weight is 7.5 grams, that's more in line with a TURP specimen (which removes part of the prostate) rather than a whole prostate (RP). So maybe "TURP" is the correct answer here. But the text doesn't explicitly say TURP. However, the term "resection" in prostate context often refers to TURP. So perhaps "TURP" is the intended answer here. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the sample type is "NA" because it's not explicitly stated. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta." So if the text says "resection," but the allowed values don't have a general resection, but TURP is a type of resection, then maybe "TURP" is the correct answer here. I'll go with "TURP" for sample type.

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitkään löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan" (No findings suggest prostate adenocarcinoma) and "ei mitään malignia" (no malignancy). So malignancy is "ei".

Gleason grade: Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA".

So the structured data would be:

Sampletype: TURP (since it's a resection, likely TURP)
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

Wait, but the user instructions say that for Gleason, it's "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

But let me double-check the sample type. The original text says "7.5gr resekaattia josta valmistettu 7gr kuudeksi kudoskasetiksi." Resection (resekaattia) is the sample. If the allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA, and the sample is a resection but not specified as TURP or RP, then perhaps "NA"? But in practice, a prostate resection is typically TURP unless stated otherwise. However, without explicit mention, maybe the answer should be "NA". But the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text said "biopsiasta". So if the text says "resekaattia" (resection), but the allowed values don't have "resection", but TURP is a type of resection, then perhaps "TURP" is correct. Alternatively, if the user expects that only when TURP or RP is explicitly mentioned, then "NA". But in medical context, a resection of the prostate without further specification is often TURP. So I think "TURP" is the right answer here. Therefore, the final JSON would be:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
</think>

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
