Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not mentioned. Looking at the given report: "Näyte painaa 7.5gr, joka on valmisteltu kuudelle kudoskasetille kokonaispainoltaan 7gr." The word "näyte" means sample, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is prepared into cassettes, which could be part of a biopsy or other procedures, but the text doesn't specify. So Sampletype might be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states: "Hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta kroonisella inflammaatiolla nähdään." Hyperplasia with chronic inflammation is benign. Also, "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." The findings don't indicate prostate issues, but wait, the original text says "eivät viittaa eturauhasen" – maybe a typo? It should probably be "eivät viittaa eturauhassyöpään" (do not indicate prostate cancer). So malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score should be "NA". The report doesn't mention Gleason grades or any cancer, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
