Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näyte painaa 7.5gr, joka on valmisteltu kuudelle kudoskasetille kokonaispainoltaan 7gr." The word "näyte" means sample, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample is prepared into cassettes, which could be part of various procedures, but the text doesn't specify. So Sampletype might be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta kroonisella inflammaatiolla nähdään." Hyperplasia with chronic inflammation is benign. Also, "Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen." The findings don't indicate prostate issues, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy. The JSON should have no nested structures. Let me double-check the Finnish terms. "Cribriform kasvua" refers to growth pattern, but without mention of cancer. The key terms for malignancy like "adenokarsinooma" or "karsinooma" are absent. So the answer seems correct.

 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
