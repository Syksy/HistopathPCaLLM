Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not specified. Looking at the given report, the text mentions "Näyte painaa 7.5gr, joka on valmisteltu kuudelle kudoskasetille..." which translates to a sample prepared into six cassettes. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "prostatabiopsioita" was in the example but not here. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. Wait, the example had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the sample is just referred to as "näyte" (sample) without specifying the type. So Sampletype would be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "Hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta kroonisella inflammaatiolla nähdään." which translates to hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy terms like "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) or "pahanlaatuinen" (malignant). The findings don't indicate cancer, so Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" as there's no cancer mentioned, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
