Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are from left and right lobe." The term "samples" here is a bit vague. It doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since the sample type isn't specified, I should default to "NA" for this field.

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement mentions "small high-grade PIN-changes". High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, which would indicate malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed value is a "major+minor=sum" format or "NA" if benign. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable here. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. In this case, the most severe finding is high-grade PIN, which isn't malignant. So, the structured data should reflect that there's no malignancy.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as "NA", Malignancy as "no", and Gleason as "NA".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
