Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples are from left and right lobe." The term "samples" is a bit generic. It doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the statement mentioned "prostate biopsy," but here there's no such specification. So I think Sampletype should be NA here because it's not clear what type of sample it is.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement mentions "small high-grade PIN-changes." High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor to cancer but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia, which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, which would indicate malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no."

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable here. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores either. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since the most severe here is high-grade PIN, which isn't malignant, the answers align with that.
