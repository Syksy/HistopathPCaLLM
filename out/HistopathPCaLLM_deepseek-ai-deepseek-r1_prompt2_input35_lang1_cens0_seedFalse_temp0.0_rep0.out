Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Näytteenä 1-6 on edustavat biopsiat oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta." The key word here is "biopsiat", which translates to biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta." Karsinooma means carcinoma, which is malignant. Since there's no sign of carcinoma, malignancy should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason score should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no other mentions of malignancy or Gleason. The text mentions high-grade PIN changes, but PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is not carcinoma. Hyperplasia is benign. So no malignancy detected. Therefore, all criteria point to the sample being a biopsy, no malignancy, and no Gleason score.
