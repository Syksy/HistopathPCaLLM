Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text here is "Näytteet vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta." The word "näytteet" translates to samples, but the type isn't specified. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't clear. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia." PIN stands for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. High-grade PIN (HGPIN) is a precancerous condition but isn't malignant itself. The other findings are hyperplasia and some tissue formations, which are benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or carcinoma, which would indicate malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, it's only reported if there's malignancy. Since there's no malignancy here, Gleason should be "NA".

So the final JSON should have all fields as NA except Malignancy as "ei". Wait, no. Wait, the malignancy is "ei" because there's no malignant findings. Let me double-check. The text says "pieniä korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia" which is HGPIN, not cancer. Hyperplasia is benign. No mention of cancer. So yes, malignancy is "ei". Therefore, the JSON should be:

Sampletype: NA
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

Yes, that makes sense. The example given in the problem had a case where malignancy was "kyllä" and Gleason was provided. Here, since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The sample type isn't specified, so NA. Correct.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
