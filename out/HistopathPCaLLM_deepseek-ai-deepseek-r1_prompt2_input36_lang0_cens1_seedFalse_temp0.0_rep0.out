Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of cassettes might relate to how the sample was processed, but without explicit terms like biopsy or TURP, I can't assume. So Sampletype would be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia. Hyperplasia generally refers to an increase in cell number, which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, or malignancy. The statement also says "was not assessed reliably," but that doesn't confirm malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The example shows that if Malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA. So Gleason would be NA.

I need to make sure I'm only considering the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no malignant lesion reported. The answer should be straightforward with all fields as NA except Malignancy which is "no". Let me double-check the example where if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. Yes, that's correct. So the final JSON should have Sampletype: NA, Malignancy: no, Gleason: NA.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
