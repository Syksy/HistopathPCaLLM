Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Preparaatti painaa 80 grammaa ja on kooltaan noin 7 x 6 x 5 cm. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 tavallista kasettia." The mention of "preparaatti" (specimen) and the size (80 grams, dimensions) might suggest a radical prostatectomy (RP), as those are typically larger specimens. But the text doesn't explicitly mention RP or TURP. However, the preparation of 8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes could be indicative of a surgical specimen like RP. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe the sample type is NA here. But I need to check if there are any clues. The size is 80 grams, which is larger than a typical biopsy. RP specimens are usually larger. But without explicit terms like "radikaaliprostatektomia" (radical prostatectomy) or "leikkaus" (surgery), maybe it's safer to put NA. Hmm, but sometimes in reports, the sample type isn't explicitly stated. Let me think again. The example used "biopsy" when the text said "biopsiasta". Here, there's no such term. So perhaps the sample type is NA.

Second, malignancy. The text says "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." So "ei löydy" means not found. So malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. Let me check the example again. In the example where malignancy was present, Gleason was filled. Here, malignancy is "ei", so Gleason is NA. That makes sense.
