Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The sample provided is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the keywords here are "Preparaatti" which means specimen, and mentions of "makrokasettia" and "tavallista kasettia" (macro cassettes and regular cassettes). There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The sample seems to be from a surgical specimen, possibly a prostatectomy, but the text doesn't specify. So I might have to put "NA" here since it's not clear.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "Maligniteettia... ei löydy" which translates to "No malignancy found." So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the origin isn't specified, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The given text doesn't mention any cancer, so all criteria are met.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
