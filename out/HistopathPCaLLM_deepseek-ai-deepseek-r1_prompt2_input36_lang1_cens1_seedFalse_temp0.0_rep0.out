Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion's results should be reported, and the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The mention of "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" (macro cassettes and normal cassettes) might relate to how the sample was processed, but the original sample type isn't explicitly stated. Terms like "biopsia" (biopsy), "radikaaliprostatektomia" (RP), or "TURP" (transurethral resection) aren't present here. So the sample type isn't clear. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text says "Makroskooppisesti tutkittaessa näytteistä löydettiin nodulaarista hyperplasiaa, mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan." Nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia are benign conditions. However, the last part mentions they couldn't reliably assess. But since hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy indicators, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score: The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades (like 3+4=7) or terms related to adenocarcinoma. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

So the JSON would have all fields as "NA" except Malignancy as "ei". Wait, but the instructions say if malignancy is "ei", then Gleason is "NA". That's correct here. Let me double-check the text again. No mention of cancer, just hyperplasia. So yes, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason "NA". Sampletype not specified, so "NA".

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
