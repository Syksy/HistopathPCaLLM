Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." The mention of "makrokasettia" and "normaalia kasettia" might refer to how the sample was processed, but there's no clear indication of the sample's origin like "biopsia" (biopsy) or terms related to RP or TURP. So Sampletype is probably NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Makroskooppisesti tutkittaessa näytteistä löydettiin nodulaarista hyperplasiaa, mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan." Hyperplasia is usually benign, and they couldn't reliably assess malignancy. So Malignancy would be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or NA. Since hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of malignancy, but the assessment wasn't reliable. Hmm. The key is whether malignant findings were present. The text doesn't mention any malignancy, just hyperplasia. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score: Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because it's benign.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings. Gleason is NA.
