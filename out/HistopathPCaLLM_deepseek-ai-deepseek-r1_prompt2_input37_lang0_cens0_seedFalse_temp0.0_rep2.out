Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specific, so I have to be careful.

First, the original sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." The term "electrosection chippings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP often involves removing tissue using electrocautery. So Sampletype might be TURP here.

Next, malignancy. The statement says "Findings indicate hyperplasia." Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The example given shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. The input doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which reinforces that.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of a more severe lesion elsewhere, but the input only talks about hyperplasia and minor inflammation, so that's the most severe. No nested structures, just flat JSON. Check the example again to confirm formatting. Looks good.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
