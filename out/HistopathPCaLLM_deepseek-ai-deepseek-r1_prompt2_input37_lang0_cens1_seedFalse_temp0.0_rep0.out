Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I stick to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Less than half of the total sample material preparated. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in places. Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week." The text mentions "sample material" and "samples are going to be examined further next week." However, it doesn't explicitly state the type of sample like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation", but there's no mention of adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, or any malignant terms. The report also states that further examination wasn't possible yet. Since there's no indication of malignancy found, but the exam isn't complete, should I mark it as "no" or "NA"? The instructions say to use "NA" if the information isn't available. Since the exam is pending, it's possible malignancy wasn't assessed yet. So, Malignancy would be "NA".

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason score isn't provided, this field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and Gleason isn't reported. The example given for an invalid statement also results in all NAs, which seems similar here since the current data is inconclusive and pending further tests.
