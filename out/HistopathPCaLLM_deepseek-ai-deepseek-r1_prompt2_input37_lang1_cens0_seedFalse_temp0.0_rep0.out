Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Preparaattina 7g elektrosektiolastuja." The term "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to "electroresection chips," which is typically associated with TURP procedures. So the Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report mentions "hyperplasia," which is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The findings here are benign, so Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3, 4, or 5, or any sum.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided uses "kyllä" for malignancy when present, so here "ei" is correct. No Gleason score is applicable here, so NA is appropriate.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
