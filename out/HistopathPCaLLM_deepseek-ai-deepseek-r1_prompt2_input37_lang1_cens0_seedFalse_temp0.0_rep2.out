Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Preparaattina 7g elektrosektiolastuja." The term "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens. So the sample type should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydös siis hyperplasia." Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. So malignancy is "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Even if there was a Gleason mentioned, but no malignancy, it would still be NA. In this case, there's no mention of Gleason, so definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, elektrosektiolastuja is TURP, hyperplasia is benign. All set.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
