Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "näytemateriaalista" which translates to sample material. However, there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The report just talks about the sample being prepared, but not the type. So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text describes seeing prostate tissue with some nodular gland components and slight inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, cancer, or malignancy. The report also states that a more detailed examination wasn't possible yet, and samples will be examined more next week. Since there's no indication of malignancy found so far, Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of cancer, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy reported. So the JSON should reflect all NAs except Malignancy as "ei".

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
