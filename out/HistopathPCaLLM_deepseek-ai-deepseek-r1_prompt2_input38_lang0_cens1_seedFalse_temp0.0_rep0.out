Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The goal is to determine three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, I need to parse the given statement. The input text is: "Representative samples are collected. Total measurements provided in millimeters. In histological examination, some finding including hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found."

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the statement, there's no mention of the sample type. It mentions "representative samples" but doesn't specify the procedure. So, I can't determine if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation." Hyperplasia is a benign condition, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases or "NA" if benign. Since the malignancy is "no", the Gleason grade isn't applicable here. Thus, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignant lesion mentioned. The example provided in the instructions shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. Also, the sample type wasn't specified, so that's NA as well.

Double-checking for any possible oversight. The text mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue" which is benign. No indicators of cancer. So the structured data should be all NAs except Malignancy as "no".
