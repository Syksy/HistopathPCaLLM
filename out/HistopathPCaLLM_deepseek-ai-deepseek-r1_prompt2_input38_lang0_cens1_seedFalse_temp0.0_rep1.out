Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input statement: "Representative samples are collected. Total measurements provided in millimeters. In histological examination, some finding including hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found." The text mentions "representative samples" and "histological examination," but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation." Hyperplasia is a benign condition, not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is no, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason isn't applicable. The example provided for a benign case also uses NA for all fields, but here Malignancy is "no" because it's explicitly benign. Wait, in the example given by the user, when the statement was invalid, all were NA. But in a valid benign case, like this one, Malignancy should be "no". Let me confirm the allowed values: for Malignancy, "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the sample is benign (hyperplastic), the answer is "no". So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
