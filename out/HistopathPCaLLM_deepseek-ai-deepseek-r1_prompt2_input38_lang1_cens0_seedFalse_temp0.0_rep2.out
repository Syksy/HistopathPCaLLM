Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana edustavia neulabiopsioita." The word "neulabiopsioita" translates to "needle biopsies," so the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Ei epäiltyä maligniteettia," which means "No suspicion of malignancy." So the malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason is "NA".

Now, I need to structure this into JSON without nested structures. Let me verify each part again. Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is ei, Gleason is NA. The example provided uses "kyllä" for yes and "ei" for no, which matches here. The sample type is correctly identified as biopsy. All criteria are met. No issues here. The answer should be straightforward.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
