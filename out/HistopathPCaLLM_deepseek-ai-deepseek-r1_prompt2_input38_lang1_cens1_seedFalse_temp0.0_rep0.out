Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä, joiden kokonaismitta annettuna millimetreissä." The key term here is "kudosnäytteitä", which translates to "tissue samples". However, the report doesn't specify the exact type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't clearly mentioned, so I should put "NA" here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Histologisesti nähdään muun muassa hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota." Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Lastly, the Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason score should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3+4=7 or similar, which further supports that.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because there's no mention of cancer, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy to report a score for.
