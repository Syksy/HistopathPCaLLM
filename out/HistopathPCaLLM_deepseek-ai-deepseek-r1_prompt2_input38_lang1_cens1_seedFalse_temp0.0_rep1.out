Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä, joiden kokonaismitta annettuna millimetreissä." The key term here is "kudosnäytteitä", which translates to "tissue samples". However, the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The report just mentions tissue samples without specifying the procedure. So, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The text states: "Histologisesti nähdään muun muassa hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota." Translating this, it mentions hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Hyperplasia is benign, and chronic inflammation is also not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, or any malignant terms. So, Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which supports this.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. The example provided for a non-malignant case also uses "NA" for all fields except Malignancy set to "ei". 

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "hyperplastista" is hyperplasia (benign), "kroonista inflammaatiota" is chronic inflammation. No signs of malignancy. No mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP procedures. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as ei, and Gleason as NA.

 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
