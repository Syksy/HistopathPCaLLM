Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavana edustavia kudosnäytteitä, joiden kokonaismitta annettuna millimetreissä." The key term here is "kudosnäytteitä" which translates to tissue samples. However, the original sample type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, so the sample type should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Histologisesti nähdään muun muassa hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota." Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma (adenokarsinooma) or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score should be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. The input text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, so that's confirmed.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The required fields are straightforward. Let me double-check the Finnish terms. Hyperplastista is hyperplasia, which is benign. Kroonista inflammaatiota is chronic inflammation, also not malignant. No signs of cancer here. So the answer should have Sampletype as NA, Malignancy as "ei", and Gleason as NA.
