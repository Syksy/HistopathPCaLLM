Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement: "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation..." The term "prostatectomy" here is key. Since it's a prostatectomy sample, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor..." and specifically refers to Gleason grades. The presence of a tumor with Gleason grading indicates malignancy. So, Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example format is "major+minor=sum". The text says "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. The correct format would be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The statement mentions 3 foci, but the Gleason grades are given as 3 and 4, leading to a sum of 7. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere, so this is the most severe.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON. All values should be straightforward. The sample type is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7. No issues with invalid entries here. The example provided uses "biopsy" and "4+3=7", so following that structure.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
