Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation..." The term "prostatectomy" here is key. Since it's a prostatectomy sample, the Sampletype should be "RP". I don't see any mention of biopsy or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so RP is the right choice here.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor..." and specifically refers to Gleason grades. The presence of a tumor with Gleason grading indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The statement says "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." Here, major is 3 and minor is 4, summing to 7. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions 3 foci, but the Gleason 3+4=7 is specified, so that's the primary one. There's no mention of higher grades elsewhere. Also, the example provided uses the format "4+3=7", so following that structure is important.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON. All fields are top-level. Check for any typos or misinterpretations. The sample type is definitely RP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is correctly formatted. The answer should be straightforward here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
