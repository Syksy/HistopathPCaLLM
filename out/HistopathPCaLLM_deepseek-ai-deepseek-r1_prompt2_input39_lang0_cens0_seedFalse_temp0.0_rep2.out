Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation..." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate, so RP (radical prostatectomy) is the sample type here. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor..." and specifically talks about Gleason grades. Since a tumor is mentioned and Gleason grading is typically for malignant cases, Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example shows the format "major+minor=sum". The text states "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... therefore Gleason grade is 7." So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. The correct format would be "3+4=7".

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The example uses the highest Gleason score from the foci mentioned. Here, the major is 3 and minor 4, which sums to 7. There's no mention of a higher grade elsewhere, so this is the most severe.

No nested structures allowed, so the JSON should be flat. The other details like tumor foci, marginal status, and absence of penetrative growth don't affect the three required fields.

Putting it all together, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
