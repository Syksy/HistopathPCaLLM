Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I stick to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations..." There's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it's uncertain and there's no definitive mention of malignancy, the Malignancy field should be "NA". The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the report is inconclusive, "NA" is appropriate here.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The statement explicitly mentions, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." So there's no Gleason score provided. The allowed value here is "NA" for benign statements or when it can't be assessed. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, all three fields will be "NA" because the sample type isn't mentioned, malignancy is inconclusive, and the Gleason score isn't assessable. I need to ensure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. Also, the user specified to only return results from the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions, so all fields default to "NA".

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
