Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, and I need to make sure I only consider the most severe lesion mentioned, without any nested structures.

First, I'll look at the sample statement provided. The example given is a clear case where all three fields are present. The user also provided an example of an invalid statement where the output is all "NA". This tells me that if the text is unclear or doesn't contain the necessary information, I should default to "NA" for each field.

Now, looking at the current input: "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations. But it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings. Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

Breaking this down:

1. **Sampletype**: The original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input mentions "sample under examination" and "slices extracted", but there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, I can't determine the sample type here. Hence, Sampletype should be "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: Whether there were malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it's uncertain, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report is inconclusive, the answer here should be "NA".

3. **Gleason grade**: The example shows that if the Gleason score is mentioned, it should be in the format "major+minor=sum". However, the input states, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." Therefore, there's no Gleason grade reported, so this should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is inconclusive, and the Gleason score isn't assessable. I need to ensure that the JSON is valid and doesn't include any nested structures. Also, since the instructions mention to consider only the most severe lesion, but in this case, there's no lesion described, the default applies.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
