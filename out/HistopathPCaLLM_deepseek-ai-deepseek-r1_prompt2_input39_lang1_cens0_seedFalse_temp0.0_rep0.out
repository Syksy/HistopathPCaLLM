Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a JSON structure. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Tutkittavana prostatektomiapreparaatti". "Prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The report mentions "löydetään kasvain" (a tumor is found) and talks about Gleason grades, which are indicators of cancer. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "major+minor=sum". The text says "Gleason 3 (major) että 4... Gleason grade 7". So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. The format should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures. The answer should be straightforward. Let me double-check each part. Sample type is definitely RP. Malignancy is confirmed. Gleason is correctly formatted. All fields are present and correct. No issues here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
