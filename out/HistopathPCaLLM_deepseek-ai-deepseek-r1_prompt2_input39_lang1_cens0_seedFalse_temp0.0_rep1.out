Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Tutkittavana prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to "The specimen examined is a prostatectomy specimen." Prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a prostatectomy sample, so RP is the correct sample type here.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "löydetään kasvain," which means "a tumor is found." Additionally, it talks about Gleason grades, which are indicators of prostate cancer. So, malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason 3 (major) että 4... Gleason grade 7." The major pattern is 3 and minor is 4, so the sum is 7. The correct format is "3+4=7" or "4+3=7" depending on which is major. Here, it specifies "Gleason 3 (major)" so the major is 3 and minor is 4, making it "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided uses the format "major+minor=sum," so following that, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Double-checking each part: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is correctly formatted. There's no mention of biopsy or TURP, so RP is correct. The malignancy is confirmed by the presence of a tumor. The Gleason score is explicitly given, so no issues there.

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
