Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Tutkittavana prostatektomiapreparaatti," which translates to "Under examination, prostatectomy specimen." Prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a prostatectomy sample. RP stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "löydetään kasvain," which means "a tumor is found." The presence of a tumor indicates malignancy. Additionally, they mention Gleason grades, which are used for cancerous tissue. So, the malignancy field should be "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason grade, the text states "Gleason 3 (major) että 4... Gleason grade 7." The correct format is major + minor = sum. Here, major is 4 and minor is 3, leading to 4+3=7. Wait, the text says "Gleason 3 (major)" and 4. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Normally, the major pattern is the higher grade. If it's stated as Gleason 3 being major and 4 as minor, that would be 3+4=7. But the text says "Gleason 3 (major) että 4 erilaistumisasteella... Gleason grade 7." Hmm, maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

The original Finnish text says: "Näillä alueilla nähdään positiivinen marginaali noin 1.5mm suuruiselta alueelta. Löydetään sekä Gleason 3 (major) että 4 erilaistumisasteella näissä fokuksissa, siten Gleason grade 7." So, they found both Gleason 3 (major) and 4. Wait, if 3 is major, then the sum would be 3+4=7. But typically, the major component is the higher grade. However, the text explicitly states that Gleason 3 is the major component. So according to the report, it's 3 (major) +4 (minor) =7. But the standard notation is major (higher grade) first. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." So in the example, the order is as mentioned. Here, the text says "Gleason 3 (major) ja 4," so the major is 3 and minor is 4. But that's conflicting because the higher grade should be the major. However, the report might have a typo, or maybe the major refers to the most prevalent pattern, not the higher grade. But according to Gleason scoring, the primary grade is the most common pattern, and the secondary is the next most common, but the sum is primary + secondary. However, in the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups), the primary is the higher grade. Wait, no. The original Gleason score is the sum of the most predominant grade (primary) and the next most predominant (secondary), regardless of their order. For example, if the primary is 3 and secondary is 4, the score is 3+4=7. If primary is 4 and secondary is 3, it's 4+3=7. Both are considered Gleason 7 but different Grade Groups. So in this case, the report says "Gleason 3 (major)" which would mean primary pattern 3 and secondary 4, leading to 3+4=7. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7" when the text mentions "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order in the JSON should follow the major and minor as stated in the text. Here, the text says "Gleason 3 (major) ja 4", so the major is 3 and minor is 4, hence "3+4=7". But wait, the user's example has "4+3=7" when the text lists 4 and 3. So the order in the JSON is major + minor, regardless of numerical order. So in this case, the report states major is 3 and minor is 4, so the correct format would be "3+4=7". However, I need to check the exact wording. The Finnish text says "Löydetään sekä Gleason 3 (major) että 4 erilaistumisasteella näissä fokuksissa, siten Gleason grade 7." So they found both 3 (major) and 4. So the major component is 3, minor is 4. Therefore, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. But according to standard practice, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next. However, the user's instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. Wait, the user's instruction says: "Ota huomioon että vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" which means "Take into account that only the worst lesion's results should be returned." So even if there are multiple foci, we take the worst one. The text mentions "kolme fokusta" (three foci) with positive margins, and in these foci, both Gleason 3 (major) and 4. So the worst would be the highest Gleason. But if in a focus, the major is 3 and minor is 4, the sum is 7. If another focus has higher, but the text doesn't mention higher. So the worst here is 3+4=7. But the user's example uses the order as mentioned in the text. So in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", so the JSON is "4+3=7". Here, the text says "Gleason 3 (major) ja 4", so the JSON should be "3+4=7". But wait, maybe the major refers to the higher grade. Wait, no. The term "major" here might refer to the primary pattern, which is the most extensive, not necessarily the higher grade. So if the primary (major) is 3 and secondary (minor) is 4, the sum is 3+4=7. However, in modern grading, the primary is the higher grade. But the text explicitly states that Gleason 3 is the major. So we have to follow what's written. Therefore, the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But I need to confirm. The user's example uses the order as they appear in the text. So if the text says "4 ja 3", it's "4+3=7". Here, the text says "3 (major) ja 4", so it's "3+4=7". Therefore, the correct Gleason entry is "3+4=7".
