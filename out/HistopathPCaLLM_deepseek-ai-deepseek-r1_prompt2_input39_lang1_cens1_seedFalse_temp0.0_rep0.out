Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: the sample is described as "Tutkittavana näyte, jonka koko 20. Kudoksesta otetaan muutamia leikkeitä..." The key term here is "leikkeitä", which translates to "slices" or "sections". However, the sample type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions taking some sections from the tissue, but without a clear procedure name. So maybe the sample type isn't specified here, hence "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "ei selvyyttä onko näkyvillä hyvänlaatuista hyperplasiaa tai jotain malignia." So they couldn't determine if there's benign hyperplasia or something malignant. Since it's uncertain, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since it's unclear, the answer here should be "NA".

For Gleason score, the text explicitly states "Gleason scorea ei pystytty määrittämään." So it's not determined. The format requires "major+minor=sum" for malignant cases, but since malignancy isn't confirmed and the score couldn't be determined, it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain, and Gleason is NA because it couldn't be determined. The example given for an unclear case also uses NA for all fields, so this fits.
