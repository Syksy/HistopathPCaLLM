Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Tutkittavana näyte, jonka koko 20. Kudoksesta otetaan muutamia leikkeitä..." The key word here is "leikkeitä," which translates to "slices" or "sections." But I need to map this to the allowed values: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term "leikkeitä" might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the example given in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta," which is clear. Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The sample is just a piece of tissue taken, but without specific procedure names. So maybe the sample type is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The text says "ei selvyyttä onko näkyvillä hyvänlaatuista hyperplasiaa tai jotain malignia." So they couldn't determine if there's benign hyperplasia or something malignant. Since it's uncertain, the malignancy field should be NA. The allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since it's not confirmed, NA is appropriate.

For Gleason score, the text explicitly states "Gleason scorea ei pystytty määrittämään." So Gleason is not determined. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings, but here it's unclear if it's malignant. However, since malignancy is NA, Gleason should also be NA. The example shows that if malignancy is "kyllä," then Gleason is provided, otherwise NA. Here, since malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is NA because it's uncertain. Gleason is NA because it couldn't be determined.
