Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" often refers to tissue fragments obtained from a TURP procedure. So I think Sampletype here is TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." That clearly states there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The Gleason score is only applicable when there's a malignant tumor. The example given also shows that if malignancy is "no", Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Also, confirm that the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so nothing else applies.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
