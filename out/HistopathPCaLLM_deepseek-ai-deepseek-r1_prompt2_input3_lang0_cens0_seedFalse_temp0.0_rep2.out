Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement. The fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading the provided text carefully.

The sample is described as "prostate chippings." From what I remember, "chippings" are typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not referred to as chippings. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) would be the entire prostate, so that's not it. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." That's a clear statement. So Malignancy is "no."

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade isn't applicable. The allowed value here is "NA" for benign cases. The example given also uses "NA" for Gleason when there's no malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. Let me double-check the example to confirm the format. Yep, it's straightforward key-value pairs. All looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
