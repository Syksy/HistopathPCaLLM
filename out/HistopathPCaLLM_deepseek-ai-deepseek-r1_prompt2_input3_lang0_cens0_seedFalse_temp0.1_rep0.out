Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the sample statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" often refers to tissue fragments obtained from a TURP procedure. So Sampletype here should be TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." That clearly states there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have Sampletype as TURP, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA. I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so no Gleason to report. Double-checking the example provided for a benign case confirms that NA is correct for all fields when there's no malignancy. Wait, no, in the example given where it's invalid, all are NA, but here, the sample type is valid (TURP), malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. So the answer should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
