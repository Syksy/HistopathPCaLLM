Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." The term "prostate chippings" is commonly associated with TURP procedures, where tissue is removed in small pieces. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." That clearly states there's no malignancy. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since the sample is benign (no malignancy), the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. There's no mention of any Gleason score here, which aligns with the absence of malignancy.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure is correct, with no nested elements. Also, only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the example given. For a benign case, all fields are NA except Malignancy is "no" here. Wait, in the example where the statement was invalid, all were NA, but here, since it's a valid statement but benign, Malignancy is "no", Sampletype is TURP, and Gleason is NA. That makes sense.

Yes, that's correct. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as TURP, Malignancy as no, and Gleason as NA.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
