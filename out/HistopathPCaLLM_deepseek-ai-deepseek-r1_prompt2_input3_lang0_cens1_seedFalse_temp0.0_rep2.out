Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not mentioned. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The text mentions "primary sample" and "prostate material" but doesn't specify the type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says there's some inflammation but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination. It concludes that nothing conclusive can be derived. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected, and the exam was inconclusive, Malignancy should be NA. It's not explicitly stated as yes or no, so NA is appropriate.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it's in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, and the exam was inconclusive, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields are NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't determined, and Gleason isn't reported.
