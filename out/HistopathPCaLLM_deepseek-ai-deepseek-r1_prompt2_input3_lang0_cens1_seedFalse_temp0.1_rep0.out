Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The mention of "prostate material" and "single run" isn't specific. The text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP explicitly. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination... nothing conclusive may be derived." Since the examination was hindered and no malignancy is mentioned, the answer here would be "no" because there's no indication of malignancy found, but wait—the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. However, the instructions say to use NA if the statement isn't valid. But in this case, the statement is about the sample but the results are inconclusive. The absence of conclusive results due to artifacts might mean that malignancy can't be determined, so maybe "NA" is better here. Wait, the user specified that if the statement isn't valid, use NA. But this is a valid statement, just inconclusive. The question is whether there were malignant findings. Since they couldn't examine properly, they didn't find any malignancy, but does that mean "no" or "NA"? The example given for an invalid statement had gibberish, but here the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user's example for a valid statement with no malignancy would have "no". But in this case, since the examination was prevented, maybe it's better to put "NA" for Malignancy because they couldn't determine it. Hmm, but the user's instructions say "were there malignant tumor findings" – if the report says nothing about malignancy because they couldn't examine, then maybe it's "NA". Alternatively, if the report states no malignancy found, then "no". But here, it's stated that "nothing conclusive may be derived", so they can't say yes or no. Therefore, Malignancy should be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of any tumor or malignancy, and the examination was inconclusive, Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. The example given for an invalid statement also returns all NAs, but this case is a valid statement with inconclusive results. Wait, the user's example of an invalid statement was because the text was gibberish. Here, the text is a valid report but inconclusive. However, the user's instructions say to return the most severe lesion's results. Since there's no lesion mentioned, just inflammation and artifacts, all fields should be NA. So the answer should be all NAs.
