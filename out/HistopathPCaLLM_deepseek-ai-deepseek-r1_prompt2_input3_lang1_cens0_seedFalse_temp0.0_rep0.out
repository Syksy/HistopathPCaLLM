Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text here is "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since that procedure often results in chip-like fragments. So Sampletype might be "TURP". But I should check if there's any other indication. The example given for biopsy used "biopsiasta", which is biopsy in Finnish. Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP explicitly. However, "lastuja" is commonly associated with TURP specimens. So I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." That translates to "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here should be "ei" (no). The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since there's a clear statement that malignancy isn't present, "ei" is correct.

For Gleason score, the rule is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which reinforces that decision.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sample mentions "strooman hyperplasiasta" which is stromal hyperplasia, a benign condition. No mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer, so malignancy is indeed negative. Therefore, all three fields are determined: TURP, ei, NA.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
