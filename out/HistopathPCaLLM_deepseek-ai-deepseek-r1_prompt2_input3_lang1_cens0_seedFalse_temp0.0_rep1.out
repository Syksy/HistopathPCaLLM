Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text here is "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because TURP typically results in chip-like fragments. So the sample type here is likely "TURP". But I should check if there's any mention of biopsy or RP (radical prostatectomy). The text doesn't mention anything about a biopsy procedure or a radical prostatectomy, so TURP seems correct.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." which translates to "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So the answer here should be "ei" (no). The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since there's no malignancy detected, "ei" is appropriate.

For Gleason score, the rule is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which aligns with this conclusion.

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason in the text. The example given in the problem shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is required. But here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is automatically "NA". 

Putting it all together:
- Sampletype: TURP (because of the fragments/chips)
- Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found)
- Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)

I should double-check the sample type. The term "lastuja" is key here. TURP samples are often described as chips or fragments, whereas a biopsy would be needle cores, and RP would be the entire prostate. Since the sample is fragments, TURP is the correct classification. The example given in the problem also uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "biopsiasta", so the terminology is important. Here, "lastuja" points to TURP.
