Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text here is "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since that procedure often results in chip-like fragments. So Sampletype might be "TURP". But I should check if there's any other indication. The example given for biopsy used "biopsiasta", which is biopsy in Finnish. Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP explicitly. However, "lastuja" is commonly associated with TURP specimens. So I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." That translates to "Nothing directly indicating malignancy is seen." So Malignancy should be "ei" (no). 

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which aligns with the absence of malignancy. 

I need to make sure there's no mention of any cancer or Gleason in the text. The phrases here talk about chronic inflammation and stromal hyperplasia, but no malignancy. So all criteria point to "ei" for malignancy and "NA" for Gleason. 

Sampletype is a bit tricky. The example given for TURP wasn't provided, but "lastuja" is a key term. Let me confirm: TURP specimens are usually chips, while biopsies are needle cores. Since this mentions "lastuja" (chips), TURP is the correct sample type here. 

So the final JSON should be:
Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
