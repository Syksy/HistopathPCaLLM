Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments," which is commonly associated with TURP procedures. Biopsy samples are usually smaller and not described as chips. So Sampletype is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states, "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." That translates to "Nothing directly indicating malignancy is seen." So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the absence of malignancy. 

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported, but since there's no malignancy, there's no Gleason to report. Also, the structure shouldn't have nested elements. 

Double-checking the sample type: TURP is correct because the description matches post-TURP specimens, which are often fragmented. Biopsy would be needle cores, and RP is the entire prostate. The weight (12.3g) might be a bit high for TURP, but it's possible. The key term "lastuja" points to TURP.

Malignancy is clearly negative here. No need to consider Gleason. So the final JSON should have TURP, "ei", and NA for Gleason.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
