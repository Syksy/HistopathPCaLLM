Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja. Käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments", which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states: "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." This means "Nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen." So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. Therefore, Gleason is "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all fields should reflect that. Also, the JSON structure shouldn't have nested elements. The example provided uses flat keys, so the output should follow that format.

Double-checking the terms: "lastuja" is indeed typical for TURP. The malignancy is explicitly stated as absent. No Gleason score mentioned because there's no cancer detected. All seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
