Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3g lastuja." The word "lastuja" translates to "chips" or "fragments," which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because TURP specimens are often described as chips. Biopsy would be smaller pieces, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is the whole gland. So Sampletype here is probably TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text says "Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy." That translates to "Nothing directly indicating malignancy is seen." So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the absence of malignancy.

Let me double-check. The sample type: TURP because of the fragments. Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA. That fits the example where if malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. The example given in the problem also shows that when there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I think that's correct. No mention of biopsy or RP keywords, and the fragments suggest TURP. No malignancy, so Gleason NA.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
