Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The example given helps, so I need to follow that closely.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The key term here is "ajetaan yhdellä kerral." From the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP, NA), I need to figure out which one this corresponds to. "Ajetus" in Finnish medical terms often refers to TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), so Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text states that there's some inflammation but cautery artifacts prevent reliable examination. It concludes that no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Since there's no mention of malignancy (adenocarcinoma or other cancer terms), and the report says they can't confirm anything, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example where the sample was inconclusive used "NA" for malignancy. But here, the report says they can't make a conclusion due to artifacts, so maybe it's "NA" because they couldn't assess properly. Wait, but the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). If there's no malignancy found, even if inconclusive, maybe it's "ei". Hmm. The example where the sample was problematic used "NA" for all. In this case, the report says "mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää" (no conclusive findings), so maybe malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since they couldn't assess due to artifacts, maybe "NA" is appropriate here.

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no mention of cancer (malignancy is "NA"), Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is NA (because they couldn't determine due to artifacts), and Gleason is NA. Wait, but in the example given, when the sample was problematic, all fields were NA. But in this case, the sample type is known (TURP). The example with the problematic text had "NA" for sampletype because it wasn't a valid report. Here, the sample type is clear. So Sampletype should be "TURP", Malignancy "NA" (since they can't confirm), and Gleason "NA".
