Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given report mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan" here might refer to a procedure. I'm not entirely sure, but "ajetaan" could be related to TURP, which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed. Alternatively, since it's a primary sample, maybe it's a biopsy. Wait, but TURP is a specific surgical procedure. The phrase doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. The user might have to default to NA here because the sample type isn't clearly stated as any of the allowed values.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states that there's some inflammation but cautery artifacts prevent reliable examination. It concludes that no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Since they can't confirm malignancy due to artifacts, the malignancy field should be "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report doesn't mention any malignancy, but it's because the artifacts made assessment unreliable. So maybe "ei" if no malignancy was found, but the problem is that the artifacts might obscure the presence. The instructions say if there's no conclusive result, perhaps "NA" is better. The example given where the sample was inconclusive used "NA" for malignancy. So in this case, since they can't determine conclusively, malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of cancer (malignancy is NA), the Gleason should be "NA" as well. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei" or "NA", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype isn't clearly biopsy, RP, or TURP. The procedure mentioned is "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" which I'm not certain about. Maybe the sample type is NA. Malignancy is NA because the results are inconclusive. Gleason is NA accordingly.
