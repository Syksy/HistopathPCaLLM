Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The key term here is "ajetaan," which translates to "driven" or "pushed," but I'm not sure. Wait, "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" might refer to a procedure. However, the sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. The term "prostatamateriaalia" just means prostate material. Since there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, the sample type should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The report says there's some inflammation but cautery artifacts prevent reliable examination. It concludes that no conclusive findings can be made. Since there's no mention of malignancy (adenocarcinoma or other cancers) and the artifacts hinder assessment, the malignancy field should be NA, not "ei" (no) because they couldn't determine it conclusively.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be NA as well.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's inconclusive, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it.
