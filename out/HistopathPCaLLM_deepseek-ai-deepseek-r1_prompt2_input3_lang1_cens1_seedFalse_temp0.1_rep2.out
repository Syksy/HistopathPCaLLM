Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided report, the original text mentions "Primäärinäyte koostuu vähän yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia, joka ajetaan yhdellä kerral." The term "ajetaan" here might refer to a procedure. However, the common terms for sample types are biopsy, RP, or TURP. The Finnish word "ajetaan" could translate to "drilled" or "cored," which might indicate a biopsy. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, "prostatamateriaalia" is prostate material, and "ajetaan yhdellä kerral" could mean it's a single core or sample taken via a procedure. Since it's not explicitly stated as TURP or RP, maybe it's a biopsy. But the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta." Here, the term isn't used. Hmm. Maybe the sample type here is NA because it's not clearly stated. Wait, the user's example used "biopsy" when the text had "biopsiasta." In this case, the report doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. The primary sample is just prostate material. So maybe Sampletype is NA.

Next, malignancy. The text says "polttoartefaktat estävät näytemateriaalin luotettavan tarkastelun. Siispä mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää tästä ajosta." So there's inflammation but artifacts prevent reliable examination. Since they can't make a conclusive determination, malignancy would be NA. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. Since the report states that no conclusive findings can be made due to artifacts, malignancy is NA.

Gleason grade. Since malignancy is NA (meaning it's not confirmed as malignant), the Gleason should also be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason, if malignancy is not confirmed, it's NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is NA because the examination was inconclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no mention and malignancy isn't confirmed.
