Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "The shaving material weighs approx 8.9g, approx 5g set on eight casettes." The term "shaving material" might refer to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP often involves removing prostate tissue in shavings. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and the summary is "Benign prostate hyperplasia." Since there's no mention of malignancy and it's explicitly stated as benign, Malignancy should be "no".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". However, since the diagnosis here is benign, there's no Gleason score reported. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so all fields should reflect that. Also, the JSON shouldn't have nested structures. Let me double-check the original text to confirm there's no mention of any other sample types or malignant findings. The key terms here are "shaving material" pointing to TURP, "benign" indicating no malignancy, and no Gleason score mentioned because it's benign. Everything seems to align with the allowed values. So the final JSON should be as follows.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
