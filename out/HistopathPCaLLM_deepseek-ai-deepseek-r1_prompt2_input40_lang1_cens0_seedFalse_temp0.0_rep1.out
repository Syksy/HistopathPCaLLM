Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The input text mentions "höyläysmateriaali", which translates to "shaving material". The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. TURP is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate, often using a shaving technique. So "höyläysmateriaali" likely refers to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia", which means benign prostatic hyperplasia. Also, it says "Atypiaa tai invasiivista kasvavaa epiteelia ei näy" (no atypia or invasive growing epithelium). So malignancy is not present. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Here, it's "ei".

For Gleason score, since the sample is benign, the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any adenocarcinoma or Gleason grading, which aligns with the benign finding.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. The example given uses "kyllä" and "ei", so that's correct. The Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
