Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The key terms here are "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes). The sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't specify the procedure type, so I'll have to mark Sampletype as "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "ainakin hyperplasiaa eturauhasessa" (at least hyperplasia in the prostate) and "inflammaatiota" (inflammation), but also "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else). However, there's no clear mention of malignancy like "adenokarsinooma" or "carcinoma". Hyperplasia and inflammation are benign findings. The phrase "Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia" (requires further investigation) suggests uncertainty but doesn't confirm malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no), but wait, the user instructions say if there's any doubt, maybe? Wait, no. The question is whether malignant findings were present. Since the report doesn't state any malignancy definitively, only hyperplasia and possible other unspecified findings, which aren't confirmed as malignant. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or cancer, and malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA". The example given shows that if malignancy is "kyllä", then Gleason is reported, otherwise "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no malignant findings are confirmed, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
