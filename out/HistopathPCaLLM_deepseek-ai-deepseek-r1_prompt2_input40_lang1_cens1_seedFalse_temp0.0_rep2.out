Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "8.9g materiaalista tutkitaan noin 8 kasetillista." The mention of "materiaalista" (material) and "kasetillista" (cassettes) might suggest a biopsy, but I'm not sure. Wait, biopsies are usually small samples, while RP and TURP are larger. TURP is a procedure to remove tissue for benign enlargement, but the weight here is 8.9g. I recall that TURP specimens can vary, but sometimes biopsies are taken with multiple cassettes. However, the sample type isn't explicitly stated here. The text doesn't mention words like "biopsia" (biopsy), "prostatektomia" (prostatectomy), or "TURP". So maybe the sample type is NA because it's not specified.

Next, malignancy. The report mentions "ainakin hyperplasiaa eturauhasessa ja ...... inflammaatiota, mutta mahdollisesti jotain muutakin. Vaatii jatkotutkimuksia." Hyperplasia is benign, and inflammation (inflammaatio) is also non-malignant. The "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" (possibly something else) is vague and not confirmed. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer (adenokarsinooma) or malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no), but wait, the "mahdollisesti jotain muutakin" could be suspicious. However, the user instructions say to consider only confirmed findings. Since it's not confirmed and requires further testing, malignancy isn't confirmed. So "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, but mentions possible other things, but hyperplasia and inflammation are benign. So "ei" would be correct because there's no mention of malignancy found, only possible other things that need follow-up. So Malignancy: "ei".

Gleason grade. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. Since there's no malignancy detected (as per the previous answer), the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified, so NA. Malignancy is no. Gleason is NA.
