Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." So Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The report says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So Malignancy is "no". Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be NA. 

Wait, but the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. If there's no cancer, then the answer is no for malignancy. The example given for a benign statement has Gleason as NA. So in this case, Gleason is definitely NA. 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no mention of any tumor. The text clearly states no prostate cancer, so that's correct. No nested structures, just the three fields. Check if the example aligns. The second example had all NA because it was invalid, but here the statement is valid but benign. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
