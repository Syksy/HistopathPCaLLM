Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "systemaattisia biopsioita", which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista", meaning prostate cancer is not present. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. 

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason grades. The example given shows that if there's no cancer, Gleason is NA. The input doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's confirmed.

No nested structures allowed, just the three top-level fields. All values are correctly determined based on the provided text. No issues here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
