Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "systemaattisia biopsioita", which translates to systematic biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista", meaning no prostate cancer is present. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which makes sense if there's no cancer detected.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only include the worst lesion's results. Since there's no cancer, all fields except Sampletype and Malignancy (which is "ei") should be NA for Gleason. 

Double-checking the example provided: when malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. That fits here. The sample type is clearly biopsy. No other sample types like RP or TURP are mentioned. 

Everything seems to align. The answer should have Sampletype as biopsy, Malignancy as ei, and Gleason as NA.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
