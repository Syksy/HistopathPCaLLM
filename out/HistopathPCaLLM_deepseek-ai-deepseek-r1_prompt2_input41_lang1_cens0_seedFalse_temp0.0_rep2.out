Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate samples and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The sample input is a free-text report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason grade.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the text: "Näytteet 1-6 ovat edustavia systemaattisia biopsioita..." The key word here is "biopsioita", which is Finnish for biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista." That translates to "Prostate cancer does not appear in the material." So the malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy mentioned, the Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason scores. The text talks about chronic inflammation and atrophy but no cancer. So all three fields are clear. No nested structures, just straightforward values. The example provided also shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". That fits here.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
