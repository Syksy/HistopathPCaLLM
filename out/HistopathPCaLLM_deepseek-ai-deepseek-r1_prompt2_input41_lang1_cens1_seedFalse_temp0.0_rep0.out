Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields required are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: "Näytteet kerätty vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta eturauhasesta." The key word here is "kerätty" which means collected. The sample is taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate. The report doesn't mention a specific procedure like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states: "Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia." This translates to "It's hard to say if there are cancer-related changes in the sample." Since there's uncertainty and no clear evidence of malignancy, the answer here isn't a definitive yes or no. The instructions say to use NA if the information isn't clear. So, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since the malignancy is uncertain (NA), the Gleason score should also be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which supports this conclusion.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have NA for all fields because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is uncertain, and there's no Gleason score provided.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
