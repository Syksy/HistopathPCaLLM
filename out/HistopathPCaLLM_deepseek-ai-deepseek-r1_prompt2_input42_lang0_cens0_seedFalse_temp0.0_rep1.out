Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input statement starts with "Prostatectomy preparate..." I know that "prostatectomy" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "score 7 (4+3)". Gleason scores are associated with cancer, so malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The summary here is "score 7 (4+3)", which translates to 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The text mentions "almost exclusively seen Gleason grade 4" and a small amount of Gleason 3. The summary combines them as 4+3=7, which is the primary and secondary patterns. That's the correct format.

No nested structures allowed in the JSON, so just straightforward key-value pairs. Let me double-check each field:

Sampletype: "RP" (since prostatectomy is RP)
Malignancy: "yes" (presence of Gleason score indicates cancer)
Gleason: "4+3=7" (as per the summary provided)

Everything seems to fit. No ambiguous parts here. The example given in the problem uses a biopsy sample, but here it's a prostatectomy, so "RP" is correct. The answer should be valid JSON without any extra nesting.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}
```
