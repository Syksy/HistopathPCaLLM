Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, and I need to make sure I only take the most severe lesion into account.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g invastigated." The term "prostatectomy" here refers to RP, so the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "Summary: score 7 (4+3)." Since Gleason scores are indicative of cancer, the malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The summary here is "score 7 (4+3)", which translates to 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of a small amount of Gleason 3, the most severe lesion is the 4+3=7 as per the summary. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and only includes the most severe findings. The other mentions of Gleason 3 are less severe than the 4+3=7, so they're ignored. All fields are filled correctly without any NAs here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
