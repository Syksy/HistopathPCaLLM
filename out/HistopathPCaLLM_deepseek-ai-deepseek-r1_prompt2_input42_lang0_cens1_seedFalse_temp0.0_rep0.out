Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specific, so I need to parse the input carefully.

First, the original sample type. The input says "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "sample" is a bit vague, but common sample types are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't specify which one, just mentions "prostate sample." So maybe the sample type isn't clear here. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since it's not specified, I should go with NA.

Next, malignancy. The text states, "However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." So they can't confirm if it's cancer. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the presence of a malignant tumor isn't confirmed, the answer here should be "no" or "NA"? Wait, the options are "yes" if malignant, "no" if not, or "NA" if unclear. The statement says it can't be determined, so maybe "NA" is more appropriate here. But the example given in the problem where malignancy isn't clear uses "NA". For instance, the second example where the text is gibberish, malignancy is NA. In this case, since the text explicitly says they can't determine if it's cancer or inflammation, "NA" makes sense for Malignancy.

Third, Gleason grade. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, there's no Gleason reported. The example shows that if it's benign, Gleason is NA. So here, Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified beyond "prostate sample". Malignancy is NA because it's undetermined. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it and malignancy isn't confirmed. The JSON should reflect these values accordingly.
