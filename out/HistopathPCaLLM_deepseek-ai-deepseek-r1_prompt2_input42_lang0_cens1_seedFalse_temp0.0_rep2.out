Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The task is to determine three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to understand the input text. The provided statement is: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared. Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." 

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. The text mentions "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared." The term "sample" here is a bit vague. It doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of "prepared" might suggest a biopsy, but without explicit terms like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", it's safer to mark this as NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." Since the determination isn't possible, there's no clear indication of malignancy. So, Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the requirement is to report it in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy isn't confirmed here, the Gleason grade should be NA.

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no mention of any lesions. The text is inconclusive. Also, the example provided for an invalid statement uses NA for all fields when the text is unclear, which seems similar to this scenario. 

Double-checking for any possible keywords: terms like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP" are absent. The sample type isn't specified. The malignancy is undetermined, so no. Gleason isn't mentioned at all. Therefore, all three fields should be NA.
