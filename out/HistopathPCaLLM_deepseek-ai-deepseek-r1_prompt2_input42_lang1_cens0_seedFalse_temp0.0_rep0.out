Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Prostatektomiapreparaattia". I know "prostatektomia" means prostatectomy, so the sample type here is likely "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report talks about Gleason grades 4 and 3, which are indicators of cancer. So there are malignant findings. The allowed values here are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the example given uses "major+minor=sum". The text says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". That fits the format. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The example provided uses the highest grades mentioned, which here are 4 and 3. The summary confirms 4+3=7, so that's correct.

Double-checking the sample type: "Prostatektomiapreparaattia" definitely refers to a prostatectomy specimen, so RP is right. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of Gleason scores. Gleason is correctly formatted as per the example. All fields should be filled without any NA in this case.
