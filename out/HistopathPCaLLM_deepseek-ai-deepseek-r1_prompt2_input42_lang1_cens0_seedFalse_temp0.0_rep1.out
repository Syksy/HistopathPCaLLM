Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The input text here starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan n. 80g." The word "prostatektomiapreparaatti" refers to a prostatectomy specimen. In the examples given earlier, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So the sample type here should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text mentions "Gleason 4 asteen erilaistumista" and "Gleason 3". Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer, so the presence of these indicates malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since there are Gleason grades reported, the malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, the Gleason score. The example shows that it should be in the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". So the major is 4, minor is 3, sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, the highest Gleason is 4, and the sum is 7, which is correctly captured as 4+3=7. The sample type is clearly from a prostatectomy, so RP. Malignancy is confirmed by the presence of Gleason scores. All three fields are accounted for correctly.
