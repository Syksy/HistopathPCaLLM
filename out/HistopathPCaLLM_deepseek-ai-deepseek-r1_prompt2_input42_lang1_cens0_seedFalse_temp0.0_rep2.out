Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text starts with "Prostatektomiapreparaattia tutkitaan..." The word "prostatektomia" translates to prostatectomy, which is RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The presence of Gleason scores (4 and 3) indicates cancer. The report mentions "Gleason 4 asteen erilaistumista" and "Gleason 3", which are both cancer grades. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For the Gleason score, the example uses "major+minor=sum". The text says "pistesumma 7 (4+3)". Here, the primary pattern is 4 and secondary is 3, so it's 4+3=7. The correct format is "4+3=7".

I need to ensure there's no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The summary mentions 4+3=7, which is the highest sum here. All other details like the amount of each grade (pieni määrä) don't affect the worst case. 

So the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as yes, and Gleason as 4+3=7.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
