Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input text is: 

"Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?. Sekalaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta. Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota."

First, I need to determine the sample type. The sample is referred to as "prostatanäyte," which translates to prostate sample. The possible values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The term "näyte" is a general term for sample, but since it's not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, I might have to default to NA. However, sometimes "prostatanäyte" in context could imply a biopsy, but without more specific information like TURP or RP mentioned, it's safer to go with NA here.

Next, malignancy. The report states that they can't determine if it's cancer (syöpää) or inflammation (inflammaatiota). So the presence of malignancy is uncertain. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or NA. Since it's inconclusive, the answer here should be NA.

For Gleason score, since malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason should be NA. The rules say to report Gleason only if there's malignancy. Here, since it's uncertain, we leave it as NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is NA because it's undetermined. Gleason is NA because there's no confirmed malignancy.
