Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." The term "chippings" and the mention of cassettes make me think of TURP, as TURP often results in chippings from the resection. Biopsy samples are usually cores, not chippings. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." That clearly indicates no malignancy, so the answer here is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given for a benign statement also uses NA for Gleason.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no malignancy, that's straightforward.
