Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA.

Looking at the statement: "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar. Only ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material."

The term "prostate chippings" makes me think of TURP, as TURP often results in chippings or fragments of prostate tissue. Biopsy samples are usually cores or needle samples, and RP is the entire prostate. So sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, malignancy. The text explicitly states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma," so malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the answer is "NA" as per the instructions.

So the structured JSON should be:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. All fields check out.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
