Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." The term "prostate chippings" makes me think of TURP, since TURP typically involves removing prostate tissue in chips. Biopsy would usually mention cores or needles, and RP is the whole prostate. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Only ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma, the malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example given for a benign case also uses NA for Gleason.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure there's no nested structures and that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion at all. So the JSON should reflect these values accurately.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
