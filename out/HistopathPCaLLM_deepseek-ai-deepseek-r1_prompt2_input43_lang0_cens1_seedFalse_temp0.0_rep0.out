Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen..." The mention of "prostate samples" and "cassettes" makes me think this is a biopsy. Biopsy samples are often placed in cassettes for processing. But wait, sometimes TURP specimens can also be in cassettes. However, the sample size here is 30g. TURP usually removes more tissue, like 30-80g, while biopsies are smaller. But the exact type isn't specified. The user might consider "biopsy" if the context implies it, but since it's not explicitly stated, maybe NA is safer. But the example given in the instructions for a biopsy didn't have the word "biopsy" explicitly either. Wait, the example statement was "prostate biopsy" so they used that. Here, the statement says "prostate samples" but doesn't specify the procedure. So maybe Sampletype should be NA here because it's not clear if it's biopsy, RP, or TURP. The user instructions say to use the allowed values, and if not clear, NA. So Sampletype: NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says "Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." So they couldn't determine if there's cancer. So Malignancy should be "no"? Wait, no. If they can't reach a decision, does that mean it's negative, or inconclusive? The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the statement says "no decision... can be reached," maybe Malignancy is NA. Because it's not confirmed as yes or no. But the example given for an invalid statement had Malignancy as NA. Wait, in the example where the statement was a jumble, they used NA. Here, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user instructions say "Malignancy" is whether there were malignant findings. If the report says they can't decide, then it's not confirmed as yes or no. So maybe Malignancy is "no"? Or is it NA? The example given in the instructions for a valid statement that mentions adenocarcinoma uses "yes". Here, since they can't reach a decision, perhaps the answer is "no" because there's no confirmation of malignancy. But the text says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which is ambiguous. So maybe Malignancy is "NA" because it's not determined. But the allowed values don't have an "inconclusive" option. The options are yes, no, or NA. So if the report doesn't state malignancy, but also doesn't confirm it's absent, then maybe Malignancy is "no"? Wait, the example where the statement was invalid had Malignancy as NA. But in this case, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user instructions say "Malignancy" is "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report explicitly says "no malignancy found", then "no". If it's uncertain, maybe "NA". But the text here says "no decision... can be reached", which implies that malignancy isn't confirmed. So perhaps Malignancy is "no"? Or is it "NA"? I think the correct approach here is that if the report doesn't confirm malignancy, then Malignancy is "no". But if the report is uncertain, maybe "NA". Hmm. Let me check the example again. The first example had "adenocarcinoma detected", so "yes". The second example was a jumble, so "NA". Here, the report says they can't reach a decision. So it's not confirmed as yes, but also not confirmed as no. Therefore, Malignancy should be "NA" because the presence isn't confirmed. Wait, but the allowed values don't have an "inconclusive" option. So maybe "no" is not correct because they didn't find it, but they also couldn't rule it out. The user instructions say "Malignancy" is "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report doesn't state any malignant findings, then "no". But here, they couldn't decide. So perhaps "NA" is appropriate here because the information is not available or not determined. So Malignancy: NA.

Third, Gleason grade. The allowed values are "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since there's no mention of Gleason grades in the statement, and Malignancy is NA (or even if Malignancy were "no"), the Gleason would be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (since the procedure type isn't specified), Malignancy is NA (because the report is inconclusive), and Gleason is NA.
