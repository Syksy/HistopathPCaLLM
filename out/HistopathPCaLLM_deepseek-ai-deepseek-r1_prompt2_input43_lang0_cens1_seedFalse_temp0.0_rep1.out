Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not available. Looking at the provided statement: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." The first line mentions "prostate samples" and "material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." This seems like a general description of how the sample is handled but doesn't specify the procedure type. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So, the sample type here is not clear, so I should put "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." That means the pathologist couldn't determine if there's malignancy. Since it's uncertain, the Malignancy field should be "NA". If it had said "no malignant tumor found," then it would be "no," but here it's inconclusive.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since the malignancy is "NA" here (no confirmation of cancer), the Gleason grade should also be "NA". There's no mention of any Gleason scores in the statement either, which reinforces that.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't determined, and there's no Gleason grade reported.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
