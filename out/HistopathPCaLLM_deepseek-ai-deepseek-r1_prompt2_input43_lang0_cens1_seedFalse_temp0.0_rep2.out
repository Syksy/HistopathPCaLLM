Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are predefined, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I'll look at the sample statement provided: "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached."

Starting with the first field, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The statement mentions "prostate samples" and "material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." Typically, when samples are placed in cassettes, it's part of processing after a biopsy or surgery. However, the exact type isn't specified here. The term "prostate samples" is vague. Without more specific terms like "core biopsies" (which would indicate biopsy) or "prostatectomy" (indicating RP), or "TURP chips," I can't definitively determine the sample type. So, Sampletype should be "NA."

Next, Malignancy. The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." The key part here is that they couldn't determine if there's cancer. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since the report is inconclusive, it's not confirming malignancy (yes) nor definitively stating there's no malignancy (no). Therefore, Malignancy should be "NA."

Lastly, Gleason grade. The Gleason score is only reported if malignancy is confirmed. Since the malignancy is inconclusive here, there's no Gleason grade provided. So, Gleason should be "NA."

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't determined, and no Gleason score is mentioned. I need to ensure there's no nesting and only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no lesion reported. So the final answer should be all NAs.
