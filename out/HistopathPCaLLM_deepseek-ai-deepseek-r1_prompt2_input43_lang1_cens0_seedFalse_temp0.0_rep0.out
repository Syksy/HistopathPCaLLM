Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a JSON structure. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja." The word "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips or fragments, which is typical for a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. However, sometimes "prostatalastuja" can also refer to biopsy samples. Wait, but TURP samples are usually chips from the resection. The text also mentions "Materiaali ajettiin kaseteissa A-H, purkissa jäljellä noin 15g." Cassettes A-H suggest that the sample was processed in multiple cassettes, which is common in TURP or biopsy. But the term "prostatalastuja" is more commonly associated with TURP. However, I need to check if there's a more specific term. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the sample is "prostatalastuja", which might be TURP. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. TURP is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chips, so "prostatalastuja" would align with TURP. So Sampletype here should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text states "mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin." That translates to "nothing indicative of prostate adenocarcinoma is present in the material." So the malignancy is negative. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score: Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer found. So the Gleason field is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Let me cross-verify. The sample is prostate chips (TURP), no cancer found, so Gleason isn't applicable. Yes, that makes sense.
