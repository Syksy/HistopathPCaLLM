Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä noin 30g prostatalastuja." The word "prostatalastuja" translates to prostate chips, which are typically from a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "mitään eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan viittaavaa ei tule materiaalissa esiin," which means no signs of adenocarcinoma were found. So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions state to use "NA" for benign cases. So Gleason is "NA".

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, there's no malignancy, so all fields should be straightforward. The example provided helps confirm the format. Let me double-check each part to avoid mistakes. The sample type is definitely TURP, malignancy is no, and Gleason NA. That fits the required structure.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
