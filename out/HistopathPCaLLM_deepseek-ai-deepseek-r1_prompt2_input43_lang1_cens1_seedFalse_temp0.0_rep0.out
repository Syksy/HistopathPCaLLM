Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. The input is a free-text report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason score if applicable.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input: "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The term "prostatanäytteitä" translates to prostate samples. But there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. But wait, "näytteitä" is samples, which could be biopsy, but the example used "biopsy" when the word "biopsiasta" was present. Since this text doesn't specify the exact procedure, maybe it's "NA". But I need to check if there's any hint. The first example had "biopsiasta" leading to "biopsy". Here, "prostatanäytteitä" is more generic. So perhaps the sample type is "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia nähtävillä, ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista." Translating that: "Individual atrophic glands visible, cannot draw conclusions about cancer-related changes." So they didn't find evidence of malignancy. The malignancy field should be "ei" (no). Because there's no mention of cancer, just that they can't conclude it's related to cancer. Wait, but does "ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään" mean they can't confirm, so it's negative? Or is it uncertain? The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report states that there are no conclusions pointing to cancer-related changes, maybe malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer-related changes were found. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy.
