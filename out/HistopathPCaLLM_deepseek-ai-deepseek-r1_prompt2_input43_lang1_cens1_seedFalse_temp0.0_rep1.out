Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Noin 30g prostatanäytteitä. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille ja purkkiin." The term "prostatanäytteitä" translates to prostate samples. However, the sample types allowed are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The report doesn't specify the exact procedure like biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just says prostate samples, so I can't be sure. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "ei päästä johtopäätöksiä syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista," which means no conclusions can be drawn about cancer-related changes. It also mentions "Yksittäisiä atrofioituneita rauhasia" (some atrophic glands) but no signs of malignancy. So, Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer was found, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
