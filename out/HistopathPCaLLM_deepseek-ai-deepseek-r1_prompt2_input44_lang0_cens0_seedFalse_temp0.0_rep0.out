Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The input text mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." The key term here is "biopsies," which directly points to the sample type being "biopsy." So Sampletype should be "biopsy."

Next, determining if there are malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." The current report indicates no tumor tissue is present, so Malignancy should be "no." Even though previous biopsies had cancer, the current finding is negative.

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." However, since the current report states no tumor tissue is found, there's no Gleason grade to report. Therefore, Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions for benign statements.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the most severe lesion. Since the current findings are benign, the most severe is non-malignant. All fields should be filled accordingly without any nested structures. Let me double-check the allowed values: Sampletype is "biopsy," Malignancy is "no," and Gleason is "NA." That fits the criteria.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
