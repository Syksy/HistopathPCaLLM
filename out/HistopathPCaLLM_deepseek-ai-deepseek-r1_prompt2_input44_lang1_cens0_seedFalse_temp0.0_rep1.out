Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Edustavia prostatabiopsiota normaalimallin mukaan." The word "prostatabiopsiota" translates to prostate biopsy. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Ei mitään epäilyttävää." which means "Nothing suspicious." Also, it mentions that in previous biopsies there was prostate cancer ("AIemmissa biopsioissa kyllä löydetty prostatasyöpää"), but now there's no tumor tissue seen ("nyt ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta"). So currently, there's no malignancy detected. Therefore, Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy found in the current sample, the Gleason field should be "NA". The previous findings of cancer don't count here because we're only considering the current sample.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. In this case, since the current sample is benign, Gleason is NA. All fields should be filled based on the current report, not past ones. The example given in the problem shows that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. That fits here.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yes, "prostatabiopsiota" is biopsy, "ei mitään epäilyttävää" and no cancer now. All correct.
