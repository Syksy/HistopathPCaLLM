Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON format. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "Edustavia prostatabiopsiota normaalimallin mukaan." The word "prostatabiopsiota" translates to prostate biopsy. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Ei mitään epäilyttävää." which means "Nothing suspicious." Also, it mentions that in previous biopsies there was prostate cancer ("AIemmissa biopsioissa kyllä löydetty prostatasyöpää"), but now there's no tumor tissue seen ("nyt ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta"). So currently, there's no malignancy detected. Therefore, the malignancy field should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or sums. Since there's no malignancy found in the current sample, the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure that only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings, so Gleason isn't applicable. Also, the structure shouldn't be nested, so straightforward key-value pairs.

Double-checking the example provided: when there's malignancy, Gleason is in "major+minor=sum" format. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". Sample type is correctly identified as biopsy. All seems to fit the required structure.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
