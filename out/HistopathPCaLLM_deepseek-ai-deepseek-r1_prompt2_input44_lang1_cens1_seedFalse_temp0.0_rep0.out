Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the sample type needs to be determined. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was a biopsy, so I need to look for keywords indicating the sample type. The input text mentions "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The word "näytteitä" translates to samples, but there's no direct mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). However, the note at the end says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää," which refers to previous biopsies. But the current sample isn't explicitly stated as a biopsy. So maybe the sample type here is unclear, hence "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text states "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." That translates to "Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." So the current sample doesn't show malignancy. But wait, the note mentions previous biopsies reported cancer. However, the question is about the current sample. Since the current sample doesn't show malignancy, the answer should be "ei" (no). But wait, the user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion's results. If the current sample is benign but there's a history, does that matter? The example given in the problem shows that if the current sample is benign, malignancy is "ei" even if previous ones were malignant. So here, since the current sample doesn't show malignancy, it's "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The current report doesn't mention any Gleason grades. The previous biopsies did, but the current sample doesn't. Since the malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".
