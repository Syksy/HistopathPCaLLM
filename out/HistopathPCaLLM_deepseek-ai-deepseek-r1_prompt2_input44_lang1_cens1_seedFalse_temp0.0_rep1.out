Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the sample input to understand the requirements better.

First, the sample input given is: "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti. Mikroskoopilla nähdään normaalirakenteista eturauhaskudosta vaihtelevalla rauhaskoolla. Vähän kroonista inflammaatiota ja paikoitellen atrofiaa. Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään. Huom: Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää."

Translating this to English might help. It says something like "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine. Microscopically, normal prostate tissue structure with varying glandular size. Some chronic inflammation and focal atrophy. Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded. Note: Previous biopsies reported prostate cancer."

Now, let's break down each required field.

1. Sampletype: The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The text mentions "prostatanäytteitä" (prostate samples) taken "standardirutiinin mukaisesti" (according to standard routine). The note refers to previous biopsies, but the current sample is described as "edustavia prostatanäytteitä," which is a bit vague. However, since it's about taking samples and mentions previous biopsies, but the current sample type isn't explicitly stated. The term "näytteitä" translates to samples, which could imply biopsy, but the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text says "Prostata biopsiasta." Here, the current sample isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. So maybe Sampletype is NA here because it's not specified. Wait, but the example had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta." In this case, the current report doesn't explicitly state the sample type. The note refers to previous biopsies, but the current sample might be a different type. However, the first sentence says "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." If "standard routine" refers to a biopsy procedure, but it's not clear. Since the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe Sampletype should be NA. But I need to check if "prostatanäytteitä" in this context is considered a biopsy. In medical terms, "prostatanäyte" could be a biopsy sample, but without explicit mention, maybe it's safer to put NA. Alternatively, if "standardirutiinin mukaisesti" implies a routine biopsy, then maybe it's biopsy. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text said "Prostata biopsiasta," which is explicit. Here, the text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So perhaps Sampletype is NA.

2. Malignancy: The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." Which translates to "Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." So the current sample doesn't show malignancy, but the note mentions previous biopsies had cancer. However, the question is about the current sample. Since they can't determine malignancy here, does that mean "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are: if there are malignant findings, "kyllä", if not, "ei", else "NA". But in this case, the report says they can't conclude anything about malignant changes. So does that mean the presence of malignancy is uncertain, hence "NA"? Because the sample doesn't confirm malignancy, but also doesn't rule it out. The example given in the problem had a clear malignancy ("adenokarsinoomaa"), so "kyllä". Here, since it's inconclusive, maybe "NA" is appropriate. But wait, the third example in the problem had a nonsensical text, and all fields were NA. In this case, the current sample's malignancy is not determined, so maybe "ei" if no malignancy is found, but the text says they can't conclude. So perhaps "NA" is correct here.

3. Gleason: Should be in "major+minor=sum" format if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is inconclusive or not present, Gleason would be "NA". But the note mentions previous biopsies reported cancer, but the current sample's Gleason isn't mentioned. So the answer is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since the type isn't explicitly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: NA (because the report says they can't determine malignant changes)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy is found in the current sample)
