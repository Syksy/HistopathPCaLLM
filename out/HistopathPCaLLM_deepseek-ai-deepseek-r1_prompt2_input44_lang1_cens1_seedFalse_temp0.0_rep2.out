Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Edustavia prostatanäytteitä standardirutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytteitä" translates to prostate samples. However, the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned here. The note says "Aiemmissa biopsioissa raportoitiin eturauhassyöpää," which means "Previous biopsies reported prostate cancer." But the current sample isn't specified as a biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the sample type is unclear, hence "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text states, "Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään." This translates to "Regarding malignant changes, nothing can be concluded." So there's no evidence of malignancy in this sample. However, the note mentions previous biopsies had cancer, but the current sample doesn't show malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei" (no) because the current sample doesn't indicate malignancy.

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy found in this sample, the Gleason should be "NA". The previous biopsies had cancer, but the current report doesn't mention any Gleason score, so we don't include that here.

Wait, but the instruction says to consider only the worst lesion's results from the current sample. The current sample doesn't show malignancy, so Gleason is NA. Even though previous biopsies had cancer, the current sample's results are what matter here. So the malignancy is "ei" because the current sample doesn't have malignant findings. 

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA.
