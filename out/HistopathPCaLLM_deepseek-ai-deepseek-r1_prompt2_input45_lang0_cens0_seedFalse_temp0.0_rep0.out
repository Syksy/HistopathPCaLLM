Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." I know that a prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the prostate, and "whole" suggests it's a radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report talks about a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "Perineural invasion seen." Tumor focus and perineural invasion are indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy is "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "classes 3+4" in the context of gland structures. Wait, the exact phrase is "some build converging gland canals (classes 3+4)." Then later, "tissue gleason 3." Hmm, there's a bit of confusion here. The Gleason score is typically the sum of the two most prevalent grades. The mention of 3+4 would sum to 7, but there's also "tissue gleason 3." However, the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The 3+4=7 is a higher grade than just 3. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But wait, the way it's written in the text is "classes 3+4" which might be the major and minor grades. So major is 4, minor is 3, sum 7. The correct format is "4+3=7" or "3+4=7"? Wait, the Gleason score is written as the primary grade (most prevalent) plus the secondary grade (next most prevalent). So if it's 3+4, the primary is 3, secondary is 4, sum 7. But in the example given, the user used "4+3=7" when the text said "grades 4 and 3". So the order matters based on the primary and secondary. The text here says "classes 3+4", which would be primary 3, secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format would be "3+4=7". However, sometimes in reports, the higher grade is listed first if it's the major component. Wait, no, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. So if the classes are 3+4, that's primary 3, secondary 4. But in the example, the user had "4 and 3" leading to "4+3=7". So maybe the order in the text is important. The text here says "classes 3+4", so the primary is 3, secondary 4. So the Gleason should be "3+4=7". But the example given by the user had "4 and 3" leading to "4+3=7". So the order in the text is the order to follow. Therefore, here it's 3+4=7. However, there's another mention of "tissue gleason 3." But the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The 3+4=7 is more severe than just 3. So the correct Gleason is "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example in the instructions had "grades 4 and 3" leading to "4+3=7". So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. So in this case, "classes 3+4" would be primary 3, secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7". But the example in the user's instruction used "4+3=7" when the text said "grades 4 and 3". So maybe the order in the text is primary first. So in the current case, "3+4" would be 3+4=7. However, sometimes the higher grade is considered the primary if it's the major component, but the text here just says "classes 3+4". Without more context, we have to take the order as given. So the answer should be "3+4=7".

But wait, there's another mention of "tissue gleason 3". That might be a separate finding, but the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The 3+4=7 is more severe than just 3, so that's the one to report. So the Gleason field is "3+4=7".
