Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given statement starts with "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample..." So prostatectomy is the key here. Radical prostatectomy is often abbreviated as RP, so I think Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "fusing tumor tissue focus" and "Perineural invasion seen". Tumor focus and perineural invasion are indicators of malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The user wants it in the format "major+minor=sum". The text says "classes 3+4". In prostate pathology, Gleason grades are typically reported as the sum of the two most predominant patterns. Here, it's 3+4, which sums to 7. The correct format would be "3+4=7". The mention of "tissue gleason 3" might be confusing, but the main lesion's Gleason is 3+4 as per the converging gland canals part. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. The main tumor focus is the 3+4, which is the primary and secondary patterns. The other mention of gleason 3 might be a tertiary or less significant, but the instructions say to take the most severe, which is 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (from prostatectomy)
Malignancy: yes (tumor present)
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
