Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the sample type. The text mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." I know that "prostatectomy" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type here should be "RP."

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states there's a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "Perineural invasion seen." The presence of tumor tissue and invasion indicates malignancy. So Malignancy should be "yes."

Now, the Gleason grade. The relevant part is "some build converging gland canals (classes 3+4)." The Gleason grade is usually reported as major + minor = sum. Here, the major is 3 and minor is 4, so the sum is 7. However, the text also says "tissue gleason 3." Wait, that might be conflicting. But the instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The 3+4=7 is a higher grade than just 3. So the correct Gleason should be "3+4=7."

I need to make sure there's no higher grade mentioned. The rest of the text doesn't mention a higher sum. So the answer should be 3+4=7. Also, the example uses the format "4+3=7," so following that structure.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
