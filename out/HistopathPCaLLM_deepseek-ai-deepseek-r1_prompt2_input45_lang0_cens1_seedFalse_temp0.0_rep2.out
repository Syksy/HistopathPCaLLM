Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specific, so I need to be careful.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "A suspect prostate sample, processed according to the routine. Sample material from the middle (E, F, G)..." The term "sample" is mentioned, but it doesn't specify if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. The mention of "sample material" might suggest a biopsy, but without explicit terms like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", I can't be certain. So maybe Sampletype is NA here.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says "suspect prostate sample" but later states "Negative marginals, capsule intact. No metastases seen..." However, the key part is "the structure is unclear and not able to detect. Further inspection is needed." There's no clear mention of malignant tumor findings. The initial part mentions "suspect," but that's not a confirmation. Since there's no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy, Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? Wait, the example given for a non-valid statement uses NA for all. But in this case, the statement is a valid histopathological report but doesn't confirm malignancy. The user instructions say to use "yes", "no", or "NA". If the report doesn't state presence or absence clearly, maybe "no" if it's negative. Let me check the text again. It says "Negative marginals, capsule intact. No metastases seen..." So maybe the malignancy is "no"? But the initial part says "suspect" which might imply uncertainty. However, the example given in the problem where the statement is invalid uses NA. But this seems like a valid report. Wait, the user says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." If there's no mention of malignancy, but the report says "No metastases" and "Negative marginals," does that imply "no" for malignancy? Or is the absence of explicit mention leading to NA? Hmm. The example where malignancy is "no" would be if the report explicitly states no malignancy. Here, it's more about margins and metastases, but not directly stating presence or absence of malignant tumor. So maybe Malignancy is "NA" because it's unclear. Wait, the user's example for a valid statement with malignancy "yes" had "Adenocarcinoma is detected". Here, there's no such mention. The report is inconclusive: "structure is unclear and not able to detect. Further inspection is needed." So maybe Malignancy is "NA" because it's not confirmed. But the presence of "No metastases" and "Negative marginals" might suggest no malignancy. But I'm not sure. The key is whether the report explicitly states the presence or absence. Since it's unclear, maybe Malignancy is "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The example uses "4+3=7" for a malignant case. Here, since there's no mention of Gleason grades, and if Malignancy is "no" or "NA", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, so "NA". Malignancy is not clearly stated, so "NA". Gleason is "NA". So the JSON would be all NAs. But wait, the sample mentions "sample material from the middle (E, F, G)" which might be biopsy cores. Biopsy samples are often taken from different regions labeled by letters. So maybe Sampletype is "biopsy"? But the problem says allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. If the text mentions "prostate sample" and "sample material from the middle (E, F, G)", which are typical biopsy core labels, then Sampletype might be "biopsy". But the user instructions say to use the allowed values. If the text doesn't explicitly state "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", then it's NA. However, in medical contexts, when they refer to cores labeled by letters (like E, F, G), that's typically a biopsy. So maybe Sampletype is "biopsy". But the user's example uses "biopsy" when the text explicitly says "prostate biopsy". Here, it's "prostate sample" and "sample material from the middle (E, F, G)". So maybe it's a biopsy. But the user might consider only explicit mentions. This is a bit ambiguous. If I have to choose between "biopsy" or NA, but the text doesn't explicitly say "biopsy", then NA. But in practice, those labels (E, F, G) are biopsy cores. So perhaps Sampletype is "biopsy".

But the user's instructions are strict. Let me check the example again. The example statement says "prostate biopsy" and the Sampletype is "biopsy". If the current text doesn't have the word "biopsy", but refers to sample material from cores, maybe it's still considered a biopsy. However, the allowed values are strict. If the text doesn't use the exact terms, maybe it's NA. But maybe "sample" in this context implies biopsy. Hmm. This is a tough call. The user's example uses "biopsy" when the term is present. Here, the term is not present. So perhaps Sampletype is NA.

Malignancy: The text says "suspect" but no confirmation. "No metastases" and "Negative marginals" might suggest no spread, but the primary tumor isn't clearly mentioned. The structure is unclear, so they can't detect. So Malignancy is NA.

Gleason: Not mentioned, so NA.

So the final JSON would be all NAs. But let me double-check. The Sampletype: if the sample is from a biopsy, even if not explicitly stated, but the cores are labeled as E, F, G (common in biopsies), maybe it's a biopsy. But the user might require explicit terms. Since the example uses "biopsy" when the term is present, here it's not, so Sampletype is NA.

Therefore, the structured data would be:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
