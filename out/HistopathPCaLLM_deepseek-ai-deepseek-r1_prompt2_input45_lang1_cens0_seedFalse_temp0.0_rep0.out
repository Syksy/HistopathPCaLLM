Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti..." which translates to "The sample is a complete prostatectomy specimen..." So prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor tissue focus. Also, there's a Gleason score mentioned, which is indicative of cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text says "luokat 3+4". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, 3 is the major and 4 the minor, so sum is 7. But wait, the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order is major then minor. In the current case, it's "3+4", which would be major 3 and minor 4, sum 7. However, in Gleason grading, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, no—Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the highest remaining pattern (minor). Wait, actually, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the most predominant pattern plus the highest grade present, but the sum is the two added. However, in the example provided by the user, "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7, so the order in the text is first and second, regardless of which is higher. Wait, but in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", and the JSON is "4+3=7". So the first number is the primary grade, the second is the secondary, regardless of which is higher. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3 and secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example had "4 ja 3" leading to "4+3=7". In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which is written as 3+4. So the JSON should be "3+4=7".

But I need to check if there's any mention of Gleason in the text. The user's example uses "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. In the current case, the text says "kudoksen gleason 3". Wait, that's a different part. Let me re-read the text.

Original text: "Fokuksessa suurin osa rauhasista erillisia, mutta osa rakentaa yhteneviä rauhaskanavia (luokat 3+4). Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3."

Wait, so in the focus, the majority are separate glands, but some form fused glands (grades 3+4). Then, perineural invasion, tissue's Gleason 3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. The part in parentheses says "luokat 3+4", which would be the Gleason grades. Then later mentions "kudoksen gleason 3". Maybe there's a typo or confusion here. But according to the structure, the main Gleason score is the one given in the parentheses as 3+4. The mention of "gleason 3" later might refer to a different area, but the instructions say to take the worst lesion. So the worst would be 3+4=7. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but the example given by the user had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is primary then secondary. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3 and secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But I need to confirm if the sum is correct. 3+4 is 7, yes. So the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is RP (radical prostatectomy), Malignancy is yes, Gleason is 3+4=7.
