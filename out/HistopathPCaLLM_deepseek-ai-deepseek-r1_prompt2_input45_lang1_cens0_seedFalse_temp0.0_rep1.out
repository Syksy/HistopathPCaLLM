Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given text starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti..." which translates to "The sample is a complete prostatectomy specimen..." So prostatektomiapreparaatti refers to a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a tumor tissue focus. Also, there's a Gleason score mentioned, which is indicative of cancer. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text says "luokat 3+4". The format required is "major+minor=sum". Here, 3 is the major and 4 the minor, so sum is 7. But wait, the example given in the instructions uses "4+3=7" when the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3". So the order is major then minor. In the current case, it's "3+4", which would be major 3 and minor 4, sum 7. However, in Gleason grading, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, no—Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (major) and the highest remaining pattern (minor). Wait, actually, the current Gleason grading system (Grade Groups) uses the most predominant pattern plus the highest grade present, but the sum is the two added. However, in the example provided by the user, "4 ja 3" becomes 4+3=7, so the order in the text is first and second, regardless of which is higher. Wait, but in the example, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", which translates to "Gleason grades 4 and 3", and the JSON is "4+3=7". So the first number is the primary grade, the second is the secondary, regardless of which is higher. So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be primary 3 and secondary 4, sum 7. So the correct format is "3+4=7".

But wait, the user's example has "4 ja 3" leading to "4+3=7". So the order in the text is primary followed by secondary. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which is written as 3+4, so the JSON should be "3+4=7".

But I need to confirm. The example given by the user: the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which is "grades 4 and 3", and the JSON is "4+3=7". So the order in the text is primary then secondary. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which is written as 3+4, so primary 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but in the example, the user's example has "4 ja 3" (and) leading to 4+3. So the order in the text is the first mentioned as primary. So in the current case, "3+4" would be primary 3, secondary 4. So the sum is 7, so "3+4=7".

But I need to check if the text actually mentions the primary and secondary correctly. The phrase here is "luokat 3+4", which in Finnish would mean "grades 3+4", so the primary is 3 and secondary is 4. Therefore, the correct sum is 3+4=7. So the Gleason value should be "3+4=7".

But wait, in some contexts, the higher grade is listed first. Wait, no. The Gleason score is determined by the most common grade (primary) and the highest remaining grade (secondary). For example, if the majority is grade 3, and the next most common is grade 4, then it's 3+4=7. If the majority is 4 and the next is 3, it's 4+3=7. So the order matters. The example given in the user's prompt has "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, which aligns with primary 4 and secondary 3. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which is written as 3+4, so primary 3, secondary 4. Therefore, the sum is 7. So the correct entry is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype is "RP" (radical prostatectomy).

Malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a tumor focus and Gleason score.

Gleason is "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there are no other Gleason scores mentioned. The text also mentions "kudoksen gleason 3" but that's in the context of perineural invasion. Wait, the line says "Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3." So perineural invasion, tissue Gleason 3. But earlier, the main tumor focus has Gleason 3+4. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. So the main tumor is 3+4=7, which is worse than Gleason 3. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7.

Therefore, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
