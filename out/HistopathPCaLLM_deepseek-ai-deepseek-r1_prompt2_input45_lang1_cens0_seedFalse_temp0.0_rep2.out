Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text starts with "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti (paino 70g), prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The key term here is "prostatektomiapreparaatti", which translates to prostatectomy specimen. "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "kasvainkudoksen fokus" which means a focus of tumor tissue. Also, there's a Gleason score mentioned: "luokat 3+4". Since Gleason scores are indicative of cancer, this confirms malignancy. So the answer here is "kyllä".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The text says "luokat 3+4". The major pattern is 4 and minor is 3, so the sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7". Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "4+3=7" because the major is the higher grade. Wait, no, in Gleason scoring, the major (primary) pattern is the one with the higher grade. Wait, no, actually, the primary pattern is the most common, and the secondary is the next most common. But in the current Gleason grading system, the primary is the higher grade. Wait, no, that's not correct. The primary pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary is the second most prevalent. However, if there are two patterns, the higher grade is listed first if they are different. Wait, I need to clarify this. For example, if the majority is grade 3 and the next is grade 4, the Gleason score is 3+4=7. But in the example given in the problem statement, the user had "4+3=7" as the correct format. Wait, the example given was "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which translates to grades 4 and 3, so sum 4+3=7. But according to Gleason scoring, the primary grade is the most common, and the secondary is the next. However, in practice, if there are two grades, the higher one is listed first if they are different. Wait, no, that's not correct. The primary is the most extensive pattern, and the secondary is the next. So if the majority is 3 and the next is 4, it's 3+4=7. But in the example, the user had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So perhaps in the context of the problem, the order is as written in the text. The example given in the problem statement has "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" leading to "4+3=7". So in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4". So the order is 3 and then 4. But according to the example, the order in the text is taken as major and minor. Wait, the example's text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which is written as 4 and 3, so the major is 4, minor 3. In the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", so the major is 3 and minor 4? But that would be 3+4=7. However, in modern Gleason grading, the primary is the higher grade if there are two patterns. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, but if there are two patterns, the higher grade is considered the primary even if it's less extensive. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me check. According to current guidelines, the Gleason score is determined by the most common pattern (primary) and the second most common (secondary). However, if the highest grade is present, even if it's less than 5%, it's included. But in cases where there are two grades, the primary is the most common, and the secondary is the next. However, in the example given by the user, the text says "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3" which is written as 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as major + minor. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", which would be 3+4=7. But according to the example, the order in the text is directly used. So the answer here should be "3+4=7". However, I need to confirm if the user expects the major to be the higher grade. Wait, in the example, the text says "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is correct because the major is the higher grade. But in the current case, the text says "3+4", which would imply primary 3 and secondary 4, but according to current practice, if there's a higher grade present, even if it's less than the primary, the higher grade is considered the major. Wait, no, that's not correct. The primary is the most common pattern. The secondary is the next most common. The sum is primary + secondary. However, in some cases, if a higher grade is present but not the most common, it's still the secondary. For example, if the majority is 3 and there's some 4, it's 3+4=7. If the majority is 4 and some 3, it's 4+3=7. So the order in the text here is "3+4", which would mean primary 3 and secondary 4, leading to 3+4=7. However, in the example given by the user, the text had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7. So the order in the text is taken as written. Therefore, in the current case, the text says "luokat 3+4", so the answer should be "3+4=7". But wait, in the example, the user's example had "4 ja 3" leading to 4+3=7, which is correct. So the order in the text is directly used. Therefore, in this case, the text says "3+4", so the Gleason is "3+4=7". However, I need to check if the user expects the higher grade to be the major. For example, if the text says "3+4", but the higher grade is 4, should the major be 4? But according to the example, the order in the text is followed. So if the text says "4 and 3", it's 4+3. If the text says "3+4", it's 3+4. Therefore, in this case, the answer is "3+4=7". But wait, in reality, the Gleason score is determined by the primary (most extensive) and secondary (next most extensive) patterns. So if the text says "3+4", that's primary 3 and secondary 4. But in modern practice, if there's any pattern 4 or 5, the score is adjusted. However, the problem here is to take the values as reported in the text. The example given by the user took the order as written. Therefore, in this case, the text says "3+4", so the answer is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype is "RP" because it's a prostatectomy specimen.

Malignancy is "kyllä" because there's a tumor focus and Gleason score.

Gleason is "3+4=7" as per the text.

So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

I need to make sure there are no other Gleason scores mentioned. The text also mentions "kudoksen gleason 3" but that's in the context of perineural invasion: "Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3." So that's referring to the perineural invasion having Gleason 3. But the main tumor focus has 3+4. The problem states to take the worst lesion's results. So the main tumor is 3+4=7, which is the highest. The perineural invasion's Gleason 3 is part of the same tumor, but the main score is 3+4. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7.
