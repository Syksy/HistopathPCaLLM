Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of a prostate sample. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Suspekti prostatanäyte, prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample, but it's not specific. The report mentions "Negatiiviset marginaalit, kapseli ehjä" which might suggest a surgical specimen, but there's no clear mention of RP or TURP. The sample is labeled as "suspekti" (suspect), but without a clear indication of the procedure type. So Sampletype is probably NA.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa" (no metastases in lymph nodes) but doesn't explicitly mention malignancy in the sample. However, the main focus is on a suspicious area. The description of the focus is unclear: "Kuitenkin rakenne epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen. Tarkempaa tarkastelua vaaditaan." This suggests that malignancy isn't confirmed, and the findings are inconclusive. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy but mentions it's unclear, maybe NA is more appropriate. But the user instructions say to use "kyllä" or "ei" only if there's a clear indication. Since there's no mention of cancer (adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, etc.), and the sample is just suspicious but inconclusive, Malignancy should be "ei" or NA. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had "kyllä" when adenocarcinoma was mentioned. Here, there's no such mention. So probably "ei" isn't correct either. Wait, the user's example for an unclear report used "NA" for malignancy. Since this case is also unclear, maybe Malignancy should be NA. But the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state any malignancy, but it's suspicious, does that count as "ei" or NA? The example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. Here, the text is coherent but inconclusive. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, so maybe "ei" is correct. But the user might consider that if it's unclear, it's NA. I need to check the examples again. In the first example, when adenocarcinoma was present, it was "kyllä". In the second example, which was a jumbled text, all were NA. Here, the report is structured but doesn't confirm malignancy. The sample is suspicious, but the findings are unclear. Since there's no explicit mention of malignancy (like cancer cells), and the conclusion is that further examination is needed, the malignancy status isn't confirmed. So according to the user's instructions, if there's no clear malignant findings, it should be "ei". But maybe in this case, since it's suspicious but inconclusive, it's better to mark as NA. Wait, the user's instructions for the malignancy field: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. Here, the text is meaningful but doesn't confirm malignancy. So if there's no mention of malignancy, but the sample is suspect, but the report doesn't state it, then "ei" would mean no malignancy found. However, the report says "rakenne epäselvä" (structure unclear) and requires further examination, which might mean that malignancy can't be ruled out. But according to the user's rules, only if there are malignant findings, it's "kyllä". If no findings, "ei". If unclear, maybe "ei" isn't correct. But the user's examples don't cover this. The example with "kyllä" had adenocarcinoma. Here, there's no such term. So perhaps "ei" is correct. But the user might expect NA here. Hmm. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original Finnish text again. The report mentions "Suspekti prostatanäyte" (suspicious prostate sample), but the findings are "rakenne epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen" (structure unclear and difficult to interpret). So no definite malignancy is reported, but it's suspicious. Since the malignancy field is for whether malignant findings were present, and in this case, they can't confirm it, the answer should be "ei" (no) because there's no explicit mention of malignancy. Alternatively, since it's suspicious, maybe NA. But according to the user's instructions, "NA" is allowed. However, the example where malignancy was NA was when the text was nonsensical. Here, the text is meaningful but inconclusive. The user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there are no malignant findings, then "ei". If the presence is uncertain, maybe NA. But the user's allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't state any malignancy, but it's unclear, perhaps NA is more appropriate. But I'm not sure. Let's think again. The example given by the user for a nonsensical text had all NAs. Here, the text is meaningful but doesn't confirm malignancy. So if the report doesn't state any malignancy, then "ei". But if the report is unclear, maybe NA. The user's instructions for malignancy: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the answer is not found, then NA. But in this case, the answer is that no malignancy was found, but the sample is suspicious. Wait, the report says "Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa" (no metastases in lymph nodes), but that's about metastases, not the primary tumor. The main sample's findings are unclear. So the primary sample's malignancy isn't confirmed. Therefore, the answer for malignancy should be "ei" if no malignancy is found, but if the report is inconclusive, maybe NA. But according to the user's examples, when adenocarcinoma is present, it's "kyllä". When the text is gibberish, it's NA. Here, the text is clear but doesn't confirm malignancy, so perhaps "ei". But the sample is labeled as "suspekti", which might imply suspicion of malignancy. However, the user's instructions don't mention handling suspicion, only confirmed findings. So if there's no confirmed malignancy, it's "ei". But maybe in this case, since it's unclear, it's NA. This is a bit tricky. I'll have to make a judgment call here. Since the report doesn't explicitly state malignancy, and the findings are inconclusive, perhaps the malignancy field should be "ei" because there's no confirmation. Alternatively, if the suspicion is high enough, but the user's instructions don't account for that, maybe NA. But according to the user's examples, only when the text is nonsensical, it's NA. Here, the text is meaningful but doesn't confirm malignancy, so "ei" might be correct. 

Third, Gleason score. The report doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. The example had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3", but here there's no such mention. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: NA (since it's just "prostatanäyte" without specifying biopsy, RP, or TURP)
Malignancy: "ei" (since no malignancy is confirmed, but the sample is suspicious) or NA. But according to the user's example, if the text is unclear, use NA. However, in this case, the text is clear but inconclusive. The user's instructions say to return "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If the sample is suspicious but no malignancy is found, then "ei". If the presence is uncertain, maybe NA. But the example with unclear text used NA. Here, the text is clear but the findings are inconclusive. The user's instructions don't specify this scenario, but since there's no mention of malignancy, "ei" might be safer. However, the example where malignancy was NA was when the text was gibberish. Here, the text is meaningful but doesn't state malignancy, so "ei" is appropriate. 

Wait, but the user's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't mention any malignant findings, then "ei". The fact that it's suspicious doesn't necessarily mean there are malignant findings. So "ei" would be correct. 

So final answer:

Sampletype: NA (no specific type mentioned)
Malignancy: "ei" (no malignant findings reported)
Gleason: "NA" (no Gleason mentioned)
