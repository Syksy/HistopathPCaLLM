Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Suspekti prostatanäyte, prosessoitu rutiinin mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäyte" translates to prostate sample. The report mentions "Negatiiviset marginaalit, kapseli ehjä. Ei metastaaseja alueen imusolmukkeissa." This might suggest a radical prostatectomy (RP) since they're checking margins and lymph nodes, but the sample is referred to as "näyte" (sample) and there's no explicit mention of RP or TURP. However, the mention of "marginaalit" and "kapseli" could be part of a surgical specimen, but without clear terms like "radikaaliprostatektomia" (radical prostatectomy) or "TURP", it's ambiguous. The initial part says "Suspekti prostatanäyte" which is a suspected prostate sample, possibly a biopsy. But the text isn't clear enough. So maybe "NA" here.

Second, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that the structure is unclear and difficult to interpret, requiring further examination. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The focus is on a suspicious sample but no definitive diagnosis. So malignancy would be "ei" if benign, but since it's unclear, maybe "NA". Wait, the question is whether there were malignant findings. If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, even if suspicious, the answer should be "ei" only if benign. But since it's "epäselvä" (unclear) and requires further examination, maybe "NA" is safer. But the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". If there's no mention of malignancy, but it's suspicious, perhaps "NA" is appropriate here as the presence isn't confirmed.

Third, Gleason score. The report doesn't mention Gleason grades or scores. So it's "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is unclear, so "NA". Malignancy isn't confirmed, so "NA". Gleason not mentioned, so "NA".
