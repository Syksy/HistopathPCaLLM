Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Shaved prostate chippings with total tissue weight around 20 gr." The term "shaved prostate chippings" doesn't directly match the allowed values. Biopsy, RP, and TURP are specific procedures. "Shaved" might refer to a type of surgical sample, but since it's not one of the allowed options, I should go with NA here.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So the answer here is clearly "no" for Malignancy. Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade would automatically be NA, as per the instructions. 

For the Gleason grade, the example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". However, since the report states no cancer, there's no Gleason grade reported. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because "shaved prostate chippings" isn't one of the allowed categories. Malignancy is "no" because cancer wasn't found. Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy. I need to make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't have any nested structures. Let me double-check the example provided. The invalid example had all NAs, but here Malignancy is "no". That's correct because the example with no cancer would have "no" for Malignancy and NA for the others. Yep, that matches. Alright, ready to structure the JSON.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
