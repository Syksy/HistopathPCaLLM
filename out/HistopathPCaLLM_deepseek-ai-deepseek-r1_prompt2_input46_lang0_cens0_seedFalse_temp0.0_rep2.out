Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Shaved prostate chippings with total tissue weight around 20 gr." The term "shaved prostate chippings" doesn't directly match the allowed values. Biopsy is a sample taken via a needle, RP is surgical removal, and TURP is a procedure to remove tissue for benign enlargement. "Shaved" might refer to TURP, but I'm not entirely sure. However, since the options are limited, and TURP is a possible sample type for chippings, maybe that's the right choice. But wait, sometimes TURP is for benign cases, but the sample type is about how it was taken, not the diagnosis. Alternatively, if "shaved" isn't matching any of the allowed terms, maybe it's safer to put NA. Hmm, but the example given in the problem statement had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "prostate biopsy". Here, "shaved prostate chippings" might be from a TURP procedure. So I'll go with TURP for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The statement says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that benign statements have Gleason as NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check. The sample mentions "shaved prostate chippings" which is typically from TURP. Yes, TURP is correct. Malignancy is clearly stated as no. Gleason isn't applicable here. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
