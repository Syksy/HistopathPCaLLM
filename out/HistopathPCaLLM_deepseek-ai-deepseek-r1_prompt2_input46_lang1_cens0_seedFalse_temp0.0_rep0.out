Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not mentioned. The given text starts with "Höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaalin..." which translates to "The total weight of the shaved prostate chips tissue is about 20 gr." The term "höylättyjen" refers to shaved, which makes me think of TURP, as TURP involves shaving off pieces of the prostate. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." which means "No prostate cancer was found in the material." So Malignancy is "ei".

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score should be "NA" as per the instructions. Even if there were mentions of Gleason in the text, if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is automatically "NA". In this case, there's no mention of Gleason anyway.

Let me double-check each part. The sample type: TURP because of the mention of shaved chips. Malignancy: no cancer found. Gleason: NA. All seems to fit. The example provided in the problem also shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. So the JSON should be:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

I think that's correct. No red flags here. The key terms all point to the right categories.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
