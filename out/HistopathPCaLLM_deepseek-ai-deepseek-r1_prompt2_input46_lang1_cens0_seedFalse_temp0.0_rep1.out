Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaalin..." The term "höylättyjen" translates to "shaved" or "planed," which makes me think of TURP. TURP is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate, often using a shaving technique. So I'm leaning towards TURP for the sample type. But I should check if there's any other term that might indicate biopsy or RP. The text mentions "lastujen" which are chips or fragments, typical in TURP specimens. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." That translates to "No prostate cancer was found in the material." So the malignancy is "ei" (no). That's straightforward.

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which makes sense because there's no cancer found. So no need to look for numbers here.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is ei, and Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the original text to make sure I didn't miss anything. The keywords are "höylättyjen" (TURP), "ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää" (no malignancy), and no mention of Gleason. Yep, that seems right. The example provided in the problem also uses NA for Gleason when there's no malignancy. So the JSON should reflect these values.

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
