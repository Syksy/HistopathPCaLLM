Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "Höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaalin..." The term "höylättyjen" translates to "shaved" or "planed," which makes me think of TURP. TURP is a procedure where tissue is shaved off, so I'm leaning towards TURP for the sample type. The text doesn't mention biopsy or RP, so TURP seems right here.

Next, malignancy. The report states "Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista." That translates to "No prostate cancer was found in the material." So the malignancy should be "ei" (no). That's straightforward.

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades because there's no cancer detected. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure follows the example, with the exact keys and allowed values. No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Höylättyjen" definitely refers to a shaving procedure, which aligns with TURP. The absence of cancer is clear, so malignancy is correctly "ei". And no Gleason reported because there's no cancer. All set.
