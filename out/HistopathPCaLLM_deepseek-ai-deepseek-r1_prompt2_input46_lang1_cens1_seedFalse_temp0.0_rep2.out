Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The given text starts with "Eturauhasmateriaalin yhteiskoko noin 2x. Materiaali asetettu kaseteille, pienempi osa materiaalista ajettiin." The term "materiaali" here refers to the sample. The mention of "asetettu kaseteille" (placed in cassettes) and "ajettiin" (processed) might be part of routine lab handling. However, there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text doesn't specify the procedure type, so I think the sample type should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states, "Ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei." This translates to "It could not be determined whether there are changes related to cancer or not." Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain and not confirmed, the answer here isn't clearly "kyllä" (yes) or "ei" (no). The correct value would be "NA" because the report explicitly says it couldn't be determined.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy wasn't confirmed and the report couldn't determine cancer-related changes, there's no Gleason score provided. Therefore, this field should be "NA".

Putting it all together, all three fields would be "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is undetermined, and no Gleason score is present. I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included, but in this case, there's no malignancy reported, so all fields remain "NA".
