Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The rules are to take the most severe lesion's results and avoid nested structures.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left." The key word here is "biopsies," so Sampletype should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "No malign findings on the left or the right." "Malign" here is short for malignant, so the answer here is "no". So Malignancy is "no".

For Gleason grade, since there's no malignancy, the allowed value is "NA". The text does mention "3+4=7 cm," but that's about the length of the biopsies, not the Gleason score. Gleason grades are related to cancer cells' patterns, which aren't present here because there's no malignancy. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have "biopsy" for Sampletype, "no" for Malignancy, and "NA" for Gleason. I need to make sure there's no nesting and that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there are no malignant findings, the most severe is non-existent, hence the "NA" for Gleason. Double-checking the example given for a benign case confirms that structure.
