Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70..." The statement mentions "sample material" but doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) aren't present. So the sample type isn't clear here. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." Since it's uncertain, and there's no explicit mention of malignant tumor findings, the Malignancy field should be "NA". Even though there's mention of chronic inflammation, that's not malignancy. The key here is the uncertainty expressed in the report.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The preferred format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy couldn't be determined, there's no Gleason score provided. The numbers 30+40=70 refer to the amount of prostatic material, not Gleason grades. So Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together, all three fields will be "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is undetermined, and there's no Gleason score mentioned in the context of a tumor.
