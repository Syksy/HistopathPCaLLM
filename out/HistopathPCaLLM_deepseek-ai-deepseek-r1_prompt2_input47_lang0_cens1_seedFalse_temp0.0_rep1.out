Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological report related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I follow those strictly.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70." The mention of "sample material" from both sides and the total prostatic material makes me think this might be a TURP sample, as TURP often involves removing parts of the prostate, and the numbers could represent grams, which is common in TURP reports. But the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the sample mentions "prostate biopsy," so here, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The user might be referring to the sample type as NA because it's not clearly stated. Wait, but sometimes in reports, the sample type is inferred. For example, if it's a TURP, they might mention the weight. The total here is 70 grams, which is quite high for a biopsy (biopsies are small samples), and RP would be the entire prostate, which can vary but 70 grams is possible. However, TURP usually removes smaller amounts, but sometimes larger. Hmm. The problem is that the sample doesn't explicitly state the type. So maybe the correct answer here is NA because it's not specified. The example given in the problem where the sample type was "biopsy" was because the statement explicitly mentioned "prostate biopsy." Here, there's no such mention, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." So the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. The user instructions say to return "NA" if it's not determinable. So Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the allowed values are in the format "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the malignancy is NA (not confirmed), the Gleason should also be NA. Additionally, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, so even if there was a malignancy, if it's not reported, it's NA. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is NA because it's undetermined, and Gleason is NA because there's no mention of grades and malignancy isn't confirmed.
