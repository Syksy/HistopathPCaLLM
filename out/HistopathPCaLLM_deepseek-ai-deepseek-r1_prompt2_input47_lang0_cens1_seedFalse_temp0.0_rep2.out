Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70." The mention of "sample material" without specifying the procedure type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present here. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." Since it's uncertain, the malignancy isn't confirmed as yes or no. So Malignancy should be NA.

For Gleason grade, the statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. The numbers 30+40=70 refer to the amount of prostatic material, not Gleason grades. Therefore, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as NA.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
