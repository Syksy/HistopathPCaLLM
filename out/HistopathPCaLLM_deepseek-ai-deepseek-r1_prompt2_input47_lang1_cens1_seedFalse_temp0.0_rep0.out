Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate samples and structure the data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each of the requirements step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Tutkitaan näytemateriaalia oikealta ja vasemmalta. Eturauhasmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on noin 30+40=70." The term "näytemateriaalia" translates to sample material, but there's no specific mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text just mentions examining material from left and right. So, the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, "Sampletype" should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla." This translates to "It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right." Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain, the answer here isn't "kyllä" (yes) or "ei" (no). The correct value is "NA".

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy couldn't be determined, there's no Gleason score reported. So, "Gleason" is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is undetermined, and no Gleason score is provided.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
