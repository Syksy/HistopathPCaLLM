Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input text is in Finnish, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Tutkitaan näytemateriaalia oikealta ja vasemmalta. Eturauhasmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on noin 30+40=70." The term "näytemateriaalia" translates to sample material, but there's no mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text just mentions the total amount of prostate material. So, since the sample type isn't specified, the answer here should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states: "Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla." This translates to "It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right." Since the presence of malignancy is uncertain, the answer here isn't clearly yes or no. The instructions say to return "NA" if malignancy can't be determined. So Malignancy should be "NA".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since the malignancy is undetermined, there's no Gleason reported. Even if there were some numbers mentioned (like 30+40=70), that's about the amount of material, not Gleason grades. So Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as "NA" because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy is undetermined, and no Gleason is mentioned.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
