Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The goal is to fill in three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by understanding each field's requirements.

First, Sampletype can be "biopsy", "RP" (which I assume stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA". I need to look at the text to determine which one applies. The given example uses "biopsy" when the sample is a biopsy. In the current case, the statement starts with "Examining prostate resection..." Resection typically refers to surgical removal, so RP might be the right choice here. But wait, TURP is also a type of resection. However, TURP is usually for removing part of the prostate to relieve symptoms, while RP is the complete removal. The mention of seminal vesicles being examined might indicate a more extensive surgery, like RP. So Sampletype is likely "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason grade, the format should be "major+minor=sum". The example given was "4+3=7". The current statement says, "SUMMARY: Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." But I need to check if there's a more detailed breakdown. The text mentions two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 as the most common and 3 next, which would be 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small portion of 4. However, the summary states Gleason 9. Wait, how does that add up? Gleason scores are determined by the primary and secondary grades. If the highest grade is 5 in one focus and 4 in another, but the summary says 9, that would be 4+5=9 or 5+4=9. The user instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The second focus has Gleason 5 as the primary (since it's >80%) and 4 as secondary, but that would be 5+4=9. However, the summary directly states Gleason 9. Since the summary is the conclusive part, maybe we should go with that. But the example uses the specific grades mentioned in the text. Let me check the original text again. The first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5 (major) and 4 (minor), so 5+4=9. The summary says Gleason 9. Since the most severe lesion is the second focus with 5+4=9, that's the one to report. So Gleason should be "5+4=9".

Wait, but the user instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The second focus has Gleason 5 as the major and 4 as minor, which sums to 9. The summary also states Gleason 9. So the correct Gleason grade is 5+4=9. However, sometimes the highest grade is reported as the primary, so even if there are multiple patterns, the highest sum is taken. In this case, the summary confirms it's Gleason 9, so that's the one to use. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "5+4=9".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "RP" (prostate resection), Malignancy is "yes", and Gleason is "5+4=9".
