Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it starts with "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." The term "resection" here is key. Since it's a prostate resection, and considering common procedures, RP is the likely sample type. TURP is another type of resection, but typically for removing tissue from the prostate in cases of BPH, but the mention of seminal vesicles being sampled (cassettes I & J) is more indicative of a radical prostatectomy, which includes removal of the seminal vesicles. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The statement clearly mentions "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" and "Capsule invasion and perineural growth observed." Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so Malignancy is "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The summary states "SUMMARY: Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." However, looking at the details: the first focus has Gleason 4+3=7, and the second focus has Gleason 5 (major) + 4 (minor) =9. The summary mentions Gleason 9, which aligns with the second focus. The highest Gleason score is 9, so the correct format is "5+4=9". But wait, the user example uses "4+3=7", so the format is major + minor = sum. The second focus has >80% Gleason 5, so major is 5, minor is 4. So "5+4=9". The summary says Gleason 9, which matches. So the Gleason value should be "5+4=9".

Wait, but the user example uses the specific grades mentioned in the text. The problem says to take the most severe lesion. The first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5+4=9. The most severe is the second, so Gleason 5+4=9. The summary also states Gleason 9, which is the sum. So the correct entry is "5+4=9".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (from prostate resection, which is radical prostatectomy)
Malignancy: yes (adenocarcinoma present)
Gleason: 5+4=9 (from the most severe lesion, second focus)
