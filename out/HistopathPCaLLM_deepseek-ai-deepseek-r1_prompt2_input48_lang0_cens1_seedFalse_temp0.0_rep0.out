Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three specific fields. First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA.

Looking at the input text: "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies..." Autopsies are post-mortem examinations, so the sample isn't from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, the sample type should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes" but also states "Seminal vesicles are all clean" and "unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals." There's no clear mention of malignancy like adenocarcinoma or tumor. The summary also says it's not used to derive differentiation scores, which includes Gleason. So malignancy is probably "no" or NA. But since there's no explicit mention of malignancy, maybe "NA" is safer. Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. If there's no evidence of malignancy, should it be "no"? But the text says "unable to determine," so maybe "NA" is better here.

Third, the Gleason grade. The summary explicitly says "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." So there's no Gleason reported. Hence, Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's from autopsies, which isn't one of the allowed types. Malignancy is NA since it's unclear and they couldn't determine. Gleason is NA as per the summary statement.
