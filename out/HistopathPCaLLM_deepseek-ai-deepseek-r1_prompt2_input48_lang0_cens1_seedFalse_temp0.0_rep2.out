Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to structure the given medical text into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The rules are to take the most severe lesion's info and avoid nested structures.

First, the original sample type. The text mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Autopsy isn't one of the allowed options, so Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The text says "Some exemplifying histological changes" and "interesting patterns" but also states "Seminal vesicles are all clean" and "due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores." There's no mention of malignancy like adenocarcinoma or tumor. So Malignancy is "no" or maybe "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, maybe "no" if benign changes are present, but the example given for NA was when the text was gibberish. Here, the text is coherent but doesn't confirm malignancy. However, the summary says it's not used for differentiation scores, which includes Gleason. But the absence of malignant terms like tumor or cancer might mean Malignancy is "no". Hmm, but the example where Gleason was mentioned but it's for education, so maybe they didn't find malignancy. Let's go with "no".

Gleason grade: The text explicitly says "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." So no Gleason reported. Hence, Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy no, Gleason NA. Wait, but the example where Gleason was mentioned but for education still used NA. So yes, here they say Gleason isn't derived, so NA. Malignancy: since there's no mention of cancer, just some changes, maybe "no". But the example with invalid text had NA for all. However, in this case, the text is valid but doesn't indicate malignancy. So "no" for Malignancy. So the final JSON should be:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
</think>

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
