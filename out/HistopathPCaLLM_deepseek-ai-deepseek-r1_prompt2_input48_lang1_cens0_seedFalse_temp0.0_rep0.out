Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given report starts with "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti, paino 100g." The term "resekaatti" in Finnish translates to "resection specimen." Radical prostatectomy specimens are typically referred to as resection specimens, so the sample type here is likely RP.

Next, check for malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" (adenocarcinoma), which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The summary states "YHTEENVETO: Resekaatissa löydettiin siis Gleason 9 kasvain." So the total is 9. However, the detailed description mentions two foci. The first has Gleason 4+3=7, and the second has Gleason 5 (with a minor component of 4). The highest Gleason would be 5+4=9. But the summary directly states Gleason 9, which aligns with the second focus. The correct format is major + minor = sum. So "5+4=9".

Wait, but the example uses the specific components from the text. The first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5 (major) with some 4 (minor). So the second focus's Gleason would be 5+4=9. The summary confirms it's Gleason 9, so the correct entry is "5+4=9".

Sampletype is RP because it's a resection specimen from a prostatectomy. Malignancy is yes. Gleason is 5+4=9.
