Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The given report starts with "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti, paino 100g." The term "resekaatti" in Finnish translates to "resection specimen," which typically refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP). So the sample type here should be RP. I need to confirm that there's no mention of biopsy or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's a resection specimen, RP is the correct choice.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The report states "Histologisesti löydetään adenokarsinooma..." which means adenocarcinoma was found. Adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, so the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result in "major+minor=sum" format. The example given was "4+3=7". The report mentions two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 as the most common (major) and 3 as the next (minor), so 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) with a small part being 4. However, the summary at the end says "YHTEENVETO: Resekaatissa löydettiin siis Gleason 9 kasvain." Wait, that's conflicting. The individual foci are 4+3=7 and 5+4=9 (since the major is 5 and minor is 4). But the summary states Gleason 9. According to guidelines, the overall Gleason score is based on the highest (worst) pattern found. So even if there are multiple foci, the highest sum is taken. However, the user instruction says to take the worst lesion's result. The second focus has Gleason 5+4=9, which is the highest. But the summary says Gleason 9, which aligns with that. However, the example given in the problem uses the specific major and minor from the worst lesion. The report's first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5+4=9. So the worst is 5+4=9. But the summary says "Gleason 9 kasvain," which is the sum. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". So in the second focus, major is 5, minor is 4, sum 9. So the correct Gleason should be "5+4=9". However, the user example uses the specific components from the worst lesion. The summary might be just stating the sum, but the actual components are in the text. So the answer should be "5+4=9". But wait, the report's first focus is 4+3=7, the second is 5+4=9. The worst is 5+4=9, so that's the one to report. The summary mentions Gleason 9, which is the sum. So the correct entry is "5+4=9".

But let me check again. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion's results). The second focus has Gleason 5 as the major and 4 as minor. So 5+4=9. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "5+4=9". The summary's mention of Gleason 9 is just the total, but the required format includes the components. So the answer is "5+4=9".
