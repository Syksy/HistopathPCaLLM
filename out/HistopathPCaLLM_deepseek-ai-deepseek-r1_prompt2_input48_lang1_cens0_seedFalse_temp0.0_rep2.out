Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The input text starts with "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti, paino 100g." The term "prostataresekaatti" translates to prostate resection specimen. In medical terms, RP stands for radical prostatectomy, which is a type of resection. So the sample type here should be "RP". The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Since this is a resection, RP fits.

Next, malignancy. The report mentions "adenokarsinooma" which is adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now the tricky part: Gleason grade. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's result. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum". The report has two foci. The first focus has Gleason 4 as the most common (major) and 3 as the next (minor), which would be 4+3=7. The second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) as major and 4 as minor, so 5+4=9. The summary states "YHTEENVETO: Resekaatissa löydettiin siis Gleason 9 kasvain." So the highest sum here is 9. But according to the rules, we need to report the major and minor components of the worst lesion. The second focus's major is 5 and minor is 4, so 5+4=9. Even though the summary says Gleason 9, the correct format is to take the major and minor from the worst lesion. So the Gleason should be "5+4=9".

Wait, but the example given in the instructions uses the major and minor from the same focus. The user's instruction says "pahimman leesion tulokset". The worst lesion here is the second focus with Gleason 5 and 4. So the correct Gleason is 5+4=9. The summary mentions Gleason 9, which aligns with that sum. So the answer should be "5+4=9".
