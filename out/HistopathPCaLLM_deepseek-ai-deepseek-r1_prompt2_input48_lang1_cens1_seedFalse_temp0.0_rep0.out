Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given report mentions "ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" which translates to "material obtained from autopsy". None of the allowed values match this, so Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" (some exemplary histological changes) and mentions that they are used for demonstration purposes. There's no mention of malignancy like adenocarsinooma or other cancer terms. The summary also says these findings aren't used to determine differentiation grades, implying no malignancy. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, the example in the instructions uses Gleason 4+3=7. Here, the report explicitly says not to use the findings to determine differentiation grades, even though Gleason 1-5 is mentioned as an example. Since it's for demonstration and not actual diagnosis, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy ei, Gleason NA. Need to ensure JSON format without nested structures and only the worst lesion, which isn't applicable here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
