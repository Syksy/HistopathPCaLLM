Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" which translates to "material obtained from autopsy". None of the allowed values (biopsy, RP, TURP) match an autopsy sample. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Joitakin esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia" (some exemplary histological changes) and mentions that they can't determine differentiation grades, but there's no mention of malignancy like adenocarcinooma or other cancer terms. The summary also says these findings aren't used to determine differentiation grades, which implies they aren't malignant. So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, the example in the instructions uses Gleason 1-5, but the summary here says "esim. Gleason 1-5" as an example, not an actual score. Since there's no actual Gleason sum reported and the findings aren't used for grading, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy ei, Gleason NA.
