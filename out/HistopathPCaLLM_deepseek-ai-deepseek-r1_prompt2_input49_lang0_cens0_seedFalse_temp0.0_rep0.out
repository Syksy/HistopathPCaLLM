Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values for each are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses. Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma." The term "prostate chippings" and "shavings" makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where tissue is chipped away. So Sampletype here is likely "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement mentions that 5 shavings contained carcinoma. Since carcinoma is a malignant tumor, the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the input says: "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the most common (major) and second most common (minor) grades. So that would be 3 + 4 = 7. The format requested is "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I also need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. In this case, there's only one mentioned, so that's straightforward. No nested structures in the JSON, just the three fields. Let me double-check the allowed values and the example provided to make sure the formatting is correct. The example uses "4+3=7" as the Gleason value, so following that pattern, "3+4=7" is correct. All other fields fit the allowed values. No mention of biopsy or RP, so TURP is the right choice. Malignancy is definitely "yes" because carcinoma is present. The Gleason is properly formatted. I think that's all. Time to put it into JSON.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
