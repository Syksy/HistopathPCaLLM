Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, and I need to make sure I only consider the most severe lesion mentioned.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (which stands for radical prostatectomy), "TURP" (transurethral resection of the prostate), or "NA" if not mentioned. Looking at the input statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses. Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma." The term "chippings" and "shavings" might refer to TURP samples because TURP often results in tissue chips or shavings. Biopsy samples are usually core needle biopsies, which are different. RP would be the entire prostate removed. So here, the sample type is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The statement says "5 shavings contained carcinoma." Carcinoma indicates malignancy, so the answer here should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the statement mentions "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary (most common) and secondary (second most common) grades. So that would be 3 + 4 = 7. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "3+4=7".

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's only one mention of carcinoma with Gleason 3+4, that's the one to report. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 3+4=7. All other possible data points in the text don't contradict these findings. There's no mention of other sample types like biopsy or RP, so TURP is correct. The example given in the problem uses a similar structure, so following that format is key here.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
