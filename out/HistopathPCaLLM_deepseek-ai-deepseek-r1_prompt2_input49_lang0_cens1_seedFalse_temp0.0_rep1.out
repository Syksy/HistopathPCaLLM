Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I assume stands for Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possible due to the technical limitations." The term "glasses" here might be a translation or typo for "slides" or "samples." However, there's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. So the Sampletype should be NA.

Next, determining if there were malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "some changes that warrant further investigation," but it doesn't explicitly state the presence of a malignant tumor. Since the assessment is inconclusive due to technical limitations, we can't confirm malignancy. So Malignancy should be NA.

For the Gleason grade, the text doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. There's no reference to numbers like 3+4=7 or anything similar. Therefore, Gleason should be NA.

I need to ensure that only the most severe lesion is considered, but since there's no clear indication of any lesion's severity here, all fields default to NA. Also, the example provided shows that if the information isn't present or is inconclusive, NA is used. So the final JSON should have all three fields as NA.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
