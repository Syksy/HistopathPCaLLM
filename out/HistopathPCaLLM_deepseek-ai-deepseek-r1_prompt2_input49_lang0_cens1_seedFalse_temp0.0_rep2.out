Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The allowed values are specified, so I need to make sure I adhere to those.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possible due to the technical limitations." The term "glasses" here might refer to slides, which are typically used in biopsies. However, the text doesn't explicitly mention biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So maybe Sampletype is "NA" because it's not clear. But sometimes "glasses" in pathology reports can indicate biopsy samples. Wait, but the example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "prostate biopsy". Here, the text says "prostate samples on 8 glasses" which might be part of a biopsy procedure. However, the problem says to use "NA" if it's not clear. Hmm. The example uses "biopsy" when the term is explicit. Here, it's not explicit. So maybe Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". The text mentions "some changes that warrant further investigation" but doesn't confirm malignancy. Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor, and the assessment is inconclusive due to technical limitations, Malignancy should be "NA".

For Gleason grade, since there's no mention of any Gleason score or grades (like 3+4=7), and malignancy isn't confirmed, the Gleason field should be "NA".

So putting it all together, all three fields would be "NA". Let me check the example again. The first example had explicit terms: "Adenocarcinoma" (so malignancy yes), "biopsy", and Gleason. The second example was a jumbled text with no clear info, so all NAs. In the current case, the text is unclear about the sample type (glasses could be biopsy, but not explicitly stated), malignancy isn't confirmed, and no Gleason mentioned. Therefore, the structured JSON should have all NAs.

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
