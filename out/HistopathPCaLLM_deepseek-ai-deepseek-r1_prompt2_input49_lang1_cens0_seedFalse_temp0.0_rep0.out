Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "höyläyslastuista" which translates to "shavings" or "chips." TURP is a procedure where tissue is removed in small pieces, often referred to as chips. So "höyläyslastuista" likely corresponds to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, malignancy. The text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma." Karsinooma is carcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Third, Gleason grade. The report states "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." The usual way to report Gleason is primary (major) + secondary (minor) = sum. Here, the most common is 3, next is 4. So it would be 3+4=7. However, the order matters. Wait, the primary pattern is the most prevalent, so if 3 is the most common (major) and 4 is the next (minor), then it's 3+4=7. But sometimes the highest grade is taken if there are multiple patterns. Wait, no, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. So in this case, major is 3, minor is 4. So Gleason should be "3+4=7".

I need to make sure there's no higher grade mentioned. The text doesn't mention any other grades. So the answer should be 3+4=7. The example given in the problem uses "4+3=7" which is a higher grade group than 3+4, but the user instructions say to take the worst lesion. However, in Gleason scoring, the sum is the same, but the grouping is different. However, the user's example uses "4+3=7" and the output is just the sum as "4+3=7". The instruction says to report the pahimman leesion (worst lesion) results. So if there are multiple patterns, we take the highest Gleason. Wait, but the user's example just takes the major and minor as reported. The example given in the problem statement has "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7" which becomes "4+3=7". So the order is based on the primary and secondary patterns as stated. In the current case, the most common is 3, next is 4, so 3+4=7. But in some cases, the highest grade is considered the primary even if less extensive. Wait, no, according to current Gleason grading, the primary is the most prevalent pattern, and the secondary is the next most prevalent. If there's a tertiary pattern (higher grade), that might be considered, but the text here doesn't mention a tertiary. So the correct sum here is 3+4=7. However, in clinical practice, sometimes the highest grade is listed first if there are multiple, but the user's example seems to follow the order mentioned in the text. Since the text says "Tavallisin (most common) Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin (next most common) Gleason luokka 4," the correct notation is 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7
</think>

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
