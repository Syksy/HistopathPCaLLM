Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each one step by step.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "höyläyslastuista" and "höyläyslastuista" again. I remember that "höyläys" translates to "shaving" or "resection", which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So the sample type here is likely TURP. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text says "biopsiasta", so similar logic applies here. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text states that in 5 of the samples, they found "karsinooma", which is carcinoma, a malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason. The format should be "major+minor=sum" as integers. The report says the most common Gleason grade is 3, and the next most common is 4. In Gleason scoring, the primary (major) pattern is the most prevalent, and the secondary (minor) is the next. So major is 3, minor is 4, sum is 7. Therefore, Gleason should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the order might be based on higher grade, but the problem states "tavallisin" (most common) and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common). So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the correct notation is 3+4=7. The example given in the problem had 4+3=7, but that's when the primary was 4. Here, since 3 is the most common, it's primary. So the sum is still 7, but the order is 3+4=7.

I need to make sure that the answer follows the major+minor order. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset", which means the worst lesion's results. But in Gleason scoring, the primary is the most extensive, and the secondary is the next most extensive. However, if the highest grade is present, even if it's less extensive, the current grading system (Grade Groups) might consider it. But the problem statement specifies to use the major (most common) and minor (next most common) as per the text. The text here clearly states "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So the correct Gleason is 3+4=7.

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP (since höyläyslastu refers to TURP samples)
Malignancy: kyllä (carcinoma found)
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
