Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The original text mentions "höyläyslastuista" and "lastua". "Höyläys" translates to something like shaving or planing, which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Biopsy would be "biopsia" in Finnish. RP is radical prostatectomy. So here, since it's höyläyslastuista, Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, Malignancy. The text says "5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma". Karsinooma is carcinoma, which is malignant. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

Then Gleason. The report states "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." The usual way to report Gleason is major + minor = sum. The most common (major) is 3, next (minor) is 4. So sum is 3+4=7. Wait, but the order is important. The highest grade is the major. Wait, in Gleason scoring, the primary pattern (major) is the most common, and the secondary (minor) is the next most common. But if there's a higher grade present, even if less common, it might take precedence. Wait, no, the primary is the most predominant, and secondary is the next. So in this case, the most common is 3, so primary is 3, secondary is 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. So the format should be "3+4=7".

Wait, but sometimes the higher grade is considered the primary even if less common. But the text says "tavallisin" (most common) is 3, and "seuraavaksi yleisin" (next most common) is 4. So primary is 3, secondary is 4. So sum is 3+4=7. So the correct Gleason field is "3+4=7".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 3+4=7

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
