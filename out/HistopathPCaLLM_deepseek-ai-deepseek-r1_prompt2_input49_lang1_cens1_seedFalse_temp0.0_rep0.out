Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The example given helps, so I need to follow that closely.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The input text here is "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla. Näistä viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia. Juuri nyt löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia." Translating that, it mentions "prostatanäytteistä" which means prostate samples. But the sample type isn't specified as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example where it's unclear uses "NA", so maybe here it's also NA since the type isn't mentioned.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The text says there are some changes needing further investigation, but evaluation isn't possible due to technical limitations. Since they can't confirm malignancy, the answer here should be "NA" because it's uncertain. The example where malignancy couldn't be determined also used "NA".

For Gleason score, it's only reported if malignancy is confirmed. Since malignancy is NA here, Gleason should be "NA" as well. The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, which supports that.

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, malignancy is NA because it's not evaluable, and Gleason is NA accordingly.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
