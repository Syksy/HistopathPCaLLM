Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The example given helps, so I need to follow that closely.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text here is "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The key word here is "prostatanäytteistä," which translates to prostate samples. However, the example given in the problem where the sample type was "biopsy" had the word "biopsiasta." Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radikaaliprostatektomia), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text just mentions examining the remaining prostate samples on 8 slides. So there's no specific information about the sample type. Therefore, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text says that in the fifth slide, some changes were seen that require further investigation. However, it also states that evaluation isn't possible right now due to technical limitations. Since the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed and the report says they can't evaluate the findings currently, we can't say "kyllä" or "ei". So Malignancy should be "NA".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is major+minor=sum. But since malignancy isn't confirmed and the findings can't be evaluated, there's no Gleason reported. So Gleason should be "NA".

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. In this case, since there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy or specific sample type, all fields are NA. The example provided for an unclear report also sets all to NA, which matches this scenario.

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
