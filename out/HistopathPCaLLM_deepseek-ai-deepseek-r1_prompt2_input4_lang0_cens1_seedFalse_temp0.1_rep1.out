Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations. One sample part appears to be not representative, as it contains no prostate tissue..." The text mentions "sampling sites" and "sample part," which might suggest a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. However, terms like "sampled tissue" and "sample material" are common in biopsy contexts. But since the sample isn't clearly specified as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe I should go with NA here. Wait, but sometimes "sampling sites" in prostate context often refer to biopsy. Hmm, but the user says if it's not clear, use NA. The example given for NA was when the text was gibberish, but here it's a valid statement but maybe the sample type isn't specified. Let me check again. The text doesn't mention biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text says, "no notable atypic patterns are present," and "insufficient to reliably assess... presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." Since they couldn't assess due to insufficient material, but no malignancy was found in what they observed. However, the absence of atypia suggests no malignancy, but the report states that the sample is insufficient to reliably assess. So maybe malignancy is "no" because they didn't find any, but the uncertainty is due to insufficient sample. Wait, the key is whether there were malignant findings. The text says no notable atypia, which are pre-malignant or malignant changes. So if there's no atypia, that points to no malignancy. But the sample is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma. So maybe the answer is "no" because they didn't find any, but the sample is inadequate. Alternatively, since they can't reliably assess, maybe it's NA. The example given for NA was when the text was invalid. Here, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The user instructions say to return "no" if there's no malignancy found. Since they explicitly say "no notable atypic patterns," which are indicators of malignancy, so malignancy is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no malignancy reported (malignancy is "no"), the Gleason should be NA. The Gleason is only for malignant cases. So even if there's a mention of Gleason elsewhere, if malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. In this text, there's no mention of Gleason at all. So definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy no, Gleason NA.
