Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given example and the instructions again to make sure I understand what's required.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "prostata biopsiasta" which became "biopsy". In the current case, the input mentions "prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista" in the first sentence. So the samples are prostate biopsies. Even though sample 3 isn't representative, the others are. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes found. That means malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested objects and uses the exact keys and allowed values. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. "Prostatabiopsiat" is plural, but the sample type is still biopsy. The key point is that the samples are biopsies. Even if some samples are non-representative, the main type is biopsy. Malignancy is clearly negative here. Gleason isn't applicable. So the JSON should reflect that.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
