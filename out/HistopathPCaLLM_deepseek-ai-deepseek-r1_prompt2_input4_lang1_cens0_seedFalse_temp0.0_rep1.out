Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The instructions mention that only the worst lesion results should be reported, and the structure shouldn't be nested. Also, the allowed values for each field are specified.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided report, the text starts with "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The Finnish word "prostatabiopsiat" translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type here is biopsy. That should be "biopsy" for the first field.

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states, "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." Translating that: "Thus, no carcinoma or PIN changes were found in the samples." Since there's no mention of malignancy (carcinoma is a type of malignancy), the answer here should be "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason field should be "NA".

I need to make sure there's no mention of any Gleason scores in the report. The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the absence of malignancy. So all three fields are clear: biopsy, no malignancy, and NA for Gleason.

Double-checking the example given in the problem. The first example had a biopsy with malignancy and a Gleason score. The second example was a nonsensical text, so all fields were NA. In this case, the sample is biopsy, no malignancy, so Gleason is NA. That fits the structure required.
