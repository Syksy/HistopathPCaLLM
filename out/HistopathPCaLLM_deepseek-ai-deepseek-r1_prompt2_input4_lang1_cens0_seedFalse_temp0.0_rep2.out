Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given example and the instructions again to make sure I understand what's required.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given for "biopsy" was when the text mentioned "prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the input text starts with "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." So "prostatabiopsiat" is plural for prostate biopsies. So the sample type here should be "biopsy". Even though sample 3 isn't representative, the others are, and the main type is biopsy.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." So no carcinoma or PIN changes found. That means malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The example showed that if there's no malignancy, Gleason is NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason scores because there's no cancer detected.

Let me double-check. The sample type is definitely biopsy. Malignancy is "ei" because no cancer found. Gleason is NA. The example also had Gleason as NA when there was no malignancy. So the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I think that's correct. The key points are recognizing "prostatabiopsiat" as biopsy samples, the absence of carcinoma, and thus no Gleason score needed.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
