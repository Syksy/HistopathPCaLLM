Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatabiopsiat" which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." That means no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. So malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the value should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which makes sense because there's no cancer detected.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided uses flat keys, so the output should follow that. Also, only the worst lesion's results are considered, but in this case, there are no malignant findings. 

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatabiopsiat" clearly indicates biopsy. Malignancy is negative. Gleason isn't applicable here. All fields fit the allowed values. No typos in the JSON keys. Looks good.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
