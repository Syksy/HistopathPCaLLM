Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The goal is to fill three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me start by reading through the provided example and the sample input to understand the requirements better.

First, the sample input given is in Finnish. The example provided shows that for a biopsy mentioning adenocarcinoma with Gleason 4+3=7, the JSON output should have "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7". The other example, which is a more jumbled text, results in all NA values because it's not a coherent report.

Now, looking at the actual input to process: 

"Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista. Näytteen 3 biopsiasylinterit eivät edustavia, sillä siinä ei nähdä prostatakudosta. Muutoin näytteet ovat edustavat ja nähdään benigniä prostatakudosta. Rauhasepiteeleissä ei myöskään havaita merkittävää atypiaa. Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia."

Translating the key parts: The sample is 1-6 prostate biopsies from specific sites. Sample 3's cylinders are not representative as no prostate tissue is seen. Otherwise, samples are representative and show benign prostate tissue. No significant atypia in glandular epithelium. No carcinoma or PIN changes found.

Now, let's break down each field:

1. Sampletype: The text mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which is Finnish for prostate biopsies. So the type is biopsy. Even though sample 3 isn't representative, the overall sample type is still biopsy. So "biopsy".

2. Malignancy: The report states "ei löydetä karsinoomaa" (no carcinoma found) and no PIN changes. So malignancy is "ei".

3. Gleason: Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score isn't applicable. So "NA".

Putting it all together, the JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are included. Since all samples except 3 are benign and 3 isn't representative, there's no malignancy. Gleason is NA because there's no cancer. The sample type is clearly biopsy.

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
