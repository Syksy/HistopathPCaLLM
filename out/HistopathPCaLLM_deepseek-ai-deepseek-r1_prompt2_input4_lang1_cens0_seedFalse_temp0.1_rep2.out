Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The user wants three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason score. Let's break down each part based on the provided example and instructions.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista." The key term here is "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, checking for malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states, "Näytteistä ei siis löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia." This means no carcinoma or PIN changes were found. So malignancy is "ei".

For the Gleason score, the format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since there's no malignancy, Gleason should be "NA".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported and avoid nested structures. The example given for a non-malignant case correctly uses "NA" for Gleason. Also, the sample type is clearly biopsy here. There's no mention of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection), so "biopsy" is correct.

Double-checking the Finnish terms: "prostatabiopsiat" is plural, but the sample type is singular in the answer. The example uses "biopsy" for a similar term, so that's acceptable. The malignancy is correctly "ei" as no cancer was found. Gleason is "NA" because there's no malignancy.

Everything seems to fit. The answer should be straightforward without any nested structures, just the three keys with the determined values.
