Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and structure the data into specific JSON fields. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The term "näyttöönottokohtia" refers to sample collection points. The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the report talks about multiple sampling points from standard locations, which sounds like biopsies. But there's also a part where one sample isn't representative because it lacks normal prostate tissue. However, the rest of the samples are considered representative. The key here is to determine the original sample type. Since they mention "näytteinä käsitelty kudos" (tissue processed as samples) and the method seems to be taking multiple samples from standard locations, this likely refers to a biopsy procedure. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, malignancy. The report states that the sample material isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also mentions that no atypical structures were found in the observed prostate tissue. However, the key point here is whether malignant findings were present. Since the sample is inadequate to confirm or rule out malignancy, but there's no positive identification of malignancy, the answer might be "ei" (no). Wait, but the problem says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample is insufficient to assess, does that mean they didn't find any malignancy, or it's uncertain? The instructions say if there are no malignant findings, it's "ei". But if the sample is inadequate, maybe it's "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says "näytemateriaali itsessään ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman tai PIN-kaltaisten muutosten läsnäoloa." So they can't reliably assess, but the existing tissue doesn't show any atypical structures. The question is, does "ei" mean no malignancy found, or "NA" if it's uncertain. The example given in the problem for an unclear report uses "NA" for malignancy. But in this case, the report says that in the observed tissue, there are no atypical structures, but the sample is insufficient to assess. So maybe the malignancy is "ei" because they didn't find any, but the sample is inadequate. Wait, the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). If there's no malignancy found, but the sample is inadequate, perhaps the answer is "ei" because no malignancy was detected in the examined samples. Alternatively, if the sample is inadequate, maybe it's "NA". Hmm. Let me check the example again. The example where the text was nonsensical used "NA" for all. In the given case here, the report says that the sample is insufficient to assess, but in the observed tissue, there's nothing atypical. So maybe the malignancy is "ei" because they didn't find any, but the sample is inadequate. But the problem states that if there's no malignancy, it's "ei". Since they didn't find any malignancy in the examined samples, even though the sample is inadequate, the answer would be "ei". But I need to be careful here. The key is whether malignant findings are present. If the sample is inadequate, but no malignancy is found in the examined parts, then "ei". If the sample is inadequate to determine, but no signs found, then "ei". If the report says they can't exclude it due to insufficient material, but no positive findings, then "ei". So I think "Malignancy" should be "ei".

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy reported (Malignancy is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA". The instructions say that Gleason is "NA" for benign findings. So if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (since it's from standard locations, likely biopsy)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found in the examined samples)
Gleason: NA (because no malignancy)
