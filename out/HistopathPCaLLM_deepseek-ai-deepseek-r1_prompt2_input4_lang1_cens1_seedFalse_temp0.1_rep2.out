Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided text: "Useita näyttöönottokohtia oli saatavilla standardilokaatioista." The term "näyttöönottokohtia" suggests biopsy samples. The mention of standard locations also aligns with biopsy procedures. So Sampletype is likely "biopsy".

Next, check for malignancy. The text says that the sample isn't sufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It also states that no atypical structures were found. Since there's no mention of malignancy being present and the sample is inadequate for confirming it, Malignancy should be "ei" (no). Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. The report says they can't reliably assess due to insufficient material. But the absence of detected malignancy might mean "ei". However, the instructions say if the sample is benign, then Gleason is NA. But here, the sample is inadequate. Hmm. The example given for NA was when the text wasn't a meaningful report. Here, the report is meaningful but inconclusive. The key phrase is "ei ole riittävä että voitaisiin luotettavasti arvioida adenokarsinooman... läsnäoloa." So they can't confirm presence, but does that mean malignancy is "ei" or "NA"? Since the sample is inadequate, maybe malignancy is "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The user instructions say "NA" is for benign findings. But here, it's not benign, just insufficient. The original example had "kyllä" when cancer was found, "ei" if benign, and "NA" if unclear. But in this case, the sample is inadequate. So maybe Malignancy should be "NA" because they can't assess. Wait, the user instruction for Malignancy: "hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille" would be "ei". But here, the sample is insufficient to determine. So perhaps "NA" is correct here.

Third, Gleason score. Since there's no malignancy detected (or it's inconclusive), Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's straightforward.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, Malignancy is NA (since they can't confirm), and Gleason is NA.
