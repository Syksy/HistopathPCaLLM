Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the given statement, the first line says "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy..." So that clearly indicates the sample type is RP.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." The term "cancerous" here means malignant, so the answer here is yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two macros: A and B. Macro A has 4+3=7, and Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the most severe is 4+5=9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example given uses a simple key-value structure, so I'll follow that. Also, check if all values are correctly formatted. Sampletype is RP, Malignancy is yes, and Gleason is 4+5=9. No issues here. The other parts of the report mention no capsule penetration or perineural invasion, but that doesn't affect the malignancy answer since cancerous tissue is present. The key is to report the highest Gleason grade from the most severe lesion, which is Macro B in this case.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
