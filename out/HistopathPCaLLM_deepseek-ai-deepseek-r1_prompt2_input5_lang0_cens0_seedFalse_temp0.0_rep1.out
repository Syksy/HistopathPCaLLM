Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, the first line mentions "a radical prostatectomy," so that should be RP. That's straightforward.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The report says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed," which clearly indicates malignancy. So the answer here is yes.

Now, the Gleason grade. The instruction says to take the most severe lesion. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum." In the report, there are two macros mentioned: Macro A has 4+3=7, and Macro B has 4+5=9. Since the highest sum is 9 from Macro B, that's the most severe. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The example provided doesn't have any, so just key-value pairs. Also, check if the statement is valid. The given text is a proper medical report, so it's valid. Therefore, the JSON should have Sampletype as "RP", Malignancy as "yes", and Gleason as "4+5=9".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
