Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given text and extract the required information for the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The text mentions "radical prostatectomy," which is one of the allowed values. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. So here, the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text states "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed," which clearly indicates the presence of malignant tumor. So the answer here is "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to take the most severe lesion. The text mentions two macros: Macro A has 4+3=7, and Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the most severe is 4+5=9. The required format is "major+minor=sum", so "4+5=9".

I need to ensure that the JSON doesn't have nested structures and uses the exact allowed values. Also, confirming there's no mention of biopsy or TURP, so Sampletype is definitely RP. Malignancy is yes because cancerous tissue is present. Gleason is the highest sum, which is 4+5=9. All other details like weight of the prostate or sections are irrelevant here. No mention of benign findings, so no issues there. Capsule penetration or perineural invasion absence doesn't affect malignancy status since cancer is already confirmed.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
