Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to parse the given histopathological statement and extract the required information for the three structured fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

Starting with the Sampletype. The user mentioned allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement begins with "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy..." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as RP, so the Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, checking for Malignancy. The text states "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed..." which clearly indicates the presence of malignant tumor. So Malignancy should be "yes".

Now, the Gleason grade. The instructions specify to take the most severe lesion. The report mentions two macros: Macro A has 4+3=7, and Macro B has 4+5=9. Since 9 is higher than 7, the most severe is 4+5=9. The Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

I need to ensure there's no nested structure in the JSON and that all values are correctly formatted. Let me double-check the example provided. The example uses "biopsy", "yes", and "4+3=7". In this case, the highest Gleason is 4+5=9 from Macro B. So the JSON should reflect that.

Also, confirming that there's no mention of other sample types like TURP or biopsy. The radical prostatectomy (RP) is correctly identified. Malignancy is confirmed as yes due to cancerous tissue. Gleason from the most severe lesion (Macro B) is 4+5=9. All other parts like seminal vehicles being clean don't affect the required fields. Capsule penetration or perineural invasion absence doesn't change malignancy status here since cancer is present.

So the final JSON should be:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
