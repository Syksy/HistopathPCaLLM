Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement: "The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It mentions the sample is from the prostate but doesn't specify the procedure. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue across all basis and apex samplings." Clear tissue without mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor suggests no malignancy. Also, they couldn't infer Gleason grades, which are typically for malignant cases. So Malignancy is likely "no".

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason should be NA. The statement says they couldn't determine major and minor classes, which aligns with no malignancy.

Putting it all together: Sampletype NA, Malignancy no, Gleason NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures and only the most severe lesion is considered. Since there's no mention of any tumor, this should be straightforward.
