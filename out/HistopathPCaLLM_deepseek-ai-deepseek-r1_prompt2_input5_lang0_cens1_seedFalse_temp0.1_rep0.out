Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given statement, it mentions "the sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It talks about sections from left and right, processed with dyes, and samples from apex and basis. The processing methods (like dye colors) and terms like "samples taken" might suggest a biopsy, but the description isn't clear. The sample types mentioned (A to H) could be biopsy cores, but the text doesn't explicitly state if it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since there's no direct mention of the procedure type, I should mark this as NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." Clear tissue without mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor suggests no malignancy. Also, it says that Gleason grades couldn't be inferred, which might imply no malignancy since Gleason is typically for cancer grading. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason grade, the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or NA. Since the statement says that Major and minor Gleason classes couldn't be inferred and there's no mention of a sum, and given that Malignancy is "no", Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified, Malignancy is no due to clear tissue, and Gleason is NA because no grades were determined and there's no malignancy.
