Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It mentions samples taken from apex and basis, processed with dyes, and refers to samples indexed A to H. The terms like "samples taken" and "processed" might suggest a biopsy, but the text doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, sometimes in medical reports, the way samples are handled can hint at the procedure. But since it's not clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP, maybe I should go with NA here. Wait, the example given for a biopsy had "prostate biopsy" explicitly mentioned. Here, there's no such mention. So Sampletype is NA.

Next, Malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." Clear tissue without mention of tumor suggests no malignancy. Also, it says "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred," which might imply no malignancy since Gleason grading is for cancer. So Malignancy should be "no".

For Gleason, the value should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason would be NA. Even though there's mention of "suspected higher sum one," the key point is that the Gleason grades couldn't be inferred, and since there's no malignancy, it's NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is no because the tissue is clear, and Gleason is NA because there's no malignancy and grades couldn't be determined.
