Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text: "The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It mentions samples taken from apex and basis, processed with dyes, and indexed as A to H. The terms "samples taken" and "processed" might suggest a biopsy, but the description isn't explicit. The text doesn't mention a specific procedure like TURP or RP. Since it's unclear, maybe Sampletype should be NA.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." Clear tissue usually means no malignancy. Also, there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or tumor. The part about Gleason grades not being inferred might suggest uncertainty, but the presence of clear tissue leans towards no malignancy. So Malignancy would be "no".

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, else NA. Since Malignancy is "no", Gleason should be NA. Even though the text mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred," since there's no malignancy, Gleason remains NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified, Malignancy is no due to clear tissue, and Gleason is NA as there's no malignancy.
