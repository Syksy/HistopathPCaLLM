Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia". I know that "radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So the sample type should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)". "Kasvainkudosta" refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to take the worst lesion. The text mentions two macros: A and B. In A, it's 4+3 with 60% dominant. In B, it's 4+5 with sum 9. Since B has a higher sum (9 vs 7), that's the worst. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum". So the major pattern is the first number, minor the second. In B, it's 4+5=9. So the correct format is "4+5=9".

Double-checking the sample type: radical prostatectomy is RP. Malignancy is present. Gleason is the highest reported, which is 4+5=9. All other blocks are clean, so no higher scores elsewhere. So the JSON should have those values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
