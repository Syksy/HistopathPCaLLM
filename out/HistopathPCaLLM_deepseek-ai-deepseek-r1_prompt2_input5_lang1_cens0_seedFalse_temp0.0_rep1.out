Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia". I remember from the examples that "RP" is the allowed value for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The report says there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) in both apex macros (A+B). Also, they mention Gleason scores, which are indicators of cancer. So Malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason grade. The instructions say to take the worst lesion. In the text, there are two areas: Makrossa A has 4+3=7 with 60% dominant, and Makrossa B has 4+5=9 with 50% and 20%. The highest sum here is 9 (4+5=9). Since we need the worst one, it's 4+5=9. So Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum". The major is the higher grade, right? Wait, no, Gleason scoring is the sum of the two most common patterns, where the first number is the primary (most prevalent) and the second is the secondary. But in the case of Makrossa B, it's 4+5=9. So the primary is 4 and secondary is 5, but the sum is 9. However, sometimes the higher grade is considered the major, but according to standard Gleason scoring, it's primary (most common) + secondary (next common) = sum. So in this case, the report states "4+5=9", so the correct format is "4+5=9". Since this is the highest sum (9) compared to 7 in the other sample, this is the worst lesion. So the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

Double-checking the sample type: "radikaali prostatektomia" is RP. Malignancy is present. Gleason is the highest reported, which is 4+5=9. All other blocks are clean, so the worst is in B. So the JSON should have those values.
