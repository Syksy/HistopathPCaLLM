Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to radical prostatectomy. The allowed values are "biopsy," "RP," "TURP," or "NA." "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy, so the sample type here should be "RP."

Next, check for malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." Kasvainkudosta refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The text mentions two macros: A and B. In macro A, it's 4+3 with 60% dominant. In macro B, it's 4+5 with sum 9. Since B has a higher sum (9 vs. 7), the worst is 4+5=9. However, the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum." So the correct Gleason here should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the example in the problem statement used the sum from a biopsy. However, in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, sometimes the grading might consider the highest Gleason found. The user specified to take the pahimman leesion tulokset (worst lesion results). So between 4+3=7 and 4+5=9, the worst is 4+5=9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

But I need to check if the text mentions which one is the worst. The text says "Makrossa B havaitaan korkeamman pistesumman (9) kasvua 4+5..." Korkeamman means higher, so B is the higher sum. Therefore, the worst Gleason is 4+5=9.

So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: RP

Malignancy: kyllä

Gleason: 4+5=9
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
