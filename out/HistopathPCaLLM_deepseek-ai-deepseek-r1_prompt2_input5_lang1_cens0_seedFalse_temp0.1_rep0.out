Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "radikaali prostatektomia". The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. "Radikaali prostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, so RP is the correct value here.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)". "Kasvainkudosta" refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So malignancy should be "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason grade, the instructions say to take the worst lesion. The text mentions two areas: Makrossa A has 4+3=7 with 60% dominant, and Makrossa B has 4+5=9 with 50% and 20%. The worst is 4+5=9, so that's the one to report. The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+5=9".

I need to ensure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst Gleason. The example given uses the highest sum, which here is 9 from 4+5. So the correct Gleason field is "4+5=9".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
