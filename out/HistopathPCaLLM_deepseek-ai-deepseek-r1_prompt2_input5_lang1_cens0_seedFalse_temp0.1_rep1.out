Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text starts with "Tutkittavana on radikaali prostatektomia," which translates to "The sample under examination is a radical prostatectomy." So the sample type should be "RP". That's straightforward.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report mentions "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." "Kasvainkudosta" refers to tumor tissue, which is malignant. So malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

Now, the Gleason score. The instructions say to take the worst lesion's results. The text has two mentions: in macro A, it's 4+3 with 60% dominant, and macro B has 4+5=9 with 50% and 20% portions. Since Gleason scoring takes the highest grade, 4+5=9 is worse than 4+3=7. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum". The highest sum here is 9 from 4+5. So the correct entry is "4+5=9". Even though macro A has a lower sum, macro B's higher sum is the worst, so that's the one to report.

Double-checking the sample type: radical prostatectomy is "RP". Malignancy is present. Gleason is the highest found. All other blocks are clean, but since there are malignant findings, Gleason is required. The answer should be:

Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+5=9
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
