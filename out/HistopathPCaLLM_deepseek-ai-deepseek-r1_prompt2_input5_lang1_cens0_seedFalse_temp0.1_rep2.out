Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the report step by step.

First, the sample type. The report starts with "Tutkittavana on radikaali prostatektomia..." which translates to "The sample under examination is a radical prostatectomy..." So the sample type here is "RP" since RP stands for radical prostatectomy. That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The text mentions "Mikroskooppisesti havaitaan kasvainkudosta molemmissa apexin makroissa (A+B)." So they found tumor tissue in both apex macros, which indicates malignancy. The presence of adenocarcinoma (though not explicitly stated here, but terms like kasvainkudosta imply malignant tumor) means the answer here is "kyllä" (yes).

Now the tricky part is Gleason. The instructions say to report the worst lesion's result. The report has two macros: A and B. In macro A, the growth pattern is 4+3 with 60% dominant. In macro B, it's 4+5 with sum 9, which is higher. Since we need the worst lesion, which is the highest Gleason sum, that's 4+5=9. But wait, the example given in the problem uses the format "major+minor=sum". So for the worst lesion in macro B, major is 4, minor is 5, sum is 9. So the Gleason should be "4+5=9".

Wait, but sometimes Gleason scoring takes the highest grade first. Wait, no, the major pattern is the one with the highest percentage. Wait, in the report, for macro B: "kasvutapa 4+5, jossa osuudet n. 50% ja 20%." So the primary pattern is 4 (50%) and secondary is 5 (20%). So the Gleason sum is 4+5=9. So the correct format is "4+5=9".

But the example given in the problem was "4+3=7" where the primary is 4 and secondary 3. So the format is major+minor=sum. So in this case, the worst lesion is in macro B with 4+5=9. Therefore, the Gleason field should be "4+5=9".

So putting it all together:

Sampletype: RP (radikaali prostatektomia)
Malignancy: kyllä (malignant findings present)
Gleason: 4+5=9 (since that's the highest sum from the worst lesion)

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. The other blocks (C-J) are clean, but since A and B have malignancies, and B has the higher Gleason, that's the one to report.

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
