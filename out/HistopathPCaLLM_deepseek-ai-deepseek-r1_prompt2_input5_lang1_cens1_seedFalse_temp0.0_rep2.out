Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text, the first sentence mentions "Näytekappane on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." That translates to "The sample is originally from a relatively enlarged prostate." There's no mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about sections from left and right sides, apex and base, but doesn't specify the procedure type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" which means they can't reliably determine the major and minor Gleason grades. However, the presence of Gleason grading is typically for malignancy. But wait, the text also says "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" – suspected higher sum referred for further tests. But does that confirm malignancy? The key here is whether there's a confirmed malignancy. Since they couldn't reliably determine Gleason grades and it's just suspected, maybe the malignancy isn't confirmed. But the fact that they're trying to assess Gleason suggests there's malignancy. Wait, but the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't determine Gleason, maybe there's some uncertainty. However, the absence of a clear statement like "adenokarsinoomaa" (adenocarcinoma) might mean malignancy isn't confirmed. Hmm. The example given in the instructions had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, since they can't determine Gleason but are referring for further tests, maybe malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. But the question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – were there malignant findings. If they can't determine Gleason, maybe there's some malignancy but not enough to grade. Alternatively, maybe the presence of different architectures suggests malignancy. The text says "Erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan makrojen välissä" – different cell architectures observed between the macros. That could indicate malignancy. But I'm not sure. The example had "adenokarsinoomaa" leading to "kyllä". Here, if there's no explicit mention of cancer, maybe it's "ei" or "NA". Wait, the user instructions say for malignancy, if it's benign, then "ei", otherwise "kyllä" or "NA". If the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe it's "ei" or "NA". But the presence of Gleason grading attempts might imply malignancy. But since they couldn't determine it, maybe the answer is "kyllä" because they are trying to grade it, which is for cancer. Alternatively, maybe the answer is "ei" if no malignancy was found. This is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the text again. The report says "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" – suspected higher sum referred. So there's suspicion but not confirmation. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't confirm, maybe it's "ei" or "NA". But the example where Gleason was present but couldn't be determined might still have malignancy as "kyllä". Wait, in the example given by the user, when the text was nonsensical, all fields were NA. Here, the text is coherent but doesn't explicitly state malignancy. However, the fact that they are attempting to assess Gleason (even if not reliably) suggests that malignancy is present. Because Gleason grading is only done on cancerous tissue. So if they mention Gleason, even if they can't determine the exact grade, it implies malignancy. Therefore, Malignancy should be "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" if benign. Since they couldn't reliably determine the major and minor grades ("Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään"), the Gleason value should be "NA". Even though there's a mention of "epäilty suurempi summa", that's a suspected higher sum, but it's not a confirmed value. So the Gleason field is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure type isn't specified. Malignancy is "kyllä" because they attempted Gleason grading (implying cancer presence). Gleason is NA because the grades couldn't be reliably determined.
