Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathological report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text, the sample is described as coming from a "verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta" (a relatively enlarged prostate). The text mentions "näytteet" (samples) taken from both apex and basis, and processed in different colors. However, there's no explicit mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example given in the problem uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta", but here there's no such direct term. So maybe the sample type isn't specified, hence "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" (The major and minor Gleason grades cannot be reliably determined). But does that mean there's malignancy? The presence of Gleason grading attempts usually indicates cancer. However, the report also mentions "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten" (suspected higher sum referred to a colleague for further studies), which suggests suspicion but not confirmation. However, the absence of clear malignant findings (like adenokarsinooma) might mean malignancy is not confirmed. But the example shows that even if Gleason is mentioned, malignancy is "kyllä". Wait, in the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma with Gleason scores leads to "kyllä". Here, the text doesn't explicitly state malignancy, but the mention of Gleason grading attempts might imply that malignancy is suspected. However, since they couldn't reliably determine the grades, maybe the malignancy is uncertain. But according to the problem's instructions, if there's malignancy, report "kyllä", else "ei" or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, maybe "ei"? Or perhaps "NA"? Wait, the problem says "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state any malignancy, but mentions Gleason grading (which is for cancer), but they couldn't determine it, maybe it's ambiguous. However, in the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma leads to "kyllä". Here, there's no mention of cancer, just that Gleason couldn't be determined. So maybe malignancy is "ei" because no cancer is found, or "NA" if it's uncertain. But the problem says "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. Since they couldn't determine Gleason, maybe there's no confirmed malignancy. So "ei"? Or maybe the fact that they tried to assess Gleason implies malignancy is present but couldn't be graded. Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check the example again. In the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma leads to "kyllä". Here, if there's no mention of cancer, but they are trying to grade Gleason, perhaps there's suspicion but not confirmed. But according to the problem's instructions, only the worst lesion is considered. If there's no confirmed malignancy, then "ei". But maybe the answer is "kyllä" because they are attempting to grade, which is done for cancer. Wait, the text says "erilaisia soluarkkitehtuureja havaitaan" (various cell architectures observed), which could indicate cancerous changes. But it's not explicit. The example requires explicit mention. Since there's no explicit mention of cancer (like adenokarsinooma), maybe malignancy is "ei" or "NA". But the problem's instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If no malignant findings are reported, then "ei". The text doesn't state any malignancy, so "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The text says they couldn't reliably determine major and minor grades. So the Gleason would be "NA". 

Putting it all together: Sampletype is not specified (NA), malignancy is "ei" (no), Gleason is "NA".
