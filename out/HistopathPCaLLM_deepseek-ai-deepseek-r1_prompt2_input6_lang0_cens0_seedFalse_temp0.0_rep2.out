Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which I think stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes." The term "shaving chips" makes me think of TURP, as TURP often involves removing tissue in chips. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "benign prostate hyperplasia." Since benign is the opposite of malignant, and there's no mention of cancer or adenocarcinoma, Malignancy should be "no."

For Gleason grade, the guidelines say to use "NA" for benign cases. Since the diagnosis here is benign, there's no Gleason score reported. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. Need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON and that only the most severe lesion is considered, but in this case, there's no malignancy, so it's straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
