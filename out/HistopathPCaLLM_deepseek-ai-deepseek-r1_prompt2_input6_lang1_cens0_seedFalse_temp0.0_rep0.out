Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA if not specified. Looking at the input text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which is typical in a TURP procedure. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report mentions "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) and "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan" (slight prostatic hyperplasia). Hyperplasia is benign, and there's no mention of cancer or adenocarcinoma. So Malignancy is "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the value should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which aligns with the benign findings.

I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. In this case, since there's no malignancy, all fields except Sampletype are straightforward. Double-checking the terms to confirm no overlooked mentions of cancer or Gleason. The answer seems correct.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
