Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The given text mentions "höyläyslastuja," which translates to "shavings" or "chips." TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically produces such chips, so the sample type here is likely TURP.

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (normal prostate tissue) and mentions hyperplasia, which is benign. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. So malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei" or "NA," Gleason is "NA." The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, so that's confirmed.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei," and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values match the allowed options. No nested structures, just the three top-level fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to ensure I didn't miss any malignancy indicators. The key terms here are hyperplasia and no mention of cancer, so the answer should be accurate.

{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
