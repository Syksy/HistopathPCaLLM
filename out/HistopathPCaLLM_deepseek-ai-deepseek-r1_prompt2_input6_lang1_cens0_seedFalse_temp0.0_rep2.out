Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each step carefully.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The input text mentions "höyläyslastuja," which translates to "shavings" or "chips." TURP typically involves removing tissue chips, so I think TURP is the correct sample type here. The example given in the problem used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta," so the terminology seems direct. Since "höyläyslastuja" is associated with TURP procedures, I'll go with "TURP" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The report states that they found "suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (relatively normal prostate tissue) with some hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's mention of "polttoartefaktaa" (burn artifacts) which can complicate assessment, but no mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or malignancy. So the answer here should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example showed that if malignancy is "ei," Gleason is NA. The text here doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which reinforces that decision.

Let me double-check. The sample type is TURP because of the shavings. No malignancy indicators, just hyperplasia. No Gleason mentioned. So the JSON should be:

Sampletype: TURP
Malignancy: ei
Gleason: NA

I think that's correct. The key points are recognizing TURP from höyläyslastuja, no signs of cancer, and thus Gleason isn't applicable.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
