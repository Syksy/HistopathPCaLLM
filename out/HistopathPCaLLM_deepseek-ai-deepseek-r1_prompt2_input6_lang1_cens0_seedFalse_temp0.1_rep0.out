Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja..." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips," which makes me think of TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. Biopsy samples are usually small pieces, RP (Radical Prostatectomy) is the whole prostate, and TURP involves removing tissue chips. So Sampletype here is likely TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The text mentions "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (normal prostate tissue) with some hyperplasia. Hyperplasia is benign. There's no mention of cancer terms like adenokarsinooma or maligni. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, Gleason score would be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign finding.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON syntax is correct without nested structures and uses the specified keys and allowed values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
