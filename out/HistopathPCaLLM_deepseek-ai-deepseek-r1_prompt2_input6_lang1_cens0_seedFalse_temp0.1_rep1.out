Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "höyläyslastuja," which translates to "shavings" or "chips." In medical terms, TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often results in chip-like samples. Biopsy would be needle biopsies, and RP (radical prostatectomy) is a whole gland removal. Since the sample here is "höyläyslastuja," that's typical for TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP."

Next, malignancy. The report states "normaalia prostatasolukkoa" (normal prostate tissue) with some hyperplasia, which is benign. There's mention of "polttoartefaktaa" (burn artifacts) but no indication of cancer. So Malignancy is "ei" (no).

Gleason score is only reported if malignancy is present. Since there's no malignancy here, Gleason should be "NA."

Double-checking: No mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. Hyperplasia is benign. Sample type is TURP. All criteria fit. So the JSON should reflect these values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
