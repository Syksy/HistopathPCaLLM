Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. The input is a free-text report, and I need to parse it according to the given rules.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteinä yhteensä 4g höyläyslastuja, jotka käynnistetty kolmeen kudoskasettiin." The term "höyläyslastuja" translates to "shavings" or "chips", which is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. However, sometimes "höyläys" might refer to a biopsy. But TURP is a specific procedure where tissue is shaved off, so I think "TURP" is the correct sample type here. Wait, but the example given in the instructions had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "biopsiasta". Let me check again. The sample here is "höyläyslastuja", which are chips from a resection. TURP is a type of resection, so the sample type should be "TURP". But I need to confirm if "höyläyslastuja" is indeed TURP. Yes, TURP samples are typically chips or shavings, so Sampletype is "TURP".

Next, determining malignancy. The text states: "Todetaan mikroskooppisesti suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa... löydökset viittaisivat hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan." Hyperplasia is benign, not malignant. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant terms. The report mentions "normaalia" (normal) and "hyperplasiaan" (hyperplasia), which are benign. So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score: Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is "TURP", Malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". I need to ensure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. Since there's no malignancy, all criteria are met.

  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
