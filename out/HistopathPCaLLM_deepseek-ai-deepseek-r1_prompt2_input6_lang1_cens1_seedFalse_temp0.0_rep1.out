Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia", which translates to prostate treatment material. However, the original sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions the samples are fragmented and processed in three batches, but there's no specific mention of the procedure type. So, Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states: "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa..." which means they observed relatively normal prostate tissue. However, it also mentions that most of the material couldn't be examined properly due to burning artifacts, leading to unclear results. Since there's no mention of malignancy detected and the findings are inconclusive, but the normal tissue is noted, I think Malignancy should be "ei" (no). But wait, the presence of normal tissue doesn't necessarily rule out malignancy if other areas couldn't be assessed. However, the report says the results are unclear and recommends re-examination. Since no malignancy is explicitly found, and the majority couldn't be assessed, maybe "ei" is appropriate. Alternatively, if the uncertainty means we can't confirm, maybe "NA". Hmm. The example given in the problem had "kyllä" when cancer was found, "ei" if benign, and "NA" if unclear. Here, the results are unclear due to artifacts, so maybe Malignancy should be "NA" because they can't determine it properly. The text says "Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät" (results are unclear), so even though they saw normal tissue, the majority couldn't be assessed. So, it's not confirmed as benign or malignant. Hence, Malignancy is "NA".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "NA" here, Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a mention of Gleason, if malignancy isn't confirmed, it's still "NA". The text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because results are unclear. Gleason is NA as no score is given and malignancy isn't confirmed.
