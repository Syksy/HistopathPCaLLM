Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Näytteet koostuvat erittäin fragmentoituneista osista alkuperäistä prostata-käsittelymateriaalia." The key term here is "prostata-käsittelymateriaalia", which translates to prostate treatment material. The sample is described as fragmented, but there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions the samples are processed in three batches, but that doesn't specify the type. Since the original type isn't clearly stated, I should go with "NA" for the sample type.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says "Mikroskooppisesti nähdään verrattain normaalia prostatasolukkoa" which means microscopically normal prostate tissue. However, it also mentions that most of the material can't be examined properly due to burn artifacts ("valtaosaa näytemateriaalista ei voida tutkia riittävän tarkasti johtuen vahvasta polttoartefaktasta"). Since the results are unclear ("Tulokset ovat siten epäselvät") and they recommend re-examination, there's no definitive evidence of malignancy. But the presence of normal tissue doesn't confirm malignancy either. The report doesn't explicitly state finding cancer, so maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the instructions say if there are no malignant findings, then Gleason is NA. But in this case, the results are unclear. The user's example for unclear reports uses "NA" for malignancy. Since the malignancy can't be determined due to technical issues, the correct value here should be "NA".

Third, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "NA" here, the Gleason should also be "NA". Even if there was a mention of Gleason in the text, but in this case, there's no mention of any cancer or Gleason scores. The report is inconclusive, so definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the original type isn't specified, malignancy is NA because the results are unclear, and Gleason is NA accordingly.
