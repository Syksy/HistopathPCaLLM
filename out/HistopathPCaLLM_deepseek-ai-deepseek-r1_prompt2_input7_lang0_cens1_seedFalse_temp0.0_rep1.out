Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected..." There's no mention of the specific procedure like biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but says "no definite conclusions could be drawn." Since it's uncertain and there's no clear mention of malignancy, the answer here is "no" or maybe "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says they couldn't draw definite conclusions, so it's not confirmed as malignant. But does "atypical structures" imply suspicion? The example given in the problem where a similar situation (atypical but no conclusion) would be "no" or "NA"? The example provided in the problem for an invalid statement uses NA for malignancy. However, in the example where it's a valid statement but no malignancy, like if the text says no malignancy, then "no". Here, the text says "no definite conclusions" but mentions atypical structures. Since it's not confirmed, maybe "no" because the presence isn't confirmed. Alternatively, if the presence is uncertain, maybe NA. But according to the problem's example, when the statement is invalid, all are NA. But here, the statement is valid but inconclusive. The key is whether the system can determine malignancy. Since they couldn't draw conclusions, it's not confirmed as malignant, so Malignancy should be "no"? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? Hmm. The example given in the problem where the statement is valid but no malignancy would have "no". For instance, if the text says "no malignancy found", then "no". But here, it's inconclusive. The problem's instructions say: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". Since the most severe here is "atypical structures" but no definite conclusions, maybe it's considered not malignant. So Malignancy is "no".

Third, Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of Gleason scores and malignancy is "no", Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (no specific procedure mentioned), Malignancy is "no" (since no definite malignancy found), and Gleason is NA.
