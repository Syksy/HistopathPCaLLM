Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected..." It mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the method. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says there's a point of interest with atypical structures and morphological changes, but it's diminishingly small and no definite conclusions could be drawn. The key here is "no definite conclusions." Since they can't confirm malignancy, Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? Wait, the allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The example given for an inconclusive case used NA for Malignancy. In the example where no definite conclusions were drawn, they used NA. So here, since it's uncertain, Malignancy should be NA.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The statement doesn't mention any Gleason scores or grades. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and no Gleason reported, this should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. The example provided for an unclear case also returns all NAs, so this fits.
