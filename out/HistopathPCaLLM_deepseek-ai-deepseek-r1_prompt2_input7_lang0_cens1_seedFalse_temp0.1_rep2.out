Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected..." The text mentions "prostate sample material" but doesn't specify the type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. So, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but states "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and the rest of the material was typical. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and it's inconclusive, Malignancy should be NA. It's not a clear yes or no.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example uses the format "major+minor=sum". The given text doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. There's a reference to atypical structures but no specific grades. So, Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together, all three fields would be NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and there's no Gleason grade mentioned. The example provided for an inconclusive case also uses NA for all fields, which matches this scenario.
