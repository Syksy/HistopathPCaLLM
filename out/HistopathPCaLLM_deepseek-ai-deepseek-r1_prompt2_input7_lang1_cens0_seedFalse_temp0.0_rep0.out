Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which is Finnish for prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, assessing malignancy. The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so scant that it remains a suspicion, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The other samples show normal tissue. The key here is whether malignancy is confirmed. Since it's only a suspicion and not definitive, the answer here should be "ei" (no) because there's no clear malignancy detected. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, "ei" is appropriate.

For Gleason score, the rule is to report it as "major+minor=sum" if malignancy is present, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy wasn't confirmed (answer is "ei"), the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided helps confirm the format. The given text doesn't mention any Gleason scores, so that's another reason to put NA there.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
