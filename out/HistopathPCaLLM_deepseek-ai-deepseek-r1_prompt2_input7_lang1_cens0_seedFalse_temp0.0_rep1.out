Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the first line mentions "prostatabiopsiat" which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report says there's a focus with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's too scant to confirm. The exact phrase is "jää suspisio-asteelle, eikä selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" which means it's suspicious but no clear adenocarcinoma is found. Since there's no definitive malignancy, the answer here should be "ei" (no). Even though there's suspicion, the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed, so according to the rules, it's "ei".

For Gleason score, the format is major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be NA. The report doesn't mention any Gleason scores either, which reinforces that.

So putting it all together: sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Need to make sure the JSON keys are correct and the values are as per allowed options. No nested structures, just the three fields. Let me double-check the Finnish terms to confirm. Yep, "prostatabiopsiat" is plural but the sampletype is "biopsy". The malignancy part is correctly assessed as negative because there's no definitive diagnosis. Gleason isn't applicable here. All set.
