Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which clearly translates to biopsy. So the sample type should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that there's a focus with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so minimal that it remains a suspicion, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The key phrases here are "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found). Since there's suspicion but no definitive malignancy, I need to decide if "kyllä" applies. However, the instructions say to report only the worst lesion. Since it's not confirmed, maybe "ei" is more appropriate. But wait, the presence of atypia and suspicion might complicate things. However, the explicit statement that no clear adenocarcinoma was found suggests malignancy is not confirmed. So "ei" for malignancy.

Lastly, Gleason grade. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even though there's a mention of "gradusen suhteellisen turp grade" in the example, in this specific case, since adenocarcinoma isn't confirmed, there's no Gleason reported here. The example given in the problem where Gleason is present is when malignancy is confirmed. Here, it's not, so "NA".

Putting it all together: sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA.
