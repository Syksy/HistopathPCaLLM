Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. That's straightforward; Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so minimal that it remains a suspicion, and no clear adenocarcinoma was found. The key phrases here are "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found). Since there's suspicion but no definitive malignancy, does that count as malignant? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. However, since it's not confirmed and the conclusion is that no clear cancer was found, the malignancy should be "ei". But wait, the example given in the problem had a case where even a suspicion might lead to "kyllä"? Let me check the example again. In the example, the presence of adenocarcinoma was confirmed, so malignancy was "kyllä". Here, the report says that the findings are so minimal that it's only a suspicion and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. Therefore, malignancy should be "ei" because there's no definitive diagnosis of cancer. So Malignancy is "ei".

Lastly, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a mention of a Gleason score, if the malignancy is negative, we put "NA". In this text, there's no mention of Gleason grades at all. So definitely "NA" for Gleason.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is no, Gleason is NA. Let me double-check the text again to make sure I didn't miss any Gleason mention. Scanning through, the words "Gleason" or any numbers with plus signs (like 3+4) aren't present. So yes, Gleason remains NA.
