Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each one carefully.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatabiopsiat". The Finnish word "biopsiat" translates to biopsies, so the sample type here is clearly a biopsy. So Sampletype should be "biopsy".

Next, determining Malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with some features that might indicate adenocarcinoma, but it's so scant that it remains a suspicion, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The key phrases here are "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found). Since there's a suspicion but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, does that count as malignant? The instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. However, since it's not confirmed, the malignancy isn't definitively present. The answer here might be "ei" because there's no clear malignancy detected. But wait, the example given in the problem had a case where adenocarcinoma was mentioned, even if suspected, and the malignancy was marked as "kyllä". Wait, no, in the example provided by the user, the first example had a clear detection: "havaitaan adenokarsinoomaa". In the second example, which was not a valid report, malignancy was NA. In this case, the current report says "suspisio-asteelle" but no clear adenocarcinoma. So according to the problem's logic, if there's no definitive malignancy, then malignancy is "ei". But I need to be careful. The question is: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä?" (Were there malignant findings in the sample?) If the findings are suspicious but not confirmed, does that count as malignant? The answer is probably "ei" because the report states that no clear adenocarcinoma was found. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Third, the Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA". Even if there was a suspicion, unless malignancy is confirmed, Gleason isn't reported. The example given in the problem shows that when malignancy is "kyllä", Gleason is reported, otherwise "NA". So here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: biopsy (because "prostatabiopsiat")
Malignancy: ei (no clear malignancy found)
Gleason: NA (since no malignancy)
