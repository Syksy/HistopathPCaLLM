Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the first sentence mentions "prostatabiopsiat", which translates to prostate biopsies. So the sample type should be "biopsy". That's straightforward.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states that in sample 1B, there's a focus with some features that might suggest adenocarcinoma, but it's so scant that it remains a suspicion, and no clear adenocarcinoma is found. The key phrases here are "suspisio-asteelle" (suspicion level) and "ei selvää adenokarsinoomaa löydetä" (no clear adenocarcinoma found). Since malignancy requires confirmation, and the report doesn't confirm it, the answer here should be "ei". Even though there's suspicion, the presence isn't confirmed, so malignancy is "no".

Lastly, the Gleason score. The format should be "major+minor=sum" if malignant, otherwise "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", the Gleason score should be "NA". Additionally, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades or scores, which reinforces that decision.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. All three fields are top-level. The example provided uses "biopsy", "kyllä", and "4+3=7" when there's a confirmed malignancy with Gleason. Here, since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Double-checking the sample type: "prostatabiopsiat" clearly indicates biopsy. Malignancy: no clear cancer found, just suspicion. Gleason: not applicable. So the final JSON should have "biopsy", "ei", and "NA".

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
