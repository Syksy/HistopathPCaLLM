Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the given text: "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The term "prostatanäytemateriaalia" translates to prostate sample material. However, the text doesn't specify whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. It just mentions that a sufficient amount was collected routinely. So there's no clear indication of the sample type. Therefore, Sampletype should be NA.

Next, assessing malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The text mentions "Yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia." Atyyppisia means atypical, which could suggest something suspicious. However, it goes on to say that the finding was very small ("häviävän pieni") and no definitive conclusion could be made ("mitään definitiittiä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä"). The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, and the atypical findings are inconclusive, Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, or NA. The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but does it say there are malignant findings? The key here is whether malignant (pahanlaatuinen) findings are present. The text mentions atypical structures but no definitive conclusion. Since it's uncertain, maybe Malignancy should be NA. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, and the rest is normal, then there's no confirmed malignancy. So Malignancy would be "ei". But wait, the example given in the problem where the report was unclear had Malignancy as NA. Let me check the example again. In the example of the nonsensical report, all fields were NA. But in the first example, when malignancy was present, it was "kyllä". Here, the report mentions atypical findings but no definitive conclusion. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe the answer is "ei"? Or is it NA because it's uncertain? The user's instructions say "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" – so if the report says they couldn't determine, then maybe it's NA. But the example where the report was unclear used NA. However, in this case, the report says that the rest of the material was typical, and the atypical was too small. So perhaps the conclusion is that there are no malignant findings, hence "ei". Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The presence of atypical structures might suggest suspicion, but since it's inconclusive and no definitive malignancy is found, the answer should be "ei" because the question is whether there were malignant findings. If they can't confirm, then the answer is "ei". Alternatively, if the report doesn't state malignancy, then it's "ei". So I'll go with "ei".

Lastly, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since we determined Malignancy as "ei", then Gleason should be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason in the text, but in this case, there isn't. The text doesn't mention Gleason at all. So Gleason is definitely NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, Malignancy is "ei" because no definitive malignancy was found, and Gleason is NA.
