Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The example given was "Prostata biopsiasta..." which became "biopsy". Looking at the current report: "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The key word here is "prostatanäytemateriaalia", which translates to prostate sample material. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The example used "biopsiasta" to determine "biopsy", but here there's no such specific term. So maybe the sample type is "NA" here.

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia" (atypical structures and morphological changes), but it's noted as very small and no definitive conclusion could be made. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, and the example where malignancy was present used clear terms like "adenokarsinoomaa", here it's uncertain. The instructions say to answer "kyllä" only if there are malignant findings. Since it's inconclusive, maybe "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the example where malignancy was present had a clear diagnosis. Here, the report says "mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" (no definitive conclusion). So malignancy isn't confirmed. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". Since it's uncertain, but there were atypical findings, but not enough to confirm malignancy. The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they couldn't confirm, maybe "ei" (no) or "NA"? The example where malignancy was "kyllä" had a clear adenocarcinoma. Here, since it's inconclusive, perhaps "ei" (assuming that "ei" means no malignancy found) or "NA" if the presence is uncertain. But the report says "loppujen lopuksi mitään definitiittiä johtopäätöstä... ei voitu tehdä" which suggests that malignancy wasn't confirmed, so maybe "ei" (no) or "NA". The example given for an unclear report used "NA" for malignancy. Wait, in the example where the text was nonsensical, all fields were "NA". Here, the report is structured but inconclusive. The key is whether there are malignant findings. The presence of atypical structures might suggest suspicion, but since it's not definitive, perhaps "ei" (no) or "NA". The instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If they can't confirm, then maybe "ei" (no) because the final conclusion is that no malignancy was found. Wait, the report says "loput materiaalista esittivät tyypillisiä odotettuja rakenteita" (the rest showed typical structures). The main finding was "kiinnostava löydös" with atypia, but too small to make a definitive conclusion. So the malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, "Malignancy" should be "ei" (no) because there's no definitive malignancy reported. But wait, the example where malignancy was present had a clear "adenokarsinoomaa". Here, the presence of atypia but no definitive diagnosis. The question is whether "atyyppisia rakenteita" counts as malignant. Atypia can be a precursor or uncertain, but not necessarily malignant. Since the report doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "ei". Alternatively, if the presence of any atypia (even if inconclusive) is considered as possible malignancy, but the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the report doesn't state malignancy, then "ei". But maybe the answer is "ei" because the final conclusion is that no definitive malignancy was found. So "Malignancy": "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei" here, Gleason should be "NA".

Sampletype: The report mentions "prostatanäytemateriaalia" but doesn't specify biopsy, RP, or TURP. So "NA".

So the final JSON would be:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but in the example, when the text was nonsensical, all were "NA". Here, the malignancy is "ei" because no malignancy was found. But the report mentions atypical findings. Let me check the instructions again. The second question is "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (Were there malignant findings in the sample). If the sample has atypical cells but no definitive malignancy, then the answer is "ei". Because "pahanlaatuisia" means malignant. So if the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion, then the answer is "ei" (no malignant findings). Therefore, the JSON is correct as above.
