Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The input text is a free-form report, and I need to determine the sample type, presence of malignancy, and Gleason score.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given report: "Riittävä määrä prostatanäytemateriaalia kerättiin rutiinisti annettujen ohjeiden mukaisesti." The key word here is "prostatanäytemateriaalia", which translates to prostate sample material. However, the report doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample. Terms like "biopsia" (biopsy), "radikaaliprostatektomia" (RP), or "TURP" (transurethral resection) are not present. So the sample type isn't specified here. Therefore, "Sampletype" should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "Yhdessä näytteessä nousi esiin kiinnostava löydös, jossa atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia." Atyypisia rakenteita (atypical structures) and morphologic changes can be suspicious, but the text continues: "Löydös oli kuitenkin niin häviävän pieni, että mitään definitiiviä johtopäätöstä ei voitu tehdä." So the finding was too small to make a definitive conclusion. The rest of the material showed typical structures. Since there's no definitive malignancy reported, and the atypical findings are inconclusive, the malignancy status can't be confirmed. Therefore, "Malignancy" should be "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report doesn't confirm malignancy, but there's an inconclusive finding. However, since the conclusion is that no definitive diagnosis could be made, and the rest is normal, maybe "ei" is appropriate. But maybe the presence of atypical cells might be considered as possible malignancy, but since it's not confirmed, perhaps "NA" is safer. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no definitive malignancy, even if there's atypia, which isn't necessarily malignant, then "ei" would be correct. Because the question is whether there were malignant findings, not suspicious. So if the report says they couldn't make a definitive conclusion and the rest was normal, then malignancy is "ei".

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else "NA". Since malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA (not specified), Malignancy is "ei" (no), Gleason is NA.
