Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, Sample 3 is described as a "radical prostatectomy preparate." So that should be RP. The other samples are lymph nodes, but the key here is the third sample, which is the radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype is RP.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The report mentions "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" in sample 3, which is the radical prostatectomy. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy (0/6), but the main lesion here is the prostate sample. Since tumor tissue is present, Malignancy should be yes.

For Gleason grade, the format should be major+minor=sum. The report states "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7." Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So Gleason is "4+3=7".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion is considered. The radical prostatectomy sample is the primary one here with malignancy and Gleason score. The lymph nodes are negative, but that's secondary. So the answer should reflect the third sample's findings.
