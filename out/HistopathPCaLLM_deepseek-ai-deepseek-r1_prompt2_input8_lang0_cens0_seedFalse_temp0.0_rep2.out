Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as a "radical prostatectomy preparate". That clearly points to RP as the sample type. The other samples are lymph nodes, but the most severe lesion is in Sample 3, so Sampletype should be RP.

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text states that in Sample 3, "tumor tissue is observed" with invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion is malignant. So Malignancy should be yes.

For Gleason, the format should be major+minor=sum. The report mentions "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since Sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the highest Gleason score, that's the one to use. The other samples (lymph nodes) don't affect the main three fields here. The answer should be in JSON without nested structures. Let me double-check the example given to ensure the format is correct. Yes, the example uses "4+3=7" directly. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as yes, and Gleason as 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
