Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants structured data from the provided medical text. The three fields to extract are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as a radical prostatectomy preparate. So that should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are yes, no, or NA. The text says "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and mentions invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main sample (Sample 3) has tumor tissue. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For Gleason, the highest identified is 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

Need to make sure we're only taking the most severe lesion's data. The main sample here is Sample 3, which has the malignant findings and the Gleason score. The lymph nodes are negative, but the primary sample is the prostatectomy. So all answers should come from Sample 3.

Double-checking the example given. The sample type here is RP, which matches "radical prostatectomy preparate". Malignancy is yes because tumor tissue is present. Gleason is the highest mentioned, 4+3=7. The other details like lower grade 30% don't affect the Gleason field since we take the highest sum. 

No nested structures, just the three fields. So the JSON should be straightforward.
