Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a medical text about prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (which stands for radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, Sample 3 is mentioned as a radical prostatectomy preparate. So that should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The statement says "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and mentions invasive properties. Also, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main sample (Sample 3) has tumor tissue. So Malignancy should be "yes".

For the Gleason grade, the highest identified is 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is what's needed. So Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure only the most severe lesion's data is used. Since Sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the highest Gleason, that's the one to report. The other samples (lymph nodes) don't affect the main malignancy here. The JSON should have Sampletype as "RP", Malignancy "yes", and Gleason "4+3=7".

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
