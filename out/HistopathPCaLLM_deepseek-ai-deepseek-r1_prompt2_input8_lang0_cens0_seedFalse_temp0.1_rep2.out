Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a histopathology report related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason.

First, the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the provided statement, Sample 3 is described as a "radical prostatectomy preparate." So that should be RP. The other samples are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is Sample 3, which is the radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype is RP.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there were malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes" and describes invasive properties. Additionally, the lymph nodes are free from malignancy, but the main lesion (Sample 3) has tumor tissue. So Malignancy should be "yes."

For Gleason grade, the highest identified is 4+3=7. The example given uses the format "major+minor=sum," so even though the text mentions the lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest is 4+3=7. So Gleason should be "4+3=7."

I need to make sure that only the most severe lesion is considered. Since Sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the tumor with Gleason 7, that's the one to report. The lymph nodes are negative, but the main sample is malignant. So the JSON should reflect Sampletype as RP, Malignancy yes, and Gleason 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
