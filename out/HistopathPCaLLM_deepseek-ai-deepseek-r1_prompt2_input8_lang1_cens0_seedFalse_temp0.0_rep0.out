Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason grade. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radikaaliprostatetomia), TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin..." So Sampletype for the third sample is RP. Since the instruction says to take the worst lesion's results, and sample 3 is the one with malignancy, the Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The report states "Löydetty korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7" which indicates malignancy. Also, the imusolmukkeet (lymph nodes) didn't have malignant findings, but the main sample (näyte 3) does. So Malignancy is "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the text explicitly mentions "4+3=7". The format should be "major+minor=sum", so "4+3=7" is correct. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7, so that's the one to use.

I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the three fields. The example provided uses "kyllä" for malignancy when present, so that's the correct value here. The sample type is clearly RP from the radikaaliprostatetomia mention. Gleason is straightforward as given. No issues with other parts of the text contradicting these findings.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
