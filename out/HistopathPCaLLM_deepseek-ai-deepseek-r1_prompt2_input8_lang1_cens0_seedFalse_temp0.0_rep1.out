Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the given text step by step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radikaaliprostatetomia), TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin..." So sample 3 is from a radical prostatectomy, which is RP. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes, but the main sample here is 3. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "Näytteessä 3 havaitaan molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta..." which translates to tumor tissue found, and also "Löydetty korkein Gleason kasvutapa..." which is a Gleason score, indicating malignancy. Additionally, the lymph nodes (samples 1 and 2) have no malignancy: "Tutkituissa imusolmukkeissa ei kuitenkaan maligneja löydöksiä (0/6)." But since the main sample (3) is malignant, the answer here is "kyllä".

Third, Gleason grade. The highest reported is "4+3=7". The note about the lower grade 3 being 30% might refer to the minor component, but the instruction says to take the worst lesion's result. So the Gleason should be "4+3=7".

I need to make sure that the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst findings. The example given uses the major+minor=sum format. Also, since malignancy is present, Gleason isn't NA. So the final JSON should have Sampletype as RP, Malignancy as kyllä, and Gleason as 4+3=7.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
