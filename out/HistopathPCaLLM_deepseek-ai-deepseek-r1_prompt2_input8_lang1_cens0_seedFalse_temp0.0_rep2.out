Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields are sample type, malignancy presence, and Gleason grade. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin..." Radikaaliprostatektomia is RP, so sample type for the worst lesion (which is sample 3) is RP.

Next, malignancy. The question is whether there are malignant findings. The text mentions "näytteessä 3 havaitaan molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta..." Kasvainkudosta (tumor tissue) implies malignancy. Also, the Gleason score is given, which is for cancer. So malignancy is "kyllä".

Gleason grade: The text states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". So the highest (worst) is 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, we take the highest. So Gleason is "4+3=7".

Imusolmukkeet (lymph nodes) are mentioned as having no malignancy (0/6), but since the worst lesion is in sample 3, which is malignant, those don't affect the malignancy field. 

So the JSON should be:
Sampletype: RP
Malignancy: kyllä
Gleason: 4+3=7
</think>

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
