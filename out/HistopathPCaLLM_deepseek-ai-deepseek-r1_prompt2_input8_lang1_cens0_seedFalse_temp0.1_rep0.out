Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of prostate cancer. The output needs to be in JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's break down each part.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the relevant part is "Näyte 3 sisältää radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". "Radikaaliprostatetomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype here should be "RP".

Next, Malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report mentions "Näytteessä 3 havaitaan molemmissa lohkoissa kasvainkudosta" which indicates malignant tissue (kasvainkudosta = tumor tissue). Also, the Gleason score is provided, which is typically for malignancies. So Malignancy should be "kyllä".

For Gleason, the format is "major+minor=sum". The text states "Löydetty korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". So the Gleason score here is 4+3=7. Even though there's a mention of a lower grade (alemman luokan 3 osuus n. 30%), the instruction says to take the highest (pahimman leesion) result. So we use 4+3=7.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the highest Gleason is reported. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes without malignancy, but Sample 3 is the main one here. The lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) are negative, but Sample 3 is the prostatectomy with malignancy. So the final JSON should reflect Sample 3's data.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
