Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON format with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to identify the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the third sample (Näyte 3) mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatti". "Radikaaliprostatetomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, determining malignancy. The options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) which is invasive. Additionally, Gleason 4+3=7 is mentioned, which is a malignant finding. However, the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) have no malignancy (0/6). But the question is about the presence of malignant findings in the sample. Since the main sample (sample 3) has malignancy, the answer here should be "kyllä".

For Gleason grade, the format is "major+minor=sum". The text explicitly states "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion's results are reported. Since sample 3 is the radical prostatectomy and has the highest Gleason score, that's the one to use. The other samples (1 and 2) are lymph nodes without malignancy, but they aren't the primary sample here. The JSON should not have nested structures, just the three fields with the appropriate values.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
