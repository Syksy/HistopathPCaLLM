Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text, the third sample mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian preparaatin". "Radikaaliprostatektomia" translates to radical prostatectomy, which is abbreviated as RP. So Sampletype should be "RP".

Next, check for malignancy. The report states that in sample 3, there's "kasvainkudosta" (tumor tissue) which is invasive. Also, the Gleason score is given. However, the lymph nodes (imusolmukkeet) don't show malignancy (0/6). But the main sample (sample 3) does have malignant findings. So Malignancy is "kyllä" (yes).

For Gleason, the text explicitly mentions "korkein Gleason kasvutapa on 4+3=7". Even though there's a mention of lower grade 3 being 30%, the highest reported is 4+3=7. So the Gleason field should be "4+3=7".

I need to ensure that only the worst lesion is considered, which in this case is the 4+3=7. The other details like PIN changes or lower grade components don't affect the Gleason field as we take the highest sum.

Double-checking each part: Sampletype is RP, malignancy is yes, Gleason is 4+3=7. All other info like lymph nodes being negative doesn't override the main sample's findings. The JSON structure should have these values without nesting.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
