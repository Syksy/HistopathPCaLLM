Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "näytteet" which is Finnish for samples. The report mentions "Prostatabiopsioita" in the example, but in the given input, the samples are numbered 1, 2, and 3. The third sample is part of the prostate tissue being examined. The term "biopsiasta" would indicate biopsy, but here the samples are just numbered. However, the example provided in the instructions uses "biopsy" when the text mentions "Prostata biopsiasta". In the current case, the samples are labeled numerically, but the type isn't explicitly stated. However, the third sample is processed according to routine protocol, which might be a biopsy. But without clear terms like "biopsia", "RP", or "TURP", it's safer to mark Sampletype as NA.

Next, malignancy. The report states that samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has some interesting features but mentions that the highest Gleason grade is missing, possibly a clerical error. However, the key point is whether there are any malignant findings. Since samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed (only suspected but with missing data), the overall malignancy would be "ei" (no) because the only confirmed samples (1 and 2) are benign. But wait, the third sample's status is unclear. The text says "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) but doesn't confirm malignancy. Also, the highest Gleason is missing. So, since the only confirmed samples are non-malignant, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed, the answer should be "ei".

For Gleason grade: The text mentions that the highest identified Gleason class seems to be missing, with question marks in major and minor. It also states that a lower grade covered about 10% but the actual grade value is missing, possibly a clerical error. Since there's no clear Gleason score provided (just placeholders or missing data), and the malignancy is "ei", the Gleason should be "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified, malignancy is "ei" because samples 1 and 2 are free and sample 3 is uncertain, and Gleason is NA due to missing data.
