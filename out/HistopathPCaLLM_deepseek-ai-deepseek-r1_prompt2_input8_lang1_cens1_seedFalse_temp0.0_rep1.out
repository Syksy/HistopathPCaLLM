Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three specific fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The original text mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3". The third sample is from the prostate, but the report doesn't explicitly state the procedure type. However, since samples 1 and 2 are mentioned without a specific procedure, and sample 3 is part of routine protocol, it's unclear. The example used "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, there's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So Sampletype should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The text says samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies). Sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) but mentions "matalempi grade" (lower grade) and "kirjausvirhe" (recording error). However, the highest Gleason is missing, and there's suspicion of PIN changes, which are not malignant. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's findings are uncertain without confirmed malignancy, overall malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason, the report states "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason missing) with question marks in major and minor. There's a mention of lower grade covering 10%, but no actual values. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason should be "NA".

So the JSON should have all fields as "NA" except Malignancy as "ei". Wait, but the user instructions say to consider the worst lesion. Samples 1 and 2 are benign, sample 3's malignancy is unclear. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, but sample 3's status isn't clearly malignant. Since the worst is benign, Malignancy is "ei". Therefore, the correct JSON is Sampletype NA, Malignancy ei, Gleason NA.

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
