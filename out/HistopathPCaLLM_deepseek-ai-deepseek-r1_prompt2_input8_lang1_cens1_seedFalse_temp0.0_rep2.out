Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report on prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let me go through each of them one by one based on the provided text.

First, the Sampletype. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the text, the samples are referred to as "näytteet" which translates to samples. The report mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" (Numbered samples 1 and 2) and "Näyte 3" (Sample 3). The third sample is part of the prostate tissue being examined. The text also mentions "prostatabiopsioita" which I think is a typo or variant of "prostatan biopsia" (prostate biopsy). However, in the example given, "biopsy" is "biopsia" in Finnish. But in the current report, the samples are labeled as 1, 2, and 3. The third sample is processed according to routine protocol. The term "biopsia" isn't explicitly used here. Wait, the example given in the problem had "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Here, the samples are just numbered. However, the last line says "Numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita." So samples 1 and 2 are free of malignancy, but sample 3's type isn't explicitly stated. The report might be from a biopsy procedure, but the text doesn't specify. The user might need to infer. Alternatively, if the sample type isn't clear, it should be NA. But the third sample is part of the prostate tissue, but the original sample type isn't mentioned. So maybe the Sampletype is NA here.

Second, Malignancy. The allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says that samples 1 and 2 are "maligniteeteista vapaita" (free of malignancies), but sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features). However, the highest Gleason grade is missing, and there's a mention of a lower grade covering about 10% of the sample, but the actual grade value is missing, possibly a recording error. The key point is whether there's malignancy. The third sample's analysis mentions "immunologinen aktiviteetti" and possible inflammation, but it's unclear if malignancy is present. The report also mentions suspicion of PIN changes (which are pre-cancerous), but not confirmed malignancy. Since samples 1 and 2 are free, but sample 3's malignancy isn't clearly stated. However, the user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion. If sample 3 has some suspicion but no confirmed malignancy, then maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because the samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive. Wait, but the problem states to take the worst lesion. Let me check again. The third sample's description: "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features), "vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja" (varying growth patterns), and "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest identified Gleason grade seems to be missing). There's a mention of a lower grade covering 10%, but the grade value is missing. Also, "epäilykset PIN-muutoksista" (suspicions of PIN changes). PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is a pre-malignant condition. So, if there's no confirmed malignancy in any sample, then Malignancy would be "ei". But samples 1 and 2 are free, and sample 3's findings are uncertain. So the answer here is "ei" because no definite malignancy is reported.

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the malignancy is "ei", then Gleason should be NA. However, the third sample mentions "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason grade missing), with a table marked with ? and ? for major and minor. There's a mention of a lower grade covering 10%, but the actual value is missing. Since the malignancy is considered "ei" (no), then Gleason is NA. But wait, if there's a Gleason mentioned but incomplete, does that count? The instructions say to report Gleason only for malignant cases. Since the malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Even though there's a mention of Gleason components, but they are incomplete and possibly a recording error. So the correct entry is NA.

Putting it all together:

Sampletype: The text doesn't explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so NA.

Malignancy: The worst lesion is in sample 3, but it's not confirmed as malignant, so "ei".

Gleason: Since malignancy is "ei", NA.
