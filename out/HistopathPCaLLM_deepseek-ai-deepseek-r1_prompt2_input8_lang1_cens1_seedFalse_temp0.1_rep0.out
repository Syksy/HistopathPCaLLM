Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3" which are numbered samples. The third sample is part of the prostate tissue being examined. The report talks about "prostatasolukosta" (prostate tissue) and mentions "normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti" (normal routine protocol). But there's no explicit mention of the sample type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection). So maybe the sample type isn't specified here. The example given where it's NA had unclear terms too. So I'll put "NA" for Sampletype.

Next, malignancy. The allowed values are kyllä, ei, or NA. The text says "Numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita." So samples 1 and 2 are free of malignancy. But sample 3 has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia" (possibly interesting features) but mentions "korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" (highest Gleason grade seems missing) and "matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä" (lower grade covered about 10% of the sample). However, the malignancy determination: samples 1 and 2 are benign, but sample 3's status isn't clearly stated as malignant. The user instructions say to consider only the worst lesion. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's malignancy is uncertain (they mention possible features but no confirmed malignancy, and Gleason is missing due to possible entry error), maybe the malignancy is "ei" because the worst sample (3) isn't confirmed as malignant. Wait, but the example where Gleason was present but the sample was unclear still had malignancy as "kyllä". Here, sample 3's Gleason is missing, but there's a mention of lower grade covering 10%. However, the report says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for samples 1 and 2, but sample 3's status is unclear. Since the worst lesion is considered, and sample 3's malignancy isn't confirmed, maybe malignancy is "ei"? Or is there any mention of malignancy in sample 3? Let me check again. The text says "immunologinen aktiviteetti on erittäin ilmeistä ja normaaleja tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia epäillään" (immunological activity is evident and normal inflammation-related changes are suspected). Also, "PIN-muutoksista" (PIN changes) which are pre-cancerous but not malignant. So maybe overall, the malignancy is "ei" because the worst samples (1 and 2) are free, and sample 3's findings are inconclusive. So Malignancy would be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The format is "major+minor=sum" or NA if benign. Since the worst samples (1 and 2) are benign, and sample 3's Gleason is missing ("korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan... itse graden arvo puuttuu"), there's no valid Gleason reported. So Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because it's not specified, malignancy is "ei" because the worst samples are benign, and Gleason is NA.
