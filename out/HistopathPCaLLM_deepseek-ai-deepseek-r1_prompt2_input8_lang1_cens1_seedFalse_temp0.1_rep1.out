Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "Numeroidut näytteet 1 ja 2" and "Näyte 3". The third sample is from the prostate, but what's the procedure? The text says "Prostata biopsiasta" in the example, but here, looking at the sample types: the first two samples are numbered, and the third is part of the prostate tissue. Wait, the example used "biopsy" when the sample was a biopsy. Here, the third sample is part of the prostate being examined, but the procedure isn't explicitly stated. The text mentions "radikaaliprostatetomian" in the example, but here, maybe it's a biopsy? Wait, the third sample is "suurimman osan nyt tutkittavasta prostatasolukosta", which might be from a resection. But the example had "biopsy" when the sample was a biopsy. However, in the given input, the samples are numbered, which is typical for biopsies. Also, the first two samples are "ei-primääristä solukkoa", but sample 3 is the main one. The text doesn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP. So maybe the sample type is biopsy. But the user instructions say if it's not clear, use NA. Wait, the example used "biopsy" when the sample was a biopsy. Here, the samples are numbered (like biopsy cores), so likely Sampletype is "biopsy".

Second, malignancy. The text says "Numeroilla 1 ja 2 ajetut näytteet todettiin olevan maligniteeteista vapaita." So samples 1 and 2 are benign. What about sample 3? The third sample has "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia", but mentions "immunologinen aktiviteetti on erittäin ilmeistä ja normaaleja tulehdukseen liittyviä muutoksia epäillään." Also, "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan" and "matalempi grade kattoi n. 10% näytteestä, mutta itse graden arvo puuttuu". So there's suspicion but no clear malignancy. The first two are benign, sample 3 has some features but no confirmed malignancy. The user instructions say to report the worst lesion. Since samples 1 and 2 are benign, and sample 3's malignancy is uncertain (no clear Gleason, possible inflammation), the overall malignancy is "ei" because the worst is benign. Wait, but the example had "kyllä" when cancer was found. Here, sample 3's findings are unclear. The text says "maligniteeteista vapaita" for 1 and 2, but sample 3's status is ambiguous. The user instruction says to consider only the worst lesion. If sample 3's findings are not confirmed as malignant, then malignancy is "ei". But the text mentions "mahdollisesti kiinnostavia" but no clear malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Third, Gleason. The text says "Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin; ... itse graden arvo puuttuu". So no Gleason score is provided. The example had "NA" if benign. Since malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is biopsy, malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA".
