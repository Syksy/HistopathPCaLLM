Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given histopathological statement related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "prostate tissue" but doesn't specify the sample type. Terms like biopsy, RP, or TURP aren't present. The text talks about processing the sample material in batches and technical difficulties, but there's no indication of the sample's origin. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The statement says the epithelial cell lining appears normal and mentions disproportionate glandular structures possibly due to processing issues. It also states that conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. There's no mention of malignancy, cancer, adenocarcinoma, or tumor. So Malignancy would be NA since there's no clear evidence either way, and the report is inconclusive.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The format should be major+minor=sum if malignant, otherwise NA. Since there's no indication of malignancy, and the report doesn't mention Gleason scores, this field should be NA as well.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have all fields as NA because the statement doesn't provide the necessary information for any of the three categories.
