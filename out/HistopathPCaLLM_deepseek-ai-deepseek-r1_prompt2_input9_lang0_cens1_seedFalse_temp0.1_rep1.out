Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a given medical text related to prostate cancer. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the original sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided statement, it mentions "sample material was obtained" and "prostate tissue was observed." However, there's no specific mention of the procedure type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. The text talks about processing the sample in batches and technical difficulties, but doesn't specify the sample type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, checking for malignant tumor findings. The allowed values are yes, no, or NA. The text states that the epithelial cell lining appears normal and glandular structures are disproportionate, possibly due to processing issues. It also mentions conclusions can't be conclusively drawn and suspects faulty processing. There's no mention of cancer or malignancy detected. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, but the sample processing was problematic, it's safer to mark Malignancy as NA instead of assuming no. Because the report doesn't confirm the presence or absence due to processing issues.

Lastly, the Gleason grade. The example shows it should be in the format "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since there's no mention of malignancy, and the Gleason grade isn't reported here, this field should be NA.

So putting it all together, all three fields would be NA. The key points are the lack of specific sample type, no clear malignancy finding, and no Gleason mentioned. The processing issues mean the results are inconclusive, so we can't assume anything beyond what's explicitly stated.
