Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. The given text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I recall that "elektrosektio" refers to TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "No malignancy is present". So Malignancy is "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy, the Gleason should be "NA". The report doesn't mention any Gleason grades, which aligns with the benign finding.

I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion is considered. Here, since it's benign, there's no Gleason to report. The JSON should reflect these values accurately.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
