Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract structured data from a Finnish histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the input text: "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". The term "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to "electroresection chips" or "TURP specimens". So the sample type here should be TURP.

Next, check for malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which means "No malignancy is present". So the malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason score isn't applicable. The instructions say to use "NA" for benign findings. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is TURP, Malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. I need to make sure the JSON structure doesn't have nested elements and only includes the worst lesion's results. The example provided uses "Gleason": "NA" when there's no malignancy, so that's correct here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
