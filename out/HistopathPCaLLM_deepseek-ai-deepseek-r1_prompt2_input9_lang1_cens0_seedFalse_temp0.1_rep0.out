Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The input text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I'm not entirely sure what "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to. But I know TURP stands for transurethral resection of the prostate, which is a procedure where they remove part of the prostate. "Elektrosektio" might be related to TURP. So maybe Sampletype here is TURP. Let me confirm. Yes, TURP is often referred to as elektrosektio in Finnish contexts. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text says "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin, joten löydös sopii hyvänlaatuiseen liikakasvuun." That translates to no malignancy found, so the finding is benign. So Malignancy should be "ei".

Gleason score. The report states there's no malignancy, so according to the instructions, Gleason should be NA. There's no mention of any Gleason grading here because it's benign. So Gleason is "NA".

Let me double-check each part. The sample type is definitely TURP. Malignancy is correctly "ei" since no malignancy was found. Gleason is NA because it's benign. All the required fields are covered, and there's no nested structures. The JSON should be straightforward.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
