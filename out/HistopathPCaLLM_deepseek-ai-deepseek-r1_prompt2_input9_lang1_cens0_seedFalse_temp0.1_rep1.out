Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract specific structured data into JSON. The three fields needed are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. Let's go through each step.

First, the sample type. The original text mentions "prostatan elektrosektiolastuja". I need to map this to one of the allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Elektrosektio might refer to TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure often abbreviated as TURP. So Sampletype should be "TURP".

Next, malignancy. The text states "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin", which translates to "No malignancy is present". So Malignancy should be "ei".

For Gleason score, since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason field should be "NA" as per the instructions. The example shows that if malignancy is "ei", Gleason is NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason in a non-malignant case, we still put NA. But here, there's no mention of Gleason at all, so definitely NA.

I need to make sure there's no nested structures in the JSON. The keys are straightforward. Let me double-check each part. The sample type is TURP, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is NA. That fits the criteria. No errors here.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
