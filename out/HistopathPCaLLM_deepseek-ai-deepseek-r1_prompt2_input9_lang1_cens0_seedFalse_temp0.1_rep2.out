Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to extract structured data from a free-text histopathology report of the prostate. The three fields to focus on are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the input text: "Tutkittavaksi on saatu prostatan elektrosektiolastuja..." The term "elektrosektiolastuja" translates to "electroresection chips" or "TURP specimens". TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type here should be "TURP".

Next, checking for malignancy. The text states, "Mitään malignia ei tule esiin, joten löydös sopii hyvänlaatuiseen liikakasvuun." This means no malignancy was found. So the Malignancy field should be "ei" (no).

For Gleason grade, the report mentions there's no malignancy. According to the instructions, if the findings are benign, Gleason should be "NA". There's no mention of Gleason scores here, so that's straightforward.

Now, I need to make sure there are no nested structures and only the worst lesion's results are reported. Since the text clearly states no malignancy, all criteria are met. The sample type is correctly identified as TURP, malignancy is "ei", and Gleason is "NA".

Double-checking the example provided: when malignancy is "ei", Gleason is "NA". That aligns with this case. Also, the sample type from "elektrosektiolastuja" maps to TURP. Everything seems to fit the required structure without any issues.
