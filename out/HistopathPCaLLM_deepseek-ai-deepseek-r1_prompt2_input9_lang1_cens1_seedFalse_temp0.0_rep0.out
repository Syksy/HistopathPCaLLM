Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. The three fields are Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the given text: "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin, josta noin puolet käsiteltiin. Toinen puoli heitettiin pois käyttämättömänä. Ajot tehtiin 8:ssa stepissä, minkä jälkeen materiaali tutkittiin histologisesti." The text mentions "näytemateriaalia" which translates to sample material, but it doesn't specify the type like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). There's no mention of any of the specific procedures, so the sample type should be "NA".

Next, checking for malignancy. The allowed values are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report states: "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa havaittiin, ja epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta. Osat rauhasrakenteista vaikuttaa suhteettoman kokoisilta, mikä voi johtua teknisistä haasteista näytteen käsittelyssä. Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti nykyisestä materiaalista, ja virheellistä näytteenkäsittelyä epäillään." There's no mention of cancer (adenokarsinooma) or any malignant findings. Instead, they mention that conclusions can't be drawn confidently and suspect sample handling issues. So, malignancy isn't confirmed, so the answer here is "ei" (no) or "NA"? Wait, the options are "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". Since the report doesn't confirm any malignancy, but does it explicitly say there are no malignant findings? The text says they found a lot of prostate tissue, epithelial borders seem normal, some structures are disproportionately sized possibly due to technical issues. No mention of cancer. So maybe "ei" (no malignancy found) or "NA" if it's uncertain. But according to the example, if the report is unclear, malignancy is "NA". In the example given, the nonsensical report had all "NA". Here, since they can't draw conclusions, maybe malignancy is "NA" because it's uncertain. But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. If there's no mention of malignancy, then "ei". But the report says they can't draw conclusions, so maybe "NA" is safer. Hmm. Let me check the example again. The example where the report was unclear had malignancy as "NA". So in this case, since the conclusion can't be made, malignancy should be "NA".

Third, Gleason score. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since there's no mention of cancer, the Gleason would be "NA".

So putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA, Gleason is NA. But wait, the sample type: the text doesn't mention biopsy, RP, or TURP. So NA is correct. Malignancy: since they can't conclude, and no mention of cancer, NA. Gleason: no cancer found, so NA.
