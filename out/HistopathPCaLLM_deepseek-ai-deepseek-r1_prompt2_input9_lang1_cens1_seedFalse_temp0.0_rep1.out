Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathological report on prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The options are biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or NA. Looking at the provided text, the sample mentions "näytemateriaalia saatiin" and talks about processing in steps, but there's no clear mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP. The example where it's unclear uses NA, so maybe here it's also NA.

Next, malignancy. The report says "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa havaittiin, ja epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta." There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy indicators. It also states that conclusions can't be drawn due to possible sample handling errors. So malignancy is likely "ei" or "NA". But since there's no clear malignancy, maybe "ei" if benign, but the example uses NA when uncertain. However, the example with unclear malignancy used NA. Here, since they can't draw conclusions, maybe malignancy is NA.

Gleason score. The text doesn't mention Gleason grades or any numbers like 3+4=7. So Gleason should be NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the type isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the report is inconclusive. Gleason is NA because there's no mention of it.
