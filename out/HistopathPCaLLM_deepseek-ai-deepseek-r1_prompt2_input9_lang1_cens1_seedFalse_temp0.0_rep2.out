Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text, the key phrases are "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin" and mentions of processing in steps. The term "biopsia" (biopsy) isn't explicitly mentioned here. The text talks about handling the sample in steps, but there's no clear indication of RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Since it's unclear, the sample type should be NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa havaittiin, ja epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta." The epithelial border appears normal, and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. However, there's a mention of possible technical issues affecting the sample processing. The conclusion states that no definitive conclusions can be drawn, and faulty processing is suspected. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but the sample might be inadequate, the malignancy field should be NA, not "ei" because the report doesn't confirm benign findings either.

For Gleason score, the report doesn't mention any Gleason grades like 3, 4, or 5. Since malignancy isn't confirmed, Gleason should be NA.

So, all three fields would be NA because the sample type isn't specified, malignancy isn't confirmed, and Gleason isn't reported.
