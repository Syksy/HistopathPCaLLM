Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON format. Let me go through each of the required fields step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Looking at the provided text: "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin..." which translates to getting some sample material. The text mentions "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue) but doesn't specify the sample type. Terms like "biopsia" (biopsy) or "TURP" aren't present. The procedure involved cutting into 8 steps, but that's part of processing, not the sample type. Since there's no clear indication, the sample type should be "NA".

Next, malignancy. The options are "kyllä" (yes), "ei" (no), or "NA". The report states "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (epithelial tissue border appears normal) and "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti..." (conclusions can't be drawn reliably). There's no mention of cancer or malignancy. So, malignancy is "ei" or "NA"? Wait, the instructions say if there are malignant findings, but here there's no mention. Since the sample processing was problematic and they can't draw conclusions, maybe it's safer to put "NA" because the presence of malignancy isn't confirmed. But the question is whether there were malignant findings in the sample. If the sample is inconclusive due to handling issues, maybe the answer is "ei" (no) because no malignancy was detected, but the report is uncertain. Hmm. The example given in the problem had an inconclusive report leading to "NA" for all. In the example, the text was nonsensical, but here the report is valid but inconclusive. The key is whether malignancy was found. Since they can't conclude, but the sample didn't show malignancy (epithelial borders normal, no mention of cancer cells), maybe "ei". But the user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. If there's no mention of any malignancy, then "ei". But if the sample is inadequate, maybe "NA". The example where the report was unclear used "NA". In this case, the report says they can't draw conclusions due to suspected faulty processing. So maybe malignancy is "NA" because the sample is inadequate.

Third, Gleason score. If malignancy is "ei" or "NA", then Gleason is "NA". Since there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason in the text, even if malignancy were "kyllä", but here it's not. So Gleason is definitely "NA".

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA, Malignancy is NA (because the sample is inadequate and no reliable conclusion), Gleason is NA.
