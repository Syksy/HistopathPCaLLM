Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to process a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract structured data into JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, and Gleason. 

First, I need to determine the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Looking at the input text: "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin..." which translates to getting some grams of sample material. There's mention of processing and steps done, but no clear terms like biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text mentions "prostatasolukkoa" (prostate tissue), but not the procedure type. So Sampletype is NA.

Next, checking for malignancy. The text says "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (epithelial tissue border appears normal) and "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti..." (conclusions can't be drawn reliably). There's no mention of cancer (adenokarsinooma) or malignancy. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no) or maybe NA? Wait, the options are kyllä, ei, NA. Since the sample processing was problematic and they can't draw conclusions, maybe malignancy is NA. But the question is whether there were malignant findings. If no malignancy is found and the sample is inconclusive due to handling issues, maybe it's safer to put "ei" if no malignancy is mentioned. But the example given in the problem where the sample is unclear also uses NA. In the example, the report was nonsensical, so they used NA. Here, the report says they can't draw conclusions due to suspected faulty processing, so maybe malignancy is NA. Hmm. The user instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" (worst lesion results) should be reported. But if the sample is inadequate, maybe malignancy is NA. Let me check the example again. The example where the report was unclear had all NAs. In this case, the report mentions no malignancy, but the sample is problematic. So perhaps Malignancy is NA because the results are inconclusive. But the user instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If there's no mention of malignancy, even if inconclusive, maybe it's "ei". But the example used NA when the report was unclear. Here, the conclusion is that they can't draw conclusions due to suspected faulty processing, so maybe malignancy is NA. I think the correct answer here is Malignancy: NA.

For Gleason, since there's no mention of cancer, and malignancy is NA or "ei", Gleason should be NA. The text doesn't mention Gleason scores at all. So Gleason is NA.

Putting it all together: Sampletype is NA because the procedure isn't specified. Malignancy is NA because the results are inconclusive due to processing issues. Gleason is NA because no cancer is found or reported.
