Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to parse a Finnish histopathology report for prostate cancer and extract three specific pieces of information into a structured JSON. Let's go step by step.

First, the sample type. The allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The example given was "biopsy" when the text mentioned "Prostata biopsiasta". Looking at the current input, the text says "Muutaman tusinan gramman verran näytemateriaalia saatiin..." which translates to getting some sample material. There's no mention of biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The text talks about processing the sample in steps and issues with handling, but doesn't specify the sample type. So Sampletype should be NA.

Next, malignancy. The options are kyllä (yes), ei (no), or NA. The report mentions "Suuria määriä prostatasolukkoa" (large amounts of prostate tissue) and "epiteelisolukon raja vaikuttaa normaalilta" (epithelial border seems normal). There's no mention of adenocarcinoma or malignancy indicators. However, there's a note that conclusions can't be drawn due to possible sample handling errors. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but the sample might be inadequate, should malignancy be 'ei' or 'NA'? The example had 'kyllä' when cancer was found. Here, since no malignancy is detected but the sample is problematic, maybe 'ei' (no) because they didn't find any, but the uncertainty might lead to NA. Wait, the instructions say "pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä" (malignant findings). If the sample is inconclusive due to handling, but no malignancy is found, then maybe 'ei'. But the user might consider that if the sample is inadequate, it's NA. Hmm. The example where the sample was inadequate had malignancy as NA. Wait, in the second example given by the user, the text was nonsensical and they used NA for all. But in this case, the sample is processed but results are inconclusive. However, the report doesn't state any malignancy, just normal borders. So perhaps malignancy is 'ei' (no). But the user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" (only the worst lesion's results should be returned). If there's no mention of malignancy, then 'ei'. But if the sample is inadequate, maybe NA. The text says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti nykyisestä materiaalista, ja virheellistä näytteenkäsittelyä epäillään." So conclusions can't be drawn. Does that mean malignancy is NA because it's uncertain? But the sample didn't show malignancy. The example where malignancy was present had clear terms like adenokarsinooma. Here, since there's no mention of cancer, maybe 'ei'. But the uncertainty in the report might make it NA. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the instructions again. The second example had a nonsensical report, so all NA. Here, the report is coherent but inconclusive. Since no malignancy is found, even if the sample is problematic, maybe 'ei'. But if the sample is inadequate, maybe the presence of malignancy can't be assessed, hence NA. The key is whether the sample is sufficient to determine malignancy. The text says "Johtopäätöksiä ei voida vetää varmasti" (conclusions can't be drawn with certainty), which suggests that they can't confirm, but maybe they didn't find any malignancy. So perhaps malignancy is 'ei' because no malignancy was detected, even though the sample is problematic. Alternatively, if the sample is inadequate, maybe it's NA. The user's instructions say "pahimman leesion tulokset" — if there's no lesion found, then 'ei'. So I'll go with 'ei'.

Third, Gleason score. The format is "major+minor=sum" if malignant, else NA. Since malignancy is 'ei' (no), then Gleason should be NA. Even if there was a mention of Gleason in the text, but here there's none. The text doesn't mention Gleason at all, so definitely NA.

So the final JSON would be:

Sampletype: NA (since no biopsy, RP, or TURP mentioned)
Malignancy: ei (no malignancy found, despite inconclusive sample)
Gleason: NA (no malignancy, so no Gleason)

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
