```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
``` 

**Explanation:**  
1. **Sampletype**: The text mentions "studied material originates from the prostate" but does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP), so "NA" is used.  
2. **Malignancy**: While clinical notes mention "possible 'Gleason sum 7'", the text explicitly states the material is "very difficult to assess" due to radiation therapy, and no definitive malignant findings are confirmed. Thus, "NA" is appropriate.  
3. **Gleason**: The reference to "Gleason sum 7" is uncertain ("unclear if this is GG 2 or 3" and not verified), and the histopathology is deemed unreliable for assessment. Therefore, "NA" is assigned.  

The response adheres to the instruction to prioritize the most severe *verifiable* lesion (here, none can be verified).
