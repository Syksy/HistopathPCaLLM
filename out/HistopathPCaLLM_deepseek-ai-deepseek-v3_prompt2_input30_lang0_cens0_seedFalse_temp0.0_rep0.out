Here is the structured JSON output for the provided histopathological statement:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells," but it does not clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, or TURP). Thus, "NA" is assigned.
2. **Malignancy**: The text confirms "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," so "yes" is assigned.
3. **Gleason**: The most severe lesion is described with "grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3," resulting in "4+3=7." The tertiary pattern (grade 5) is not included in the primary Gleason score, as only the major and minor patterns are considered for the sum. The prior "3+3" is not used because the updated diagnosis is more severe.
