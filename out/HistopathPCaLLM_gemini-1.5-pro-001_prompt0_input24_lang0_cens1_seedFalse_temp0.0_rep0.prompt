Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples consisted of multiple sets of patients, from whom biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings had been available post-benign diagnosis. The examined material was intended to illustrate inter-observed variation and to train the interns in low grade scoring settings; in around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4 thanks to advancements in imaging. The re-evaluation of the cases showed no upgrading to GG 3 or above. SUMMARY: Teaching material of multiple patients were inspected by interns and then verified by senior histopathologists, resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6. Due to the long time since the sample material was gathered (>15y), the exercise was not intended for actual clinical guidance.
