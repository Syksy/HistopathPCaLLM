Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol, with the weight(s) fitting within the scope of normal reference values. Microscopically prostate tissue is observed, which appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages. Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed, as approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated. The requested evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. All parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section were inspected, and the cell architecture was confirmed to resemble prostate tissue.
