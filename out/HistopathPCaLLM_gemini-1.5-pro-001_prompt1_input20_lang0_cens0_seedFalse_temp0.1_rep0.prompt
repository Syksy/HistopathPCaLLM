Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection, which has been divided into six macrosections and the usual microscopic sections. Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma. Longitudinal section from the apex shows microscopically both fusing of the grandular structures, fitting best into the Gleason 3+4 staging, while the basis presents mostly with class 4+4. The size of these malignant focuses are approx. 8mm and 5mm, respectively. However, no breaching of the prostate capsule is observed, and the surgical margins are clear.
