```json
{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
 
Although the text mentions Gleason 4 and adenocarcinoma with a sum of 8, it doesn't provide the primary Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason score is represented as "NA" due to the lack of a complete "major+minor=sum" format.
