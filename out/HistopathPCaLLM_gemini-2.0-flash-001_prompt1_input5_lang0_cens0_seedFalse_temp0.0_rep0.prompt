Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy, with the weight of prostate 50g. Left section is run in yellow and right section in green. Apex is longitudinally inserted into macroblocks A & B. Cross sections from the basis as C-E and longitudinal from left to right as F-H. Left seminal vehicle into block I and right into block J. Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, with the dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. In macro B higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5, with the proportions approx 50% and 20%. Other prostate macroblocks are clean along with the seminal vehicles. No penetration of the prostate capsule or perineural invasion is observed.
