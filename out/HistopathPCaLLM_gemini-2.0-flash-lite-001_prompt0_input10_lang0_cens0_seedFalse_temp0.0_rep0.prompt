Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Samples include 8 representative prostate systematic biopsies from typical locations, with total length approx 120mm. The slides show prostate tissue with some basal cell hyperplasia. In immonological stainings of samples 3-4, basal cells are highlighted and stainings positive, but the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion: Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign.
