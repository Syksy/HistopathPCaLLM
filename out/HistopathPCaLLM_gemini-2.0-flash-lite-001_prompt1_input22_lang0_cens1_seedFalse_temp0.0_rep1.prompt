Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


A container of prostate tissue sampling material was inspected, with fragmentation to lengths 10 and 7mm in sample material originating from the left side and 15 and 10mm from the right side. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentation types. Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult, and proof-checking ought to be conducted that the material truly originates from prostate and the conservation of samples has not been contaminated by e.g. bacterial agent. As it is, the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed.
