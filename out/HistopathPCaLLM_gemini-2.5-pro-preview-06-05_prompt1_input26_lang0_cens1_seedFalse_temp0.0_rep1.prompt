Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The studied material originates from the prostate, and is processed according to the usual processing procedures and markings. Samples are marked with indices A-C for material attributed to apex and indices D-F for sources closer to basis. Histological inspection reveals that the material from apex and basis is very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy. Clinical notes mention possible 'Gleason sum 7'; however, it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified. Due to the recent RT the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory, and instead assessing spread through the capsule, nearby lymph nodes, or distant mets should be prioritized.
