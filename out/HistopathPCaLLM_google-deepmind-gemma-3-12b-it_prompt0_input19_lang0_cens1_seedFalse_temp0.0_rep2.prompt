Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type. Samples were divided into 4 batches and include borderline low to sufficient amounts of material for histopathological inspection. Sample 1 is unrepresentative of the prostate, while samples 2 and 3 represent healthy benign prostate tissue. In sample 4, the whole sample's length contain cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue. However, quality control suggests that it is uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant). To rule out possibility of a lab mishap, sample 4's lab trajectory will be first verified before proceeding further into the histopathology.
