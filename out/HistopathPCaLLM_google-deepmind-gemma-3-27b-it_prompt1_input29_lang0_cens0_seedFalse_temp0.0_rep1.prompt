Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g. Samples were taken as follows: closest to apex A - left lobe, B - right lobe, and from the next plane C - left lobe, D - right lobe, and highermost plane E - left lobe, F- right lobe. From the left lobe casettes A and C invasive adenocarcinoma is observed, which has penetrated the capsule and perineural invasion is also present. Tumor cells form both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4. Tumor diameter is larger than 2 cm. SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections.
