Based on the provided text, it's difficult to definitively determine the Gleason grade or even confirm malignancy from the prostate tissue itself. The text focuses on macroscopic findings, lymph node status, and seminal vesicle status, rather than microscopic analysis of the prostate tissue sections for cancer grading. There is no mention of Gleason scores or adenocarcinoma. The statement mentions examination results are different from one sample to another, but does not specify the nature of findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate response based *solely* on the provided text is:

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
