Based on the provided text, it's difficult to definitively determine the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade for a specific lesion as the text describes multiple samples with varying results and focuses on the overall findings (clear lymph nodes and seminal vesicles). However, the text mentions "original primary prostate tissue," which could imply a radical prostatectomy (RP) or potentially a biopsy if it's referring to initial diagnostic samples. Since the text states "findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain" and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined, this context is more suggestive of an RP. But the final sentence states that the examined lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, which doesn't directly provide the Gleason grade or confirm malignancy *within the prostate tissue itself* based on this specific snippet. The statement does not provide information about the Gleason score or malignancy directly related to the prostate tissue samples described.

Therefore, based strictly on the provided text snippet:

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
