Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The prepared samples are processed through the standard routine procedures, so that right side of the prostate is indicated differently than the left side. Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O. Multiple clear well prepared prostate tissue sites can be observed, likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy. This assessment, together with complementing histopathology with full body imaging and status of seminal vehicles, lymph nodes, and capsule intactness will be held out as an assignment to specializing resident candidates in next week's course session. The status update from the consensus will then be appended to this preliminary report.
