Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Samples 1 and 2 contain lymph nodes (3 pcs each), with lengths spanning 1 to 3 cm. Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate, which is run according to the routine protocol. In the third sample tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties and forming fusing and separately growing grandular structures. The findings cover approx 10% of the section area. Additionally, aggregates of macrophages are observed and high grade inflammatory changes. Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with the lower grade 3 consisting of approx 30%. High grade PIN-changes are also observed. The inspected lymph nodes are free from malignant findings (0/6).
