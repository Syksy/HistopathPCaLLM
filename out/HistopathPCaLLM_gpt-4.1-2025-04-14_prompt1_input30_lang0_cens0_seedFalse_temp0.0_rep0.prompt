Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Cells had shown a lot of atrophy and possibly some atypical patterns, but the notable amount of burn artefacts on the histological slides made interpretation difficult. Basal cell structures were also observed. JD & JD both confirmed that the samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells do show a diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5. The relatively uncertain diagnosis (3+3) from the patient from before should be updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1). The patient should be contacted to discuss further options.
