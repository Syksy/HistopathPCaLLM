Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate, which is run on casettes according to normal routines. Samples D-G have apex, basis in samples K-P, seminal vehicles O-Q. Already in first section some tumorous growth is observed peripherally, with the tumor growth reaching near the capsule border. No breach is seen nor is there any pos. surgical margins. Basis and seminal vehicles are clean. The found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings.
