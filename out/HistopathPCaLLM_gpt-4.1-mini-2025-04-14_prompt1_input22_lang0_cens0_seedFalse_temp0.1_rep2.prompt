Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


A container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both side is inspected, with the left side fragments 10 and 7mm in length and right side 15 and 10mm. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4. Furthermore, neural bundles appear surrounded by cancerous growth. The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies.
