Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches due to a logistics error, which made suitable combining of the sample material difficult. However, on preliminary examination, normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material. In the institute's experimental panel of immunological stainings of the latest two samples, clear patterns emerged, verifying that the panel worked. Suspicious formations that hinted at stainings failing were observed in some of the earlier samples, so conclusive verification of the panel's reliability could not be established. Conclusion: Suspicion of the staining immunopanel of prostate tissue failing in some of the samples, although most of the material appeared to exhibit expected patterns.
