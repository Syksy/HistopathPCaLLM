Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The sample consists of comfirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings, of which about half are run via 6 tissue casettes. In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth. Some degree of chronically inflammated tissue is also present. SUMMARY: Formerly benignly classified sample with a malignant suspicion had its chippings re-evaluated, now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma.
