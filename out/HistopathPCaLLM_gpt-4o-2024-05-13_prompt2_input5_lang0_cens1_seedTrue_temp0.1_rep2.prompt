Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." is a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
} 
 In contrast, the statement "fatty 100 that tumour led no 37 previous atypical 153 pt3a cores maximum malignancy. 8mm aggressive 60 11mm group value 257 invasion from lot 38mm latest both it moderate gleason. Deposit before total focus included 12mm however, 10 gland distance 20 length active tumor prior underwent 80 clear 18, but relatively adipose 95 undergone 95 second 18mm dominant could contour residual glands 4+3 gg. All fat 67 included score grading revision multifocal minimal core obturator remain 9mm tertiary both 95 seen original radical. maximum tissue seminal 28mm confirmed 08000 node mid positivity 8mm are failure phenotype apex routine do small urothelial internal these" is not a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate. Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + cross sections). Based on reading the report by produced by a colleague, the samples are indexed as A to H. Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings. Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred. Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection. Based on the patient's clinical report from the referral center, it would be likely that prostate capsule is intact and likely no perineural invasion has occurred either.
