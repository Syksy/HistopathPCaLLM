Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited.
