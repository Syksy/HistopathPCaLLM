Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Sample (1) contains multi-faceted tissue sample shapes, with measurable dimensions 0, 0.5, 1mm. In the only measurable plane, approximately all of it could be assessed in respect to its Gleason differentiation patterns, but due to differing views this case will be discussed at next uro-meeting. Sample (2) consistent of fragmented tissue material where differentiation could not be assessed. Sample (3) contained two locations of non-representative tissue material. Samples (1) and (2) were initially thought to contain PIN-changes, but these were later retracted as an unreliable conclusion. Thus, conclusion based on above samples (1-3) is that presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified.
