Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." is a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
} 
 In contrast, the statement "fatty 100 that tumour led no 37 previous atypical 153 pt3a cores maximum malignancy. 8mm aggressive 60 11mm group value 257 invasion from lot 38mm latest both it moderate gleason.

 {
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The presented case has gone through a multitude of complementary diseases in the pelvic region with accompanying interventions, which have affected cell morphology also in the prostatic region. The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region; shifting the samples longitudinally or latitudinally reveals that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. Even in the hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found, the patient's overall disease burden is heavily influenced to lean toward prioritizing the other on-going treatments. In the scenario that the patient's overall situation allows it, assessment of whether the prostate capsule is fully intact would be a priority, after cell differentation staging. Prostatic region ought to be independently investigated and re-sampled, once the recovery period allows it.
