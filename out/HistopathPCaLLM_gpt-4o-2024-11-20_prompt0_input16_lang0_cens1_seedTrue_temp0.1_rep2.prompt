Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate. Among the total sample material, about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns that were closely inspected in digital histopathology. In these, various grades of cell differentation are observed, although assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. Conclusion is that grading of the sample content ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, and then re-entered into the statement system. This scrutiny is warranted, as any mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentation would be very difficult to reliable assess due to some mishap in digitalization.
