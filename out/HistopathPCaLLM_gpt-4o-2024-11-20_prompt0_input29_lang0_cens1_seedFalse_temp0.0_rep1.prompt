Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request. Samples were taken as follows: A - left lower, B - right lower, and then C - left middle, D - right middle, and then E - left higher, F - right higher. From sample indices A and C non-prostatic tissue is observed, which suggests that the sampling procedure had something that was contaminated. Capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed, as these samples A and C were of particular interest. Colleague had requested particularly the assessment of potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure observations arising from the said samples, which remains to be re-examined in further sampling. SUMMARY: Score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined.
