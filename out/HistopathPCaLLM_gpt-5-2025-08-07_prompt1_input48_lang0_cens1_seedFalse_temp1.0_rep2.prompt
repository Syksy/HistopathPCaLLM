Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Investigating in URO-101 course prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies with total size approx 100(?). Samples prepared according to standard routine, with apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles placed separately on cassettes. Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe. Seminal vesicles are all clean. Unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals, but interesting patterns are shown for educational purposes. SUMMARY: Some interesting findings, but due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5).
