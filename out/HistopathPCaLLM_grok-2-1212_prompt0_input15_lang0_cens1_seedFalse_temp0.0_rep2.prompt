Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Based on complementing clinical notes of the patient, the tissue material was processed with a high priority. Preliminary scopic inspection through the sample material confirms that the symptoms reported in the clinical notes may have a basis on histopathology, although representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time (clinical notes mentioned suspected presence of an adenocaricoma following disease trajectory akin to e.g. Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology). Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session, in order to be able to either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion.
