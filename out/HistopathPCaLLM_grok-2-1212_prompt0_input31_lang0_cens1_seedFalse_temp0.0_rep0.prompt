Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Patient undergone routine check due to suspicious symptoms. Symptoms had increased, so after imaging necessary samples were taken. A clear technical failure in the first sample. Other samples contain suspicious findings, but they encompass only 5 % ot the original samples. Patient has other treatments regarding unrelated diagnosis, it is unclear if these could have had effect on the suspicious findings. Interpretation of tissue proved difficult, additional samples and treatment planning needed.
