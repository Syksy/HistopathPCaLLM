Based on the provided text and the requirements for structuring the data, here is the JSON output for the most severe lesion described in the statement:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_Gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Original Sample Type**: The text does not specify the type of the original sample clearly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It mentions "original primary prostate tissue" but does not categorize it into the allowed values. Therefore, it is marked as "NA".
2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The text states that "the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear", indicating no malignant findings. Hence, it is marked as "no".
3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant findings reported, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
