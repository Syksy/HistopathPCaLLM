Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample clearly as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". It only mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material". Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "normal basal cells" and does not indicate any presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no mention of any malignant findings or Gleason grades, the value is set to "NA".
