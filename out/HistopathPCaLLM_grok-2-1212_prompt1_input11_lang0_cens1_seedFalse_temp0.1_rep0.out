Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive," which is not a confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but states that they "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
