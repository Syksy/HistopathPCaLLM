Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the "biopsy" sample type.
- **Malignancy**: The presence of carcinoma in the sample indicates malignant tumor findings, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies the Gleason score as 9, with the composition being 4+5. This represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the text, and thus it is reported as "4+5=9."
