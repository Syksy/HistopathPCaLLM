Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The presence of carcinoma indicates malignant tumor findings, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies the Gleason score as 9, with components 4 and 5, which is reported as "4+5=9." This represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the text.
