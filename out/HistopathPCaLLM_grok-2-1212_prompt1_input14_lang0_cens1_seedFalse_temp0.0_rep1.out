Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to a "comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue" and mentions samples being run in batches, but does not specify the source of these samples. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further investigation, but does not explicitly state the presence of malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

3. **Gleason**: The statement does not report a specific Gleason grade for the patient in question. It only mentions a comparison to another patient with a Gleason 7 score, but does not assign a Gleason grade to the current patient. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
