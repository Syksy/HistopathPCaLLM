Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly. It mentions "prostate tissue" and "cassettes" but does not indicate whether it is from a biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), or another type. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further investigation, but does not explicitly state the presence of malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not report a specific Gleason grade for the current sample. It mentions a comparison to another patient with a Gleason 7 score, but this is not a direct report of the Gleason grade for the current patient's sample. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
