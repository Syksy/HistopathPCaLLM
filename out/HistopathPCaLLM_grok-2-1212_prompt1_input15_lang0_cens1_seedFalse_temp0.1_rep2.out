Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion mentioned would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample clearly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It only mentions "prostate tissue material", hence it is categorized as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings based on histopathology. Therefore, it is categorized as "NA".
- **Gleason**: The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above but clarifies that this was not based on histopathology. Since no definitive Gleason grade was determined from the histopathological examination, it is categorized as "NA".
