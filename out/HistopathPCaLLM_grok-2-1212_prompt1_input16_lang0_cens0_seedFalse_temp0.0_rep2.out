Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies," indicating that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of carcinoma is explicitly mentioned, indicating malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grade as mainly level 3 with some Gleason 4 structures. The conclusion specifies a score of 7, derived from a combination where architecture 3 covers approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covers approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma part. Therefore, the most appropriate Gleason score representation, following the "major+minor=sum" format, would be "3+4=7".
