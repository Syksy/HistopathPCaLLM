Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" without specifying the method of collection. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. It mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" but does not conclude on malignancy. Hence, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates that assigning explicit Gleason scores was inconclusive due to issues with digital histopathology images. Therefore, no specific Gleason grade can be reported, and the value is set to "NA".
