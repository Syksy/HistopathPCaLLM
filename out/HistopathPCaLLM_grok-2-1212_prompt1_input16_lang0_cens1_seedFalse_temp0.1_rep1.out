Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" without specifying the method of collection. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. It mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" but does not conclude on the presence of malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates that assigning explicit Gleason scores was inconclusive due to issues with digital histopathology images. It suggests manual grading on slides before digitalization. Since no specific Gleason grade is reported, the value is set to "NA".
