Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "multiple clear foci" and specific mention of Gleason grades indicate malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." According to the Gleason scoring system, the most common grade (dominant) is listed first, followed by the second most common grade. Therefore, the Gleason score would be reported as "4+3=7".
