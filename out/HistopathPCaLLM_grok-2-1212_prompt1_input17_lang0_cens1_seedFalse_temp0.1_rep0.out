Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type explicitly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other type. It only mentions "prepared samples" without further detail, hence "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: There is no clear mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement. It discusses the possibility of assessing differentiation stages but does not confirm the presence of malignancy, hence "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades between 3 to 5 but does not report any specific Gleason grade, hence "NA".
