Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the original sample type as being a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). It only mentions "prepared samples" without specifying the type, hence "NA" (Not Available) is used.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions the possibility of assessing differentiation stages but does not provide a definitive diagnosis of malignancy, hence "NA" is used.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason grade for any detected malignancy. Therefore, "NA" is used as no specific Gleason grade is reported.
