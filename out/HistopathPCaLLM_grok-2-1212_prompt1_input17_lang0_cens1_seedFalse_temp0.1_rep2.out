Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type explicitly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other type. It only mentions "prepared samples" without further detail, hence "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions the possibility of assessing differentiation stages but does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hence "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing Gleason grades but does not provide a specific Gleason grade, hence "NA".
