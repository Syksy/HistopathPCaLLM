Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of procedure used to obtain the sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that over 95% of the material appears benign, and the suspicious focus is too small to properly assign a grade group. Therefore, without a confirmed malignant finding, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and mentions that the suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade group, the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
