Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in sample 4, which is a malignant finding, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason grades 3 and 4 in sample 4, with Gleason 3 comprising approximately 90% and Gleason 4 comprising 10%. According to the Gleason grading system, the grade with the higher value (even if it occupies a smaller area) is reported second. Therefore, the structured Gleason score should be "3+4=7."
