Based on the provided statement and the instructions, the structured JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason grades 3 and 4 in sample 4, with Gleason 3 comprising approximately 90% and Gleason 4 comprising 10%. Following the convention of reporting the Gleason score as "major+minor=sum," and considering that the higher grade (even if less prevalent) is typically reported as the minor component in the Gleason score, the correct format would be "3+4=7."
