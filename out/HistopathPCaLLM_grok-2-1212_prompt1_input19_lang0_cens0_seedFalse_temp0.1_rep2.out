Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in sample 4, which is a malignant finding, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The Gleason grades mentioned are 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). According to the Gleason scoring system, the grade with the highest percentage is listed first, followed by the next highest, and then their sum. Therefore, the Gleason score is "3+4=7."
