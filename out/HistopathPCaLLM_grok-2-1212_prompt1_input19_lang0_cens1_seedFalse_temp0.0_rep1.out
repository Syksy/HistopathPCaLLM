Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions that the samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type. Therefore, the value is "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates uncertainty about the nature of the tissue in sample 4, suggesting it might be malignant but this is not confirmed. Therefore, the value is "NA".
- **Gleason**: Since the malignancy is not confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the value is "NA".
