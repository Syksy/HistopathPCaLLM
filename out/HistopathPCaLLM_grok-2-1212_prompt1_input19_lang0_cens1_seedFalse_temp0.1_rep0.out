Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions that the samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type. Therefore, the sample type is not clearly identified and is marked as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates uncertainty about the nature of the tissue in sample 4, suggesting it might be malignant but this is not confirmed. Therefore, without a clear confirmation of malignancy, it is marked as "NA".
- **Gleason**: Since there is no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade mentioned in the statement, this field is also marked as "NA".
