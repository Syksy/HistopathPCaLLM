Based on the provided statement and the rules specified, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample clearly. It mentions "prostate cancer samples" but does not indicate whether these are from a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or another type. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the results are inconclusive and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy. Therefore, it is not possible to determine definitively if there were malignant tumor findings, leading to a value of "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions potential Gleason findings but states that additional inspection is required. Since no specific Gleason grades are provided and the findings are inconclusive, the value is set to "NA".
