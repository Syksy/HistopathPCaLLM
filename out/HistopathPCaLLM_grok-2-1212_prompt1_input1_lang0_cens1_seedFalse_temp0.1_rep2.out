Based on the provided statement and the specified criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions "prostate cancer samples from standard locations," which does not fit into the allowed values. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the results are inconclusive and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy. Therefore, it cannot be determined if there are malignant tumor findings, and the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings" but does not provide specific Gleason grades. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
