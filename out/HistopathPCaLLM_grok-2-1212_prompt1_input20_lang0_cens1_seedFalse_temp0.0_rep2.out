Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion mentioned in the text would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the original sample type as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It mentions "prostate tissue samples" but does not categorize them into the allowed values. Therefore, the value is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions the impossibility of examining possible adenocarcinoma due to the effects of therapies on the prostate tissue. Therefore, the value is "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario of finding a lower level Gleason such as 3+4, but it does not confirm the presence of any Gleason grade in the actual findings. Therefore, the value is "NA".
