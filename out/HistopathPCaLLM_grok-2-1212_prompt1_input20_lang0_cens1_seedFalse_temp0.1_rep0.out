Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It mentions "prostate tissue samples" but does not categorize them into the allowed values. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions the impossibility of examining possible adenocarcinoma due to the effects of therapies on the prostate tissue. Hence, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not report a confirmed Gleason grade. It mentions a hypothetical scenario of finding a lower level Gleason (3+4), but this is not a confirmed finding. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
