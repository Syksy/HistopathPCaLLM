Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings," which typically refers to tissue obtained from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is identified as "TURP."
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "poorly differentiated growth," "enlarged nuclei," "nucleolus clearly visible," and "tumor-like tissue" indicates malignant findings, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the most common Gleason grade as 5 and the second most common as 4. For the most severe lesion, the highest grades are used to form the Gleason score, resulting in "5+4=9."
