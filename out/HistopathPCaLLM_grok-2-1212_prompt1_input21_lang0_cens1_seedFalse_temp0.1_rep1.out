Based on the provided statement and the specified criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "extracted prostate material," which does not fit into the allowed values. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions issues with the quality of the material and the need for further quality control (QC), but does not state whether malignancy was found. Thus, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: Since no malignancy is confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement, the value is set to "NA".
