Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of carcinoma on the left side, indicating malignant tumor findings, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason scores of 3 and 4 for the left side carcinoma, with 3 mentioned first and 4 second, indicating the most severe lesion's Gleason grade as "3+4=7." This is the most severe lesion reported in the statement, as the right side does not exhibit signs of malignancies.
