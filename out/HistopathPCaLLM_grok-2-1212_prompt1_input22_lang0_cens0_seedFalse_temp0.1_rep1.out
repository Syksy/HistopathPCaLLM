Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of carcinoma on the left side, indicating malignant tumor findings.
- **Gleason**: The most severe lesion mentioned is on the left side, with Gleason scores of 3 and 4. According to the statement, the primary (firstly) Gleason score is 3 and the secondary (secondly) is 4, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7. This represents the most severe lesion as per the statement, as the right side does not exhibit signs of malignancies.
