Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It mentions "prostate tissue sampling material," but does not categorize it into the allowed values. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their fragmented and varying nature. Hence, the presence of malignant tumor findings cannot be determined, leading to a value of "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is "exceptionally difficult" due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for proof-checking. Therefore, no Gleason grade can be reported, resulting in a value of "NA".
