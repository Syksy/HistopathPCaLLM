Based on the provided statement, the most severe lesion is found in either Sample (1) or Sample (2) as they both contain tumor tissue with specified Gleason grades. To determine the most severe lesion, we compare the Gleason scores. Both samples have a Gleason pattern of 4 and 3, but the proportions differ slightly. However, the overall Gleason score for both samples would be calculated as 4+3=7, which is the same. Therefore, we can consider either sample as the most severe lesion for the purpose of structuring the data.

Here is the structured JSON output based on the information from Sample (1) or Sample (2):

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
