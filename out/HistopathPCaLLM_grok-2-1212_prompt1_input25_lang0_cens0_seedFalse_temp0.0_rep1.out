Based on the provided statement, the most severe lesion is found in either Sample (1) or Sample (2) as they both contain tumor tissue with Gleason scores. To determine the most severe lesion, we compare the Gleason scores:

- Sample (1): Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%) which can be interpreted as 4+3=7.
- Sample (2): Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (<35%) which can be interpreted as 4+3=7.

Both samples have the same Gleason score of 4+3=7, indicating they are equally severe. However, for the purpose of this task, we will report on Sample (1) as it is mentioned first in the text.

Here is the structured JSON output based on Sample (1):

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
