Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of a "widely spread tumor" confirms malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the dominant Gleason class as 3 with class 4 differentiation being almost as prevalent. According to Gleason scoring conventions, the most common (dominant) pattern is listed first, followed by the second most common pattern. Therefore, the Gleason score should be reported as "4+3=7", reflecting the most severe lesion as per the instructions.
