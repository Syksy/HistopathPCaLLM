Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly. It mentions "prostate" but does not indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or another type. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions a possible 'Gleason sum 7' but states that it is unclear and cannot be verified due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a possible 'Gleason sum 7' but indicates uncertainty about the specific Gleason grades and whether the sum was verified. Due to this ambiguity and the impact of recent radiation therapy on the assessment, the value is set to "NA".
