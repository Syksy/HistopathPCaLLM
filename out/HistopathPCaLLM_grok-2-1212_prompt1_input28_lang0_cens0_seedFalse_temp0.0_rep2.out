Based on the provided statement and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders," indicating that the original sample type is a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, hence the value is "yes."
- **Gleason**: The most severe lesion mentioned is in "Focus #1" with a Gleason score of "4+4=8," which is higher than the other reported scores of "4+3=7" and "3+4=7." Therefore, "4+4=8" is reported as it represents the highest grade malignant finding.
