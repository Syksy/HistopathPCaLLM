Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate was obtained as a "fresh sample specimen" with a weight of approximately 40g. This indicates that the sample is from a radical prostatectomy (RP), as biopsy samples are typically much smaller and TURP samples are not described in this manner.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma," confirming malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the tumor as having "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern" with a "smaller portion as grade 4," which can be interpreted as a Gleason score of 4+3. The summary mentions a "Score sum 7 finding," which aligns with the Gleason score of 4+3=7.
