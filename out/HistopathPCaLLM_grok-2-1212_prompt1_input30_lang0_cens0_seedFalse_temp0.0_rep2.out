Based on the provided statement and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells," which suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the most common pattern as grade 4 and the secondary pattern as grade 3, resulting in a Gleason score of 4+3=7. Although a tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned, the Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary and secondary patterns.
