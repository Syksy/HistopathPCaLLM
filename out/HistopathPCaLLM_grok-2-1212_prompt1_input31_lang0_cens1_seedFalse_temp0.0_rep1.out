Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "necessary samples were taken" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, the value is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspicious findings" but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is "NA".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no confirmation of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, the value is "NA".
