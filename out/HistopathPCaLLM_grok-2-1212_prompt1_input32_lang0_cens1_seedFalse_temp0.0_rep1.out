Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the original sample type explicitly among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), hence "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
- There is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the prostate itself; the statement only mentions that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, hence "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
- Since there is no mention of any Gleason grade in the statement, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
