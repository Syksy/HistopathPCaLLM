Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe," which implies that the samples were taken via biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes high-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) and hyperplasia, but no explicit mention of adenocarcinoma or any other malignant tumor. High-grade PIN is considered a precursor but not a malignancy itself. Therefore, the value is set to "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since no malignant tumor was identified, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus the value is set to "NA."
