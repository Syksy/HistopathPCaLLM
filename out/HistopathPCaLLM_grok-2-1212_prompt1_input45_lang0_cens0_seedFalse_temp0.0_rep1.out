Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate as sample," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and specific mention of "tissue gleason" indicate that there are malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "classes 3+4," which refers to the Gleason grades. The sum of these grades is 7, so the Gleason score is reported as "3+4=7".
