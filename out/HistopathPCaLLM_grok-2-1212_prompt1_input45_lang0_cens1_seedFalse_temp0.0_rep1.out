Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly. It mentions a "suspect prostate sample" but does not indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate), or another type. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. It mentions that the structure is unclear and further inspection is needed, but no definitive diagnosis of malignancy is provided. Hence, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade mentioned, the value is set to "NA".
