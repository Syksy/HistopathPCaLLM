Based on the provided histopathological statement and the instructions given, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy," which corresponds to the allowed value "RP."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of cancerous tissue, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies two different Gleason scores within the apex macros. The most severe lesion is described in macro B with a Gleason score of 4+5=9, which is higher than the score of 4+3=7 mentioned in macro A. Therefore, "4+5=9" is reported as it represents the most severe lesion.
