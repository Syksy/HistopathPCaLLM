Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy," which corresponds to "RP" in the allowed values.
- **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of cancerous tissue, hence "yes."
- **Gleason**: The most severe lesion reported is in macro B with a Gleason score of 4+5=9, which is higher than the score reported in macro A (4+3=7). Therefore, the Gleason score for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9."
