Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only describes the processing and indexing of the samples. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings," suggesting no malignant findings. Hence, the value is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since no malignancy was found, and it is stated that "Major and minor Gleason classes... could not be inferred," the Gleason grade is set to "NA".
