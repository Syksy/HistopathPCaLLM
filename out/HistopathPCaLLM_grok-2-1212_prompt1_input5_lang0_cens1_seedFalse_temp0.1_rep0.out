Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only describes the processing and indexing of the samples. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings," suggesting no malignant findings. Hence, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating that no Gleason grade could be determined. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
