Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: Although there is a mention of a focus suggesting adenocarcinoma, the statement clearly indicates that the finding remains at the suspicion level and no clear conclusive finding can be drawn. Therefore, the malignancy is reported as "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since the finding is not conclusive and remains at the suspicion level, no Gleason grade is reported, hence it is "NA."
