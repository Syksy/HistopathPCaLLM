Based on the provided statement and the instructions, the structured JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" in sample 3, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of tumor tissue in the prostatectomy sample, hence "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the highest identified Gleason growth pattern as "4+3=7", which is reported for the malignant findings.
