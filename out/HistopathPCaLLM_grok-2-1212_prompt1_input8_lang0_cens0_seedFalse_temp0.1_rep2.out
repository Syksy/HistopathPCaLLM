Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" in Sample 3, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of tumor tissue in the prostatectomy sample, hence "yes".
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies the highest identified Gleason score as "4+3=7", which is reported for the malignant findings in the prostatectomy sample.
