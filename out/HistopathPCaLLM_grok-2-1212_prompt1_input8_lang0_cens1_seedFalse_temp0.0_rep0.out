Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "samples" and "indices" without specifying the type. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings". For sample 3, there is a mention of "potentially interesting properties" and "varying growth patterns", but no definitive malignant findings are confirmed. There is a mention of "suspicion of PIN-changes", but PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is not considered a malignant finding. Therefore, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and "no grade score is reported". Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
