Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "samples" and "indices" without specifying the procedure. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings". For sample 3, while there is mention of "potentially interesting properties" and "varying growth patterns", there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. Additionally, the highest identified Gleason patterns are reported as missing, and there is a mention of suspicion of PIN-changes but no confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields for major and minor patterns, and no grade score reported. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
