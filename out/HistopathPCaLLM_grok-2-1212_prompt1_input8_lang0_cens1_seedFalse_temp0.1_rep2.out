Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the most severe lesion described would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "samples" and "indices" without specifying the procedure. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples in indices 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings". Although there is mention of "potentially interesting properties" and "varying growth patterns" in sample 3, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. The mention of "PIN-changes" (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) does not necessarily indicate malignancy. Therefore, based on the available information, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and "no grade score is reported". Therefore, the Gleason grade is set to "NA" as there is no valid reported Gleason score.
