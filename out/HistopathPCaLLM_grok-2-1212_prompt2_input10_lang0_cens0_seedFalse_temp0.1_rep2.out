Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate systematic biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." This suggests that there is no definitive malignant finding, hence the value is "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade mentioned, the value is "NA."
