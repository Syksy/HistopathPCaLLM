Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given text would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material" without further classification, hence "NA" is used.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "normal basal cells" and does not indicate any presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no mention of any malignant findings or Gleason grading, the value is "NA".
