Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions "prostate samples" without further classification, hence "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "normal basal cells" and does not indicate any presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no mention of any malignant findings or Gleason grading, the value is "NA".
