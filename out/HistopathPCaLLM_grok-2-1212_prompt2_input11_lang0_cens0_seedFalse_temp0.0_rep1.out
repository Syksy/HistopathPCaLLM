Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed," confirming the presence of a malignant tumor, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a "Gleason grading 4+3," which can be formatted as "4+3=7" according to the required format for malignant statements.
