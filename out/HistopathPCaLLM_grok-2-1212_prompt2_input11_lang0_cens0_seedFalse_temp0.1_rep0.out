Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive tumor tissue," confirming malignant findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a Gleason grading of "4+3," which sums up to 7, hence the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".
