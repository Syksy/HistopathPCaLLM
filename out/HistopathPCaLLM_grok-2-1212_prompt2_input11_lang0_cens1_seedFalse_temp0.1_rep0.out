Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions "Prepared sampleset" without specifying the origin, hence it is classified as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. It mentions "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and "high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive," but does not confirm malignancy, hence it is classified as "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3," but it also states that these "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, without a reliable assessment, the Gleason grade is classified as "NA".
