Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of carcinoma in sample B indicates malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a Gleason score of 9, composed of 4+5, which is reported for the most severe lesion. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+5=9."
