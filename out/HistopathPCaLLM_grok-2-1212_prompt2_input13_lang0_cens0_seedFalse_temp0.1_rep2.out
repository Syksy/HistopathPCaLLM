Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of carcinoma mentioned in the statement confirms that there are malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the Gleason score as "9 (4+5)," which indicates the major grade as 4, the minor grade as 5, and the sum as 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+5=9."
