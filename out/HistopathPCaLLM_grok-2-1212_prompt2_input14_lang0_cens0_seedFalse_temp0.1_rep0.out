Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "tumorous growth" and "found tumors," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." This indicates a Gleason score of 3+4=7, where the major component is 3 and the minor component is 4, summing up to 7.
