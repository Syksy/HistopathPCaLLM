Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prostate tissue" and "cassettes" but does not fit into the predefined categories.
- There is no clear mention of malignant tumor findings. The statement talks about "special patterns of cell growth" but does not confirm malignancy.
- The Gleason grade is mentioned in a comparative context ("a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient") but not directly associated with the current patient's findings. Therefore, it cannot be used to report the Gleason grade for this case.

Given these points, the most appropriate structured response is to use "NA" for all fields as the statement does not provide the necessary information to fill them accurately.
