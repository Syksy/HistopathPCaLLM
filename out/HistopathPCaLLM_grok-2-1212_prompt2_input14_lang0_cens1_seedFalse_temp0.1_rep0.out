Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prostate tissue" and "cassettes" but does not fit into the predefined categories, hence "NA".
- There is no clear mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement. It talks about "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further investigation, but does not confirm malignancy, hence "NA".
- The statement mentions a "Gleason 7 score" but in the context of a comparison to another patient, not as a direct finding from the current sample. Therefore, it cannot be used to report the Gleason grade for this specific case, hence "NA".
