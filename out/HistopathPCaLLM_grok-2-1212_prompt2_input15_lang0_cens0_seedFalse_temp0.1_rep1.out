Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings," which typically refers to a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is identified as "TURP."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma throughout the sample material, indicating malignant tumor findings. Thus, the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies that Gleason 4 is the most represented grade along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. Assuming the most severe lesion's Gleason score, it would be interpreted as "4+4=8."
