Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given text would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only refers to "prostate tissue material" without specifying the method of collection. Therefore, the value is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions a "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor based on histopathology. It states that findings need to be revised in the next session. Therefore, the value is "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above but clarifies that this is not based on histopathology and that a representative Gleason could not be determined at this time. Therefore, the value is "NA".
