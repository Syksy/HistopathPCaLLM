Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only mentions "prostate tissue material" without further classification, hence it is categorized as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor through histopathological examination. Therefore, it is categorized as "NA".
- **Gleason**: The statement indicates that a representative Gleason grade could not be determined at the time of the report. Although there is a mention of a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above based on clinical notes, this is not confirmed by histopathology, hence it is categorized as "NA".
