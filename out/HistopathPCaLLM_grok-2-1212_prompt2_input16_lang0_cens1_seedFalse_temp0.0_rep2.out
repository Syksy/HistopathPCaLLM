Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
- There is no clear mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement; it only discusses the difficulty in assessing the samples due to digitalization issues, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
- The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade, only mentioning that grading should be done manually and that mid-grade differentiation would be difficult to assess, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
