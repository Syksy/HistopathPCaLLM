Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and descriptions of tumor infiltration indicate malignant tumor findings, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." According to Gleason scoring conventions, the most common grade (4) is listed first, followed by the second most common grade (3), and their sum (7). Therefore, the Gleason score is reported as "4+3=7."
