Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure," which indicates a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies a Gleason score of 4+3=7, as the larger fraction (60%) is stage 3 (Gleason grade 4), and the remaining would be stage 3 or less (Gleason grade 3).
