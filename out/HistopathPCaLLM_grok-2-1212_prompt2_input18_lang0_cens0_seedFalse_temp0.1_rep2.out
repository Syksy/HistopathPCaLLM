Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure," which is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Hence, the malignancy field is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies a Gleason grade of 4+3=7, where the major component (60%) is Gleason pattern 4 and the minor component is Gleason pattern 3.
