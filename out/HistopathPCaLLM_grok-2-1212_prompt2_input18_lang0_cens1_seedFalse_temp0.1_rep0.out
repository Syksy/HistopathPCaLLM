Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of procedure used to obtain the sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, the sample type is classified as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that over 95% of the material appears benign, and the suspicious focus is too small to properly assign a grade group. Therefore, it is classified as "no" for malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: Since the suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade group and over 95% of the material is benign, the Gleason grade is classified as "NA".
