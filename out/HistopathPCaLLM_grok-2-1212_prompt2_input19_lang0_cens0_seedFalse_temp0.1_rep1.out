Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement specifies the presence of adenocarcinoma in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grades in sample 4 as 3 (90%) and 4 (10%). According to the convention, the Gleason score is reported as "major+minor=sum," where the major grade is the one that occupies the larger area. Therefore, the Gleason score is "3+4=7."
