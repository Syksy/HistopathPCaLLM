Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "needle biopsies," which indicates that the original sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes that "only benign-like growth is observed," indicating no malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates benign growth and no mention of any Gleason grade, the value is "NA."
