Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the statement does not provide clear information about the sample type, presence of malignancy, or a specific Gleason grade. The statement mentions that the results are inconclusive and additional inspection is required. Therefore, the structured JSON output should reflect the lack of definitive information as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
