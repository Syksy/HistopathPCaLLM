Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy resection," which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of adenocarcinoma in the sample indicates malignant tumor findings, hence "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports two different Gleason scores: "3+4" at the apex and "4+4" at the basis. Since we are to report the most severe lesion, we choose "4+4". The sum of 4+4 is 8, so the reported Gleason grade is "4+4=8".
