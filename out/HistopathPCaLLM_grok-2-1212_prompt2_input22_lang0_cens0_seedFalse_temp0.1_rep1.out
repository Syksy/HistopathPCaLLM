Based on the provided histopathological statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output should reflect the most severe lesion found in the sample. In this case, the most severe lesion is described on the left side of the prostate biopsy.

Here is the structured JSON output:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of carcinoma on the left side, indicating malignant findings.
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies the Gleason scores as 3 and 4 for the carcinoma on the left side. According to the rules, the Gleason grade should be reported as "major+minor=sum," which in this case is "3+4=7." This represents the most severe lesion as per the statement.
