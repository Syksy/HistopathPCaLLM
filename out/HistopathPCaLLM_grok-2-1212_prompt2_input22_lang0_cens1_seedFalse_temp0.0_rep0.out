Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given text would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the original sample type as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" but does not categorize it into the specified types, hence "NA" is used.
- There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. It mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies," which leads to the conclusion that there is no definitive information on malignancy, hence "NA" is used.
- The statement indicates difficulty in assigning a Gleason score due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for proof-checking the origin of the material. Therefore, no Gleason grade can be reported, resulting in "NA".
