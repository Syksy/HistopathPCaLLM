Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given text would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the original sample type as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" but does not categorize it into the specified types, hence "NA" is used.
- There is no clear mention of malignant tumor findings. The statement indicates that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies," leading to an "NA" for Malignancy.
- The statement mentions difficulty in assigning a Gleason score due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for proof-checking, indicating that no valid Gleason grade can be reported, hence "NA" for Gleason.
