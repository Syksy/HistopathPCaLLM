Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of adenocarcinoma confirms malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the Gleason score sum as 9, with the primary grade being 4 (60%) and the secondary grade being 5 (30%). Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+5=9".
