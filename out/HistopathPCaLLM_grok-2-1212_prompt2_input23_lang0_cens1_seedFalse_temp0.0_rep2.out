Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the original sample type as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prepared sample set" and "selected subset of samples," but these do not match the allowed values, hence "NA" is used.
- There is no definitive statement about the presence of malignant tumor findings in the provided text. It mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" from a prior incomplete report, but this is not confirmed in the current statement, hence "NA" is used.
- The Gleason grade mentioned is from a prior incomplete report and not confirmed in the current statement. Therefore, it cannot be considered a valid reported Gleason grade for the current sample, hence "NA" is used.
