Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of a malignant tumor, specifically mentioning "adenocarcinoma" and "malignant suspicion."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Given that the Gleason score is typically reported as major+minor=sum, and considering the most severe lesion, the Gleason score can be interpreted as 4+4=8.
