Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of a malignant tumor, specifically mentioning "malignant suspicion" and "adenocarcinoma."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Given that the Gleason score is typically reported as "major+minor=sum," and considering the most severe lesion, the structured format would be "4+4=8" as this represents a possible configuration for a sum of 8 with Gleason 4 being the predominant pattern.
