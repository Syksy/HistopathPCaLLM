Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify a single, most severe lesion but rather discusses multiple sets of samples used for teaching purposes.
- It mentions both biopsies and radical prostatectomies but does not focus on a specific sample type for a particular case.
- The statement indicates that some benign cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, but it does not specify which sample type these upgrades were associated with, nor does it indicate a single most severe lesion.
- There is no clear indication of malignancy in a specific case, as the focus is on the educational aspect and the upgrading of benign cases.
- The Gleason scores mentioned (3+3 and 3+4) are not linked to a specific, most severe lesion but rather to the general upgrading of cases.

Given these points, the most appropriate structured response is to use "NA" for all fields, as the statement does not provide the necessary specific details about a single, most severe lesion.
