Based on the provided histopathological statement, the most severe lesion is found in either Sample (1) or Sample (2) as they both contain malignant findings, while Sample (3) does not. To determine the most severe lesion, we compare the Gleason scores of Samples (1) and (2).

- Sample (1) has Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%), which can be interpreted as a Gleason score of 4+3=7.
- Sample (2) has Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (less than 35%), which can be interpreted as a Gleason score of 4+3=7.

Both samples have the same Gleason score, so either could be considered the most severe lesion. However, for the purpose of this task, we will select Sample (1) as it is mentioned first in the text.

The structured JSON output based on Sample (1) would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The samples are described as tissue cylinders, which implies they are from a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant findings.
- **Gleason**: The Gleason score for Sample (1) is calculated as 4+3=7 based on the provided percentages of Gleason patterns.
