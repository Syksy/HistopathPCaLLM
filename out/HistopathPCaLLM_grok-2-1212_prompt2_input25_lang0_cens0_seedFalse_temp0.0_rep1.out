Based on the provided histopathological statement, the most severe lesion is found in either Sample (1) or Sample (2) as they both contain malignant findings, while Sample (3) does not. To determine the most severe lesion, we compare the Gleason scores of Samples (1) and (2).

For Sample (1), the Gleason score is calculated as follows:
- Gleason 4 pattern: 20%
- Gleason 3 pattern: 30%
The major pattern is 3 (30% > 20%), and the minor pattern is 4, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

For Sample (2), the Gleason score is calculated as follows:
- Gleason 4 pattern: 15%
- Gleason 3 pattern: less than 35%
The major pattern is 3 (less than 35% > 15%), and the minor pattern is 4, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Both samples have the same Gleason score of 3+4=7. However, Sample (2) has a slightly higher percentage of the major pattern (less than 35% vs. 30% in Sample 1), which could be considered more severe. Therefore, we will use Sample (2) for the structured data.

The structured JSON output based on the statement is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "tissue cylinders" and "samples," which are indicative of a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant findings.
- **Gleason**: As explained above, the most severe lesion (Sample 2) has a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
