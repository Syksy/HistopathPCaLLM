Based on the provided histopathological statement, the most severe lesion is found in either Sample (1) or Sample (2), as Sample (3) shows no abnormal prostate tissue. Both Sample (1) and Sample (2) contain tumor growth with Gleason scores, but Sample (2) has a slightly higher percentage of Gleason pattern 3 (less than 35% compared to 30% in Sample 1), making it the most severe lesion based on the information given.

Here is the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The samples are described as tissue cylinders, which indicates they are from a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings.
- **Gleason**: The most severe lesion is in Sample (2), with Gleason pattern 4 at approximately 15% and pattern 3 at less than 35%. The standard way to report Gleason scores is to list the most prevalent pattern first, followed by the second most prevalent pattern, and then their sum. Therefore, the Gleason score for Sample (2) is reported as "4+3=7".
