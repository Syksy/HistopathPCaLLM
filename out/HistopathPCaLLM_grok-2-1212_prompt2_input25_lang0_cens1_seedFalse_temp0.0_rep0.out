Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of the original sample as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It only mentions "tissue sample" and "fragmented tissue material" without specifying the procedure used to obtain the samples. Therefore, the value is "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified based on the samples provided. Hence, there is no definitive information on whether there were malignant tumor findings, leading to a value of "NA".
- **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason differentiation patterns but does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It also indicates that the case will be discussed further, suggesting that a final Gleason grade has not been determined. Therefore, the value is "NA".
