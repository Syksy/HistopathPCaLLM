Based on the provided statement and the criteria for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of the original sample as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It mentions "tissue sample" and "fragmented tissue material" but does not fit into the allowed values, hence it is categorized as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified based on the samples provided. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm malignant tumor findings, resulting in "NA".
- **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason differentiation patterns but does not provide a specific Gleason grade in the required format ("major+minor=sum"). It also states that the case will be discussed further, indicating uncertainty. Thus, the Gleason grade is "NA".
