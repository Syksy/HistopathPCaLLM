Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "widely spread tumor," confirming the presence of malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies that "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." According to Gleason grading conventions, when two grades are mentioned with one being dominant and the other almost as prevalent, the higher grade is typically reported as the primary (major) grade and the lower grade as the secondary (minor) grade. Therefore, the Gleason score would be reported as "4+3=7".
