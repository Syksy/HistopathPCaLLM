Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "widely spread tumor," confirming the presence of malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies that "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." This suggests a Gleason score of 3+4=7, where 3 is the major grade and 4 is the minor grade.
