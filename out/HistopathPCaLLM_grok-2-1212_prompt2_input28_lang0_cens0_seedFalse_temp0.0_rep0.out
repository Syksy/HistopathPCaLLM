```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders," indicating that the original sample type is a "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, hence "yes."
