Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data focusing on the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders," indicating that the original sample type is a biopsy.
- **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, hence the value is "yes."
- **Gleason**: The statement specifies that the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with a Gleason score of 4+4=8. This is the most severe lesion mentioned, and thus, it is the value reported in the structured data.
