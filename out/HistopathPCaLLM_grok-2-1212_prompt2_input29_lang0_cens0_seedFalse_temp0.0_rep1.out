Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen with a weight of approximately 40g. This indicates that the sample type is from a radical prostatectomy (RP), as biopsy samples are typically much smaller and TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) samples are not described in this manner.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma, confirming malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the tumor as having mostly grade 4 differentiation with a smaller portion also as grade 4, which suggests a Gleason pattern of 4+3. The summary confirms a score sum of 7, which aligns with the Gleason score of 4+3=7.
