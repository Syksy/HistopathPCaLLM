Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "normal benign growth" with no mention of any malignant tumor. It also states that "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth," confirming the absence of malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable and thus marked as "NA".
