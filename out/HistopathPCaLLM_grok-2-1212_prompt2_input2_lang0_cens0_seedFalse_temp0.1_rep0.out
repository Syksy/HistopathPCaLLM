Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "fresh prostatectomy specimen," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "normal benign growth" with no mention of any malignant tumor. Therefore, the value for malignancy is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no mention of any malignant tumor or Gleason grade in the statement, the value for Gleason is "NA".
