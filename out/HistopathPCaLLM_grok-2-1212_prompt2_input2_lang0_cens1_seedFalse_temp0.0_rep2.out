Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the sample is from an autopsy specimen intended for research use. However, none of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP") directly apply to an autopsy sample. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes, indicating that no definitive malignant findings are reported. Thus, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: No specific Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement. The statement only suggests the need for further inspection to potentially identify adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
