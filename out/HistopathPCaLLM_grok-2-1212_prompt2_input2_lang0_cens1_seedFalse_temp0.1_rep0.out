Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the sample is from an autopsy specimen intended for research use. However, none of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP") directly apply to an autopsy specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes, but no definitive statement about malignancy is made. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: No specific Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
