Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the sample is from an autopsy specimen intended for research use. However, none of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP") directly match "autopsy". Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. **Gleason**: There is no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

This JSON structure reflects the most severe lesion's information based on the provided statement, adhering to the specified rules and allowed values.
