Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells," which suggests that the sample type is from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a differentiation of grade 4 as the most common pattern and grade 3 as the secondary pattern. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7". The tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned but not included in the sum as per standard reporting practices.
