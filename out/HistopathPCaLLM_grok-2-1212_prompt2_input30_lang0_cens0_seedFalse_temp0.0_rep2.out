Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells," which suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies the most common pattern as grade 4 and the secondary pattern as grade 3, resulting in a Gleason score of 4+3=7. The tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned but does not affect the primary and secondary pattern sum, which is used for the Gleason score reporting in this context.
