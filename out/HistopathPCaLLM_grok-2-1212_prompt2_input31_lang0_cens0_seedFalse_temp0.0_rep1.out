Based on the provided histopathological statement, the most severe lesion described is from the second targeted biopsy. Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of a large focus with specific Gleason patterns indicates malignant tumor findings, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The most severe lesion described in the statement is from the second targeted biopsy, with a primary differentiation pattern of 4 and a secondary pattern of 5, leading to a Gleason sum of 9. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+5=9."
