Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the patient underwent a "radical prostatectomy," which corresponds to the "RP" value.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," indicating malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies various Gleason patterns, but the most severe (highest sum) is "Gleason 4+4," which results in a sum of 8. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8."
