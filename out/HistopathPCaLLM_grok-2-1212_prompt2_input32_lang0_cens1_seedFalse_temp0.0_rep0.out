Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other specific type, hence "Sampletype" is "NA".
- There is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
- No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, thus "Gleason" is "NA".
