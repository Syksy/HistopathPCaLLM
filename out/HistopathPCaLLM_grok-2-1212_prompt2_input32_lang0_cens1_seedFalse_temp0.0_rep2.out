Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the original sample type clearly as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP").
- There is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement.
- No Gleason grade is reported in the statement.

Therefore, all fields are assigned the value "NA" as per the instructions.
