Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of a tumor penetrating the capsule and the mention of Gleason types indicate malignant findings, hence "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason types as "3+4/4+3". The most severe lesion based on Gleason score is "4+3", which sums to 7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".
