Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of a tumor with "Tumor has penetrated the capsule," confirming malignant findings, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason types as "3+4/4+3." According to the instructions, the most severe lesion should be reported. The more aggressive pattern is "4+3," which sums to 7, so the Gleason grade reported should be "4+3=7."
