Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "resection," which typically refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP) in the context of prostate cancer.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities," indicating no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable and thus marked as "NA".
