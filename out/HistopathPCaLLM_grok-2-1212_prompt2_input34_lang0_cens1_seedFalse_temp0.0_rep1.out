Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of the original sample clearly as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". It only mentions a sample prepared into tissue cassettes, hence "NA" is used.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "findings do not indicate prostatic" and mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation", which suggests no malignant tumor findings, hence "no" is used.
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant findings mentioned, the Gleason grade is not applicable, hence "NA" is used.
