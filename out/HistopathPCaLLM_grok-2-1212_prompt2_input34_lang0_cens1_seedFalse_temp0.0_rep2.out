Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is classified as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" and does not indicate any malignant findings. Hence, it is classified as "no".
- **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable and is classified as "NA".
