Based on the provided statement, the structured JSON output for the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of a tumor with specified Gleason grades indicates malignant findings, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies Gleason 3 as the major grade and 4 as the minor grade, resulting in a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
