Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output for the given histopathological statement would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which typically refers to tissue obtained from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is identified as "TURP."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "Nothing indicating malignancy is found," indicating that there are no malignant tumor findings, hence the value is "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus the value is "NA."
