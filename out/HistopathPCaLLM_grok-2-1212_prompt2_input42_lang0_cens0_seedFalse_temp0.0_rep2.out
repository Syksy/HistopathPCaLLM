Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of Gleason grades and a score indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, hence "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies "Summary: score 7 (4+3)," which directly provides the Gleason grade in the required format of "major+minor=sum", resulting in "4+3=7".
