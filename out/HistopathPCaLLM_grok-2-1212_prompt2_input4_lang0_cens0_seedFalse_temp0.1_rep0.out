Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, so the malignancy value is "no."
3. **Gleason**: Since the samples are benign, there is no Gleason grade reported, so the value is "NA."
