Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy," which corresponds to the "RP" value.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of cancerous tissue, hence "yes."
3. **Gleason**: The most severe lesion mentioned is in macro B with a Gleason score of 4+5=9, which is higher than the 4+3=7 reported in macro A. Therefore, "4+5=9" is reported as it represents the most severe finding.
