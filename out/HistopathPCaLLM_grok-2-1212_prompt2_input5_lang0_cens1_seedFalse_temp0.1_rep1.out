Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only describes the processing of the prostate sample, so the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings," suggesting no malignant findings, hence the value is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating that no Gleason grade could be determined, so the value is set to "NA".
