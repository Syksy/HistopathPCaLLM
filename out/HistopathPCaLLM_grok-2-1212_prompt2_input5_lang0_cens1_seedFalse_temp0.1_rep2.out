Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of the original sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It only describes the processing and observation of the prostate tissue, hence "NA" is used.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings," suggesting no malignant findings, hence "no" is used.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating that no Gleason grade could be determined, hence "NA" is used.
