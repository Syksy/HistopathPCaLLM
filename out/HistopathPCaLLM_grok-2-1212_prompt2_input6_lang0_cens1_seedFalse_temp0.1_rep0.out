Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the original sample type as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "prostatic operation material" but does not specify further, hence "NA" is used.
- There is no mention of any malignant tumor findings in the statement. It only mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures" and does not conclude on the presence of malignancy, hence "NA" is used.
- No Gleason grade is reported in the statement, hence "NA" is used.
