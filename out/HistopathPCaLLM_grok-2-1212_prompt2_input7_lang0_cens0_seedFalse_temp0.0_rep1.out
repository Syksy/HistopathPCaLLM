Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which clearly indicates that the original sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: Although there is a mention of a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, the statement specifies that the finding is too small to draw clear conclusions and remains at the suspicion level. Therefore, it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor, leading to a "no" for malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: Since the malignancy is not confirmed and no Gleason grade is mentioned or can be inferred from the statement, the value for Gleason is "NA."
