Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which clearly indicates that the original sample type is a "biopsy."
2. **Malignancy**: Although there is a mention of a focus suggesting adenocarcinoma, the statement specifies that the finding is too small to draw clear conclusions and remains at the suspicion level. Therefore, it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor, leading to a "no" for malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide any Gleason grade information, the value for Gleason is "NA."
