Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data focusing on the most severe lesion would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate" in Sample 3, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of tumor tissue in the prostatectomy sample, hence "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The highest identified Gleason score mentioned is "4+3=7", which is reported for the tumor findings in the prostatectomy sample.
