Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" which implies that these are biopsy samples. Therefore, the sample type is identified as "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Additionally, for Sample 3, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy; instead, it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and "Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed," which does not confirm malignancy. Therefore, the most severe lesion reported does not confirm malignancy, leading to "no" for malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." Since no specific Gleason score is provided and it is explicitly stated as missing, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
