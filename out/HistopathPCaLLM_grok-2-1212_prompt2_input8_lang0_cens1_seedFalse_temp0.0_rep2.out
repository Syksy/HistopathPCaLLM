Based on the provided statement and the rules for structuring the data, the JSON output should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of the original sample as one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). It mentions "samples" and "prostate tissue" but does not categorize them into the specified types. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Although it discusses potentially interesting properties and histological properties in sample 3, it does not confirm malignancy. The highest identified Gleason patterns are missing, and no grade score is reported, which suggests no confirmed malignancy. Therefore, the value is set to "no".

3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates that the highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing with empty fields for major and minor, and no grade score is reported. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
