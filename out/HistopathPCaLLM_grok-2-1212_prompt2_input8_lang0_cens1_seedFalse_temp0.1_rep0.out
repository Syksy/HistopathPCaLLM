Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" which implies that these are biopsy samples. Therefore, the sample type is identified as "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Additionally, for Sample 3, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy; instead, it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and "no grade score is reported," which suggests no definitive malignant findings. Therefore, the value for malignancy is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." Since no specific Gleason score is provided and it is stated that no grade score is reported, the value for Gleason is "NA".
