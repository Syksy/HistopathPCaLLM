Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" which implies that these are biopsy samples as they are referred to as samples and not specifically as radical prostatectomy (RP) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is identified as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Additionally, for Sample 3, while there is mention of "potentially interesting properties" and "varying growth patterns," there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy. The highest identified Gleason patterns are noted as missing, and no grade score is reported. Therefore, the most severe lesion does not confirm malignancy, leading to a "no" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason**: The statement indicates that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." Since no specific Gleason grade is provided and it is noted as missing, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
