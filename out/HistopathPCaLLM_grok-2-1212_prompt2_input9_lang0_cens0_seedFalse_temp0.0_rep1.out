Based on the provided histopathological statement, the structured data in JSON format would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed," indicating that there are no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable and thus marked as "NA".
