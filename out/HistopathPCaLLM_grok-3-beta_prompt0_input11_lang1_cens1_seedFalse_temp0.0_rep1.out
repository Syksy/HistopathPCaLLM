y, let's structure the data from the given text into the requested JSON format. I'll analyze the provided histopathological statement about prostate cancer and extract the relevant information based on the specified fields.

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_score": "NA"
}
```

**Explanation of the structured output:**
1. **Sample Type**: The text does not explicitly mention whether the sample is a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Therefore, I have assigned the value "NA" as per the allowed options.
2. **Malignant Findings**: The text does not clearly state whether malignant findings were present or absent. It mentions prostate tissue with tubular structures and varying differentiation but does not confirm malignancy. Hence, I have set this to "NA".
3. **Gleason Score**: Although the text refers to Gleason components (values 4 and 3), it explicitly states that these cannot be reliably assessed due to the limited material (only 5% examined). As a result, no definitive Gleason score can be reported, and the value is set to "NA".
