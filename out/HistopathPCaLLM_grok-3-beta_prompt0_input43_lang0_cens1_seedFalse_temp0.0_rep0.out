 there! I've analyzed the provided histopathological statement about prostate cancer and structured the data into JSON format based on the specified fields and constraints. Here's the result focusing on the most severe lesion (or lack thereof in this case):

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not specify if it's a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). Therefore, I assigned it as "NA" since it doesn't match the allowed values.
2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The text states "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies no definitive malignant findings. Hence, I set this to "no."
3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no confirmed malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable and is set to "NA."

Let me know if you have more statements to process or need further clarification!
