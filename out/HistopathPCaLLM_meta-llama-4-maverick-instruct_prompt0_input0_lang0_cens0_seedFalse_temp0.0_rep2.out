To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g," which indicates the sample type. "Chipping samples" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in chips.
   - Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma."
   - This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings.
   - Therefore, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma," it implies the tissue is benign.
   - For benign statements, the Gleason grade is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no variation in severity).
