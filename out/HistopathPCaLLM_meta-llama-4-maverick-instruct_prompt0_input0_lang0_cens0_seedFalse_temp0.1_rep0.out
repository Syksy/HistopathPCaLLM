To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g," which indicates the sample is from a procedure that involves chipping or removing tissue in small pieces. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a procedure that fits this description, as it involves removing prostate tissue in chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that the tissue observed was benign and there's no mention of malignancy or carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for malignant prostate tissue. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the histopathological statement.
