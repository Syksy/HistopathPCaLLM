To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g," which indicates the sample is from a surgical procedure involving chipping or removing tissue. The term "chipping samples" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in chips.
   - Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma."
   - This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings.
   - Hence, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma," it implies the tissue is benign.
   - For benign statements, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not malignant) is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sampleType`: "TURP"
- `malignantFindings`: "no"
- `gleasonGrade`: "NA"
