To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g," which indicates the sample is from a surgical procedure involving chipping or removing tissue. The term "chipping samples" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in chips.
   - Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma."
   - This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma," it implies the tissue is benign.
   - For benign statements, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement.
