To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A lot sample material was obtained," and it refers to "prostate tissue." It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that a lot of material was obtained and run in multiple batches, and the mention of prostate tissue, it suggests a significant sample. However, without explicit mention, we must infer or directly state "NA" if not clearly indicated. The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined, not that it's definitively benign or malignant. Thus, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm the presence ("yes") or absence ("no") of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy and explicitly states that conclusions regarding malignancy or carcinoma cannot be drawn, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it's related to malignant statements.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers for the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity or presence of a lesion isn't confirmed). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
