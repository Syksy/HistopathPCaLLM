To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue" in the context of histological examination. It doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the mention of "multiple batches" and the context might imply a significant sample, but without specific procedural details, we must infer based on common practices. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the lack of specific information, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as we cannot accurately determine the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination did not yield conclusive results regarding malignancy. However, it does not directly state the presence or absence of malignancy. The closest interpretation is "NA" because the statement indicates an inability to make a determination regarding malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. The statement does not mention a Gleason score or grade, and given that it concludes with an inability to draw reliable conclusions regarding malignancy, it implies the sample was either not malignant or not evaluable for malignancy. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" as it's not applicable or not provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy couldn't be assessed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
