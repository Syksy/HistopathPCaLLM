To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue" in the context of histological examination. It doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the mention of "multiple batches" and the context might imply a significant sample, but without specific procedural details, we must infer based on common practices. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the lack of specific information, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as we cannot accurately determine the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination did not conclusively identify malignancy, but it also indicates that a definitive assessment regarding malignancy couldn't be made. However, the absence of a positive statement about malignancy and the mention of "some spot-like inflammation" and a suspicion of "benign prostate hyperplasia" suggests that there wasn't a clear indication of malignancy. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because there's no confirmation of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for grading prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. The statement clearly indicates that an inference about malignancy or carcinoma "cannot be conducted," which implies that a Gleason score was not provided or applicable. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since the statement is related to a case where malignancy assessment was not conclusive and likely not present.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the required fields based on the histopathological statement.
