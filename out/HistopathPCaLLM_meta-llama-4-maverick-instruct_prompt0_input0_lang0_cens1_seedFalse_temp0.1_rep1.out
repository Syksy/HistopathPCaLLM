To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A lot sample material was obtained," and it refers to "prostate tissue." It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that a lot of material was obtained and run in multiple batches, and it's related to prostate tissue, we can infer it's likely a significant sample. However, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves a significant amount of tissue. The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" with certainty. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" because the text doesn't clearly indicate the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. However, it doesn't directly state that there were malignant findings; instead, it suggests that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer grading. The statement doesn't mention a Gleason score or grade, and it indicates that the material was not conclusive for malignancy or carcinoma. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable here, and the answer should be "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (which, in this case, is not applicable due to the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding malignancy).
