To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue," but it doesn't directly specify the type of sample. However, it implies a significant amount of tissue was examined, which could be indicative of certain types of samples. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, TURP is a plausible guess because it often involves examining a substantial amount of prostate tissue. However, without explicit information, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly fit the typical descriptions of a biopsy (which is usually smaller) or RP (which is a whole gland examination). Since we can't conclusively determine the sample type from the given information, we'll have to consider it as "NA" (Not Available or Not Assessable) due to lack of specific details.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination did not yield conclusive results regarding malignancy. However, it does not directly state that there were no malignant findings; rather, it indicates that no determination could be made. Therefore, we should categorize this as "NA" because the presence or absence of malignancy wasn't determined.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for grading prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of... malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," which implies that there was no diagnosis of carcinoma, and hence, no Gleason grade was reported. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" since the statement is related to a case where malignancy couldn't be assessed.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
