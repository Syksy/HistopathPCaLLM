To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," indicating the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement discusses a "suspicious focus" but concludes that the diagnosis is "uncertain although leaning towards benign." This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer should be "no" since the suspicion is not confirmed.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as the suspicious focus is "too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma," and the diagnosis is leaning towards benign. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no confirmed malignancy.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall conclusion in this case, as there's no clear indication of multiple lesions with varying severity).
