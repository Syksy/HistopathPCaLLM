To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies." Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma" and concludes with "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." This implies that there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Hence, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because it leans towards benign and doesn't confirm carcinoma.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the diagnosis is uncertain and leans towards benign without a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA."

Now, let's structure these findings into valid JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall conclusion in this case, as there's no definitive malignancy diagnosed).
