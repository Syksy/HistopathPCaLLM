To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," indicating the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement discusses a "suspicious focus" but concludes that the diagnosis is "uncertain although leaning towards benign." This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer should be "no" since the suspicion is not confirmed.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it leans towards a benign diagnosis and does not confirm carcinoma. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall conclusion in this case, as there's no clear indication of multiple lesions with varying severity). The values are chosen based on the information provided in the histopathological statement.
