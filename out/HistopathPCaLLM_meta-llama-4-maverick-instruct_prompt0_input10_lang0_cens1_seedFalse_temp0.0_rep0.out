To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses prostate tissue material and the use of an immunological staining panel, which is common in biopsy samples. Despite this, the text does not directly indicate the sample type. Therefore, without explicit information, the most appropriate answer based on the context given would be "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue material and mentions the observation of "normal basal cells," which is often an indicator used to rule out malignancy in certain contexts because basal cells are typically absent in prostate adenocarcinoma. It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings but implies a benign condition by mentioning normal basal cells. However, it concludes with a "Suspicion of the staining immunopanel of prostate tissue failing in some of the samples," which indicates uncertainty. The presence of "suspicious formations" is mentioned, but it's related to the staining failing rather than a clear indication of malignancy. Thus, the statement does not conclusively indicate malignancy; hence, the answer leans towards "no" due to the implication of benign findings (presence of normal basal cells), despite the uncertainty around the staining.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. The statement does not provide a Gleason score or discuss the cancer's grade. It focuses on the issue with the immunostaining panel and mentions normal basal cells, suggesting a non-malignant or benign condition. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" since there's no indication of malignancy.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Not using nested structures.
- Providing answers for the most severe lesion (though the text does not directly discuss lesions, the implication is benign).
- Using the allowed values for each field.
