To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and that they arrived in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue material" and "prostate samples," which could imply biopsies, but it's not conclusive. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type being RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context, it seems more likely to be biopsies. However, the exact type isn't clearly stated, so we might lean towards "biopsy" as a reasonable guess due to the context of multiple samples, but it's not definitive.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue and mentions "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material." The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates benign tissue because basal cells are usually absent in prostate cancer. It also mentions "suspicious formations" but in the context of staining failing, not directly indicating cancer. The overall conclusion is about the suspicion of staining failure rather than a diagnosis of cancer. Therefore, based on the information given, it seems there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings. The statement does not directly say "no cancer," but the context suggests that the focus was on the quality of the staining rather than diagnosing cancer. Thus, we can infer "no" for malignant findings as there's no clear indication of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention a Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the mention of normal basal cells and the focus on staining issues, suggests that either the tissue was not malignant or the diagnosis of cancer wasn't the focus. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no indication of a malignant diagnosis.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it implies a general assessment of the samples), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the interpretation that the sample type is most likely "biopsy" due to the context, there were no confirmed malignant findings ("no"), and the Gleason grade is "NA" because there's no indication of a malignant diagnosis.
