To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses prostate tissue material and the use of an immunological staining panel, which is common in biopsy samples. Despite this, the text does not directly indicate the sample type. Therefore, without explicit information, the most appropriate answer based on the context given would be "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue material and mentions the observation of "normal basal cells," which is often an indicator used to rule out malignancy in certain contexts because basal cells are typically absent in prostate adenocarcinoma. It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings but implies a benign condition by mentioning normal basal cells. However, it concludes with a suspicion related to the staining immunopanel's reliability rather than directly stating the presence or absence of malignancy. The closest interpretation based on the information given (presence of normal basal cells and no direct mention of malignancy) would lean towards "no" for malignant findings, as there's no clear indication of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. The statement does not mention a Gleason score or grade, nor does it confirm the presence of cancer. It focuses on the issue with the staining immunopanel and mentions normal basal cells, suggesting a non-malignant condition. Therefore, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade in this context would be "NA" since there's no indication of malignancy.

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and values based on the most severe lesion (or the overall assessment in this case, as there's no indication of multiple lesions with varying severity).
