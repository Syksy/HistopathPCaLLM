To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses prostate tissue material and the use of an immunological staining panel, which is common in biopsy samples. Despite this, the text does not directly indicate the sample type. Therefore, without explicit information, the most appropriate answer based on the context given would be "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue material and mentions the observation of "normal basal cells," which is often an indicator used to rule out malignancy in certain contexts because basal cells are typically absent in prostate adenocarcinoma. It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings but implies a benign condition by mentioning normal basal cells. However, it concludes with a suspicion related to the staining immunopanel failing, not directly addressing malignancy. The presence of "suspicious formations" could imply a potential concern, but it's related to the staining issue rather than a clear indication of malignancy. Thus, the statement does not conclusively indicate malignant tumor findings. Given the information and the allowed values, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" or potentially "no" if we infer that the presence of normal basal cells and the lack of a clear malignancy statement leans towards a benign interpretation. However, "NA" is more cautious due to the ambiguity.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The discussion revolves around the reliability of an immunological staining panel and the observation of normal basal cells, without referencing Gleason scores. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as there's no information provided about the Gleason grade.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it implies a concern but doesn't clearly state malignancy or provide a Gleason score), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

Justification for choosing "no" over "NA" for "malignantTumorFindings": The presence of normal basal cells and the overall context suggest a benign condition, even though the statement is not definitive about malignancy status. The implication leans more towards a non-malignant interpretation due to the mention of normal basal cells, which are typically absent in malignant prostate tissue. Thus, "no" is selected under the assumption that the statement implies a benign condition based on available information.
