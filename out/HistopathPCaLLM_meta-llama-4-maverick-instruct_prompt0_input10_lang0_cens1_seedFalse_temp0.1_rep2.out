To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses prostate tissue material and the use of an immunological staining panel, which is common in biopsy samples. Despite this, the text does not directly indicate the sample type. Therefore, without explicit information, the most appropriate answer based on the context given would be "NA" due to the lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue material and mentions the observation of "normal basal cells." The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates benign tissue since basal cells are often absent in malignant prostate glands. It also mentions "suspicious formations" but clarifies that these hinted at "stainings failing" rather than indicating malignancy. The overall conclusion is a "suspicion of the staining immunopanel... failing" rather than a diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for grading prostate cancer based on biopsy samples. Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy and instead focuses on the issue with staining and the presence of normal basal cells, it does not provide a Gleason grade. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as the statement is not malignant.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not malignant), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements and provides the structured data derived from the given free-format text.
