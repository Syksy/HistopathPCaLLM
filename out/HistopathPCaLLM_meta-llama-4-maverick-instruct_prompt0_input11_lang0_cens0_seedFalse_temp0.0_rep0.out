To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample is from a radical prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "microscopically invasive tumor tissue" and describes a "malignant focus," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides a Gleason grading of "4+3" for the tumor. It does not explicitly state the sum, but based on the given numbers, the sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- `sampleType`: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
- `malignantFindings`: "yes" (Indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings)
- `gleasonGrade`: "4+3=7" (The reported Gleason grade for the malignant tumor)
