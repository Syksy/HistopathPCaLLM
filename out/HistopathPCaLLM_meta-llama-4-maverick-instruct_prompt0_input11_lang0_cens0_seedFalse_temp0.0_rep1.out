To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed" and describes a "malignant focus in the apex and central lobe." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides a Gleason grading of "4+3". It does not explicitly mention the sum, but based on the given numbers, the sum is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
