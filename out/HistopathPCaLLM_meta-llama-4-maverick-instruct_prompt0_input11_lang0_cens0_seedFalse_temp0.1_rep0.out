To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed" and describes a "malignant focus in the apex and central lobe." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides a Gleason grading as "4+3". To adhere to the "major+minor=sum" format, we need to understand that the Gleason score is calculated by adding the major and minor grades. Here, it is implied that the sum is 7 (4+3=7), so the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement.
