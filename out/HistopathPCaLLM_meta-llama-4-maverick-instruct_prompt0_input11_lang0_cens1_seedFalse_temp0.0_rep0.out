To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue" and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a significant amount of tissue was available for examination. It also mentions inspection of "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section." This level of detail is more typical of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP, as it implies a more extensive sampling of the prostate. However, the statement doesn't explicitly confirm it, and the percentage of material investigated seems low for an RP. Despite this, based on the detail given, we can infer it's likely not a biopsy. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a possibility but the detailed sectioning (basis, apex, mid section) is more suggestive of RP. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue... forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and discusses Gleason scores (3 and 4), which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings since Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that the fractions of these scores "could not be reliably assessed." Despite this, it implies that the tumor is malignant and refers to these scores. For prostate cancer, the Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns. Here, it seems the major and minor scores are 4 and 3, respectively, but the exact proportion or sum isn't provided. Assuming the major pattern is 4 and the minor is 3 (which is a common scenario for prostate cancer), the Gleason score would be "4+3=7". 

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
