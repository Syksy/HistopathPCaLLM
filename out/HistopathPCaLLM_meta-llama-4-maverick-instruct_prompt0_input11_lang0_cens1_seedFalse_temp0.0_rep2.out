To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which suggests a more extensive sample than a typical biopsy. It doesn't explicitly state it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP), but the detailed inspection hints towards it. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a possibility but less likely given the detailed anatomical description. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, we have to make an educated guess. Given the context, "RP" seems plausible, but without clear indication, it could also be considered as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue... forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages," which could imply malignancy since it talks about varying differentiation stages, a characteristic often associated with cancer. However, it doesn't directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The mention of "Gleason scores" (score 4 and score 3) strongly suggests that there are malignant cells, as Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that the fractions of these scores "could not be reliably assessed." Despite this, it implies that the Gleason score is relevant, suggesting malignancy. However, it doesn't provide a clear "major+minor=sum" format due to the inability to assess the fractions reliably. For the purpose of structuring, we might consider this as an attempt to provide a Gleason score, but since it's not conclusive, there might be a tendency to mark it as "NA". However, given that scores 3 and 4 are mentioned, a reasonable interpretation could be "3+4=7" if we were to assume the scores mentioned are the major and minor components, even though it's not explicitly stated.

Given these considerations, here's a structured JSON response. Since the sample type isn't explicitly clear and following the instructions to provide a response based on the most severe lesion (which is malignant in this case), and interpreting the data as closely as possible:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This response assumes that despite the lack of explicit sample type, the presence of malignancy is indicated by the discussion of Gleason scores, and the Gleason grade is interpreted from the scores mentioned (3 and 4), summing up to 7. 

However, it's worth noting that a more conservative or strict interpretation without making assumptions beyond the given text could result in:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This version reflects the uncertainty or lack of explicit information regarding the Gleason score sum.
