To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which suggests a more extensive sample than a typical biopsy. It doesn't explicitly state it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP), but the detailed inspection hints towards it. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another possibility but inspecting "all parts of the prostate" is more suggestive of RP. Still, without a clear indication, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support any of the options strongly, so we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue... forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages." This could imply malignancy since it talks about varying differentiation stages, which is a characteristic often assessed in cancer. However, it doesn't directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The mention of "Gleason scores" (score 4 and score 3) strongly suggests that there are malignant cells because Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that the fractions couldn't be reliably assessed due to the limited material investigated. Despite this, it implies that the Gleason score is relevant, suggesting malignancy. For structuring, we need "major+minor=sum." Typically, the Gleason score is reported as the sum of the two most prevalent patterns. If we consider score 4 and score 3 as the major and minor grades (without specifying which is more prevalent), a common interpretation might be "3+4=7" or "4+3=7." Without clear prevalence, we can't definitively choose between "3+4=7" and "4+3=7." However, since we're dealing with a situation where we need to provide a structured answer and the statement implies a significant presence of both scores, we'll have to make an educated guess or directly use the information given. The most severe lesion isn't clearly differentiated here, but "4+3=7" might be considered more severe than "3+4=7" due to the higher grade being the major component.

Given these considerations, here's a structured JSON response:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This response is based on the available information and the need to make some inferences due to the ambiguity in the original statement. 

1. **originalSampleType** is "NA" because the statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type.
2. **malignantTumorFindings** is "yes" due to the mention of Gleason scores and varying differentiation stages.
3. **gleasonGrade** is reported as "4+3=7," assuming the higher grade (4) as the major component for the most severe lesion, which is a reasonable inference given the context.
