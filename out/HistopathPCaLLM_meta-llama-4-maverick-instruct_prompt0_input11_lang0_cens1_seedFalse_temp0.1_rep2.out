To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue" and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a significant amount of tissue was available for examination. It also mentions inspection of "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section." This level of detail is more typical of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP, as it implies a more extensive sampling of the prostate. However, the statement doesn't explicitly confirm it as RP, and the percentage of material investigated is relatively low. Despite this, based on the detail about inspecting various parts of the prostate, we can infer it's likely not a biopsy. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another possibility but typically involves chips of prostate tissue rather than the detailed anatomical sections mentioned. Given the information and the allowed values, the most plausible answer based on the context provided is "RP" due to the detailed anatomical description, though it's not a definitive identification.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue... forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and refers to "Gleason scores" (score 4 and score 3), which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings since Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that the fractions of these scores "could not be reliably assessed." Despite this, it implies that the tumor is malignant and has components that would be scored as Gleason 3 and 4. For the purpose of structuring the data, we will interpret this as indicating a Gleason score, even though it's not explicitly quantified. A common interpretation for a tumor with Gleason patterns 3 and 4 would be to report it as "3+4=7" if 3 is the primary pattern or "4+3=7" if 4 is primary. Without clear information on the primary pattern, the most conservative assumption leaning towards the more severe lesion (given that score 4 is mentioned first) might suggest "4+3=7." Thus, the Gleason grade could be reported as "4+3=7."

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers based on the analysis of the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
