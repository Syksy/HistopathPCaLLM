To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "the material is classified as benign." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade to report. The Gleason grade is used for malignant prostate tissue to describe the aggressiveness of the cancer. For benign statements, the Gleason grade is considered "NA".

Therefore, applying the above analysis to the required structured fields:

- Original Sample Type: "TURP"
- Malignant Tumor Findings: "no"
- Reported Gleason Grade: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, providing the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
