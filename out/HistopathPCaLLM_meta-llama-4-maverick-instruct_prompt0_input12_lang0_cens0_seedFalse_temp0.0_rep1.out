To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate" which is indicative of a specific type of sample. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves electrosection or resection of prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." Thus, there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the material is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade reported for malignant findings. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Now, let's structure the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no lesion is considered malignant).
