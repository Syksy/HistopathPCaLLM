To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "the material is classified as benign." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade to report. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, which is malignant. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no severity variation) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
