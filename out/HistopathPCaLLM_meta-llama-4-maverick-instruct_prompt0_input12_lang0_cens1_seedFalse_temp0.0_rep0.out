To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. It doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.), but given that it's prostate cancer tissue and the mention of being started in "eight batches," it suggests a significant sample size, which could be indicative of a radical prostatectomy (RP) or possibly a TURP. However, without explicit information, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type as "biopsy" due to the mention of "eight batches," which might imply a larger sample. Since it's not explicitly stated and could be either RP or TURP based on the context of "eight batches," and without further details, the safest choice based on the given information would be "NA" due to the lack of direct evidence.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is affirmative, so the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. It mentions that the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate and that high-resolution images are in the digipathology queue, suggesting that a detailed examination is pending or was not available at the time of the statement. Since the Gleason grade is not mentioned, and given that the statement is about prostate cancer tissue, we should ideally look for a Gleason score. However, it's not provided, so we have to mark it as "NA" due to the absence of this specific information.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is malignant as it's prostate cancer tissue) and without nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements and provides the structured data as requested.
