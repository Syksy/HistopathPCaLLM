To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). It refers to the sample being processed in "eight batches," which could imply a substantial sample, but doesn't give a clear indication of the sample type. Without explicit information, we have to consider it as "NA" (Not Available/Not Specified).

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for grading prostate cancer based on its aggressiveness. Since there's no mention of the Gleason score or its components (major and minor grades), we should consider it as "NA" for the purpose of this structuring task.

Now, let's structure the information according to the given requirements in valid JSON format. We only need to consider the most severe lesion, but since the statement doesn't provide comparative information on different lesions, we'll proceed with the information available.

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements. 

- `sampleType` is "NA" because the sample type isn't specified.
- `malignantFindings` is "yes" since the statement confirms the presence of prostate cancer tissue.
- `gleasonGrade` is "NA" as there's no information provided about the Gleason grade.
