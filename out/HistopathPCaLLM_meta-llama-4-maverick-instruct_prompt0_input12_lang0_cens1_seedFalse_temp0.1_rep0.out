To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). It refers to the sample being processed in "eight batches," which could imply a substantial sample, but doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Without explicit information, we should consider it as "NA" (Not Available) because we cannot accurately determine the sample type from the given information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. It mentions that "majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate" and that high-resolution images are in the "digipathology queue," suggesting that a detailed examination is pending or was not available at the time of the statement. Since there's no mention of the Gleason grade, and given that the presence of cancer is confirmed, we should consider this as "NA" because the specific Gleason grade is not provided.

Now, let's structure the information according to the required format in JSON:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which is prostate cancer in this case), and is presented in a valid JSON format without nested structures.
