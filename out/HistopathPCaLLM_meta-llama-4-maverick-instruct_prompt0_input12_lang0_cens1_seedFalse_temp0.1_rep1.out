To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). It refers to the sample being processed in "eight batches," which could imply a substantial sample, but doesn't directly indicate the type. Without explicit information, we can't conclusively determine the sample type from the given text. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. It mentions that "majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate" and that high-resolution images are pending, but it doesn't discuss the Gleason score. Therefore, since the statement doesn't provide the Gleason grade and is related to a malignant finding, we still need to output "NA" for the Gleason grade as it's not available.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't provide comparative data, it directly mentions cancer tissue) and without nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the information available in the statement.
