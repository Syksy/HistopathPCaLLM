To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). It refers to the "obtained sample" and mentions it has been "started in eight batches," which could imply a significant amount of tissue was obtained, but doesn't specify the procedure type. Without explicit information, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given text. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. It mentions that the "majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate" and that high-resolution images are in the "digipathology queue," suggesting that a detailed examination is pending or not yet completed. Since there's no mention of the Gleason grade, the answer should be "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is implied to be malignant but without specific grading), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the severity and information available in the statement.
