To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In sample B carcinoma is observed," which means there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason score 5" and "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The most relevant information here for the Gleason grade is "4+5=9," which is in the required format of "major+minor=sum."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "biopsy."
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes."
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9."
