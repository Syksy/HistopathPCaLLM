To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In sample B carcinoma is observed," which means there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides a Gleason score, mentioning "Gleason score 5" and "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The Gleason grade is typically reported as the sum of the two most prevalent patterns (Gleason score) in the form of "major+minor=sum." Here, it is "4+5=9."

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in valid JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three questions based on the provided histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
