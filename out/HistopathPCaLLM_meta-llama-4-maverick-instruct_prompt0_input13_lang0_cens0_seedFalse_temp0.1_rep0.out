To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In sample B carcinoma is observed," which means there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides a Gleason score, mentioning "Gleason score 5" and "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The Gleason grade is typically reported as the sum of the two most prevalent patterns (Gleason score) in the form of "major+minor=sum." Here, it is given as "4+5=9," which fits the required format.

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format should be based on the most severe lesion, which in this case is described with a Gleason score of 9 (4+5).

Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three questions with the required information extracted from the histopathological statement.
