To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In sample B carcinoma is observed," meaning there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason score 5" and "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The Gleason grade is typically represented as the sum of the major and minor scores. Here, it's given as "4+5=9," which fits the required format.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three questions with the required information extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned.
