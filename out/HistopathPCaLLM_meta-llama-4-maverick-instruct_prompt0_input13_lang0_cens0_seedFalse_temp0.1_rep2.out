To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In sample B carcinoma is observed," which means there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason score 5" and "the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The Gleason grade is typically reported as the sum of the two most prevalent patterns (Gleason score) in the form of "major+minor=sum." Here, it is "4+5=9."

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in valid JSON format should be based on the most severe lesion, which in this case is the carcinoma observed in sample B.

Here is the structured data:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "biopsy."
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes."
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9."
