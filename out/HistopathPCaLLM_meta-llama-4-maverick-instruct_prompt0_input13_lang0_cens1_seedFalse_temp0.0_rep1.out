To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" being taken from "typical locations in the prostate" and mentions specific samples (e.g., "sample B"). The context suggests these are biopsy samples because it discusses taking samples from the prostate and examining them. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "some irregularities are observed" in "sample B" and that these "differentiation patterns... warrant further inspection by a colleague" and "further verification is needed via consultation." This suggests that while there are suspicious findings, they are not definitively diagnosed as malignant. However, the presence of "irregularities" and the need for "further inspection" imply a potential concern for malignancy, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. Thus, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned. The statement discusses "differentiation patterns" that are suspicious and require further inspection, but it does not provide a Gleason score. The Gleason score is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer diagnoses. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide a Gleason score, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" for the purpose of this structuring task.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is the suspicious "sample B") and adhering to the specified format, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind the chosen values:
- **sample_type**: "biopsy" because the context implies samples were taken for examination.
- **malignant_findings**: "NA" because while there are suspicious findings, the statement does not confirm malignancy.
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score is provided.

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given text.
