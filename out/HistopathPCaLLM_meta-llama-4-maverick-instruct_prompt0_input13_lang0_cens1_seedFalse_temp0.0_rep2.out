To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" being taken from "typical locations in the prostate" and mentions specific samples (e.g., "sample B"). The context suggests these are biopsy samples because it discusses taking samples from the prostate and examining them. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "some irregularities are observed" in sample B, and it mentions "suspicious pattern" that "warrants further inspection" and "further verification is needed via consultation." However, it does not explicitly state that the findings are malignant. The language used suggests a strong suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings without the confirmation that is pending further consultation. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the statement does not confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement discusses "differentiation patterns" that are suspicious and warrant further inspection, but it does not provide a Gleason score. Since there's no explicit mention of a Gleason grade and the diagnosis is not confirmed as malignant, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data based on the given text, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the text does not explicitly compare multiple lesions, sample B is highlighted as having irregularities). The answers are based on the information available in the statement.
