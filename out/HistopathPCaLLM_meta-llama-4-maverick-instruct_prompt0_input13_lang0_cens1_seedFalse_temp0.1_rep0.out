To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" being taken from "typical locations in the prostate" and mentions specific samples (e.g., "sample B"). The context suggests these are biopsy samples because it talks about taking samples from different locations within the prostate. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "some irregularities are observed" in sample B, and it mentions "suspicious pattern" that "warrants further inspection" and "further verification is needed via consultation." However, it does not explicitly state that the findings are malignant. The language used suggests a strong suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, while it's not a clear "yes," it's not a definitive "no" either. Given the uncertainty and the lack of a clear statement about malignancy, the answer could lean towards "NA" due to the absence of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection" but does not give a specific Gleason score. Since there's no explicit Gleason grading provided and the diagnosis is not confirmed, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is sample B due to the observed irregularities), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information provided in the statement.
