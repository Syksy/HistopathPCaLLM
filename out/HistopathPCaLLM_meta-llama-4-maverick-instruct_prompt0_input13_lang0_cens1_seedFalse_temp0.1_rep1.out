To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" being taken from "typical locations in the prostate" and mentions specific samples (e.g., "sample B"). The context suggests these are biopsy samples because it discusses taking samples from the prostate and examining them. Thus, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "some irregularities are observed" in sample B, which "warrant further inspection" and are described as a "suspicious pattern." However, it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings; instead, it suggests that "further verification is needed via consultation." This implies that while there are suspicions, there isn't a definitive diagnosis of malignancy provided in the statement. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. The statement is leaning towards a potential malignancy but hasn't confirmed it.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement discusses "differentiation patterns" that are suspicious and warrant further inspection, but it does not provide a Gleason score. The Gleason score is typically reported for malignant or suspicious findings that have been graded. Since there's no clear indication of a confirmed malignancy or a specific grade, and no Gleason score is mentioned, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" for the purpose of this structuring task.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which is sample B in this context) and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind the chosen values:
- **originalSampleType**: "biopsy" because the context implies samples were taken for examination.
- **malignantTumorFindings**: "NA" because while there are suspicious findings, there's no definitive diagnosis provided.
- **gleasonGrade**: "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score is provided.
