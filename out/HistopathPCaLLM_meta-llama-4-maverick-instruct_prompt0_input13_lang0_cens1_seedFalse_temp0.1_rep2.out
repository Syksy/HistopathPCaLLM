To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "sample B" and mentions that the material is from "the left side" and "the right side," indicating multiple samples. The context suggests these are biopsy samples because it discusses examining material from different locations within the prostate. Thus, we can infer the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "some irregularities are observed" in sample B and mentions "suspicious pattern" that "warrants further inspection" and "further verification is needed via consultation." However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The language used suggests a possibility but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings; it remains uncertain.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The text discusses "differentiation patterns" that are "suspicious" and require further inspection, but it does not provide a Gleason score. The Gleason score is a specific measure used for prostate cancer grading, and its absence, combined with the lack of a definitive malignancy diagnosis, means we cannot provide a Gleason grade.

Given these observations:

- For the sample type, we'll choose "biopsy" as it's the most plausible based on the context.
- For malignant tumor findings, the statement is uncertain and leans towards suspicion rather than confirmation. Thus, we cannot definitively say "yes." It is not a clear "no" either because of the suspicious findings. However, since we need to choose from "yes," "no," or "NA," and given that there's no clear confirmation, the closest answer would be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement on malignancy.
- For the Gleason grade, since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, we'll mark it as "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the required format and provides the structured data based on the given text.
