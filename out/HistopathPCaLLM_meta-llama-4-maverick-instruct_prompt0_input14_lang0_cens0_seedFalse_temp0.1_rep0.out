To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "a prostatetectomy preparate." Prostatetectomy is commonly referred to as Radical Prostatectomy (RP) in medical terminology. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "some tumorous growth is observed peripherally" and mentions "the found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement specifies "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." This implies the Gleason score is composed of a major grade of 3 and a minor grade of 4, summing up to 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "3+4=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and avoiding nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".
