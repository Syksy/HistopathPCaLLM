To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the specimen consists of prostate tissue prepared to be run on cassettes following the normal routine, and it refers to samples (e.g., samples D-G, K-P, O-Q). It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions "prostate tissue" and the inability to assess "prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status," which might imply a more extensive sampling than a simple biopsy, but it doesn't directly indicate a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). The lack of explicit information about the sample type and the context suggesting a detailed examination without clear indication of RP or TURP makes "biopsy" a plausible guess, but it's not definitive. Therefore, given the information and the allowed values, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further histopathological investigation to rule out "mid-grade GG findings." It implies that there are some suspicious findings but does not directly confirm malignancy. The comparison to a "recent Gleason 7 score patient" suggests that malignancy is a consideration, but the statement does not explicitly state that malignant tumor findings were present. Therefore, the answer could be considered as "NA" because it is not directly stated, or potentially "yes" if we infer that the "special patterns of cell growth" and discussion around Gleason grade imply malignancy. However, the most cautious interpretation based on the text is "NA" because it doesn't directly confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not directly report a Gleason grade for the specimen in question. It mentions a comparison to a "different, recent Gleason 7 score patient," suggesting that the current case is under consideration for a similar or potentially different Gleason score, but it does not provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the answer is "NA" because there is no reported Gleason grade for the specimen being discussed.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values. It represents the most severe lesion's characteristics implicitly by dealing with the information given about the specimen as a whole.
