To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the specimen consists of prostate tissue prepared to be run on cassettes following the normal routine, with specific samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q) being mentioned. It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies a detailed examination of tissue, which is more aligned with a biopsy. However, the text does not explicitly state it is a biopsy, and phrases like "roughly the prostate capsule border region" and the discussion about "prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status" suggest a more extensive surgical specimen, potentially from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). The lack of explicit mention and the context, however, makes it somewhat ambiguous. Given the information and the allowed values, the most likely interpretation leans towards "biopsy" due to the absence of clear indicators for RP or TURP, but it's not definitive.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and implies that there's a suspicion or indication of potentially malignant or significant histological findings, as it mentions the need for further histopathological investigation and comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The text suggests that there are concerning histological traits but does not explicitly state that malignant tumor findings were identified. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not definitively confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not directly report a Gleason grade for the specimen in question. It mentions a comparison to a different patient with a Gleason 7 score but does not provide a Gleason score for the case being discussed. The Gleason grade is not explicitly stated, suggesting that either it was not determined or not reported in the given statement.

Based on the analysis:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, the most appropriate answer seems to be "NA" due to the lack of clear indication, though one might argue it could be a "biopsy".
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, the answer is not a clear "yes" since the statement does not definitively confirm malignancy; it suggests further investigation is needed. Thus, it could be considered "NA" or potentially "no" if we interpret the lack of a definitive statement as implying benignity or uncertainty. However, given the context, "NA" seems more appropriate due to the ambiguity.
- For the **Reported Gleason Grade**, the answer is "NA" since no Gleason score is provided or confirmed for the specimen.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement does not clearly indicate multiple lesions or their severity), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" when the information is not available or not definitive.
