To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the specimen consists of prostate tissue prepared to be run on cassettes following the normal routine, and it refers to samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), indicating it's a tissue sample. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it mentions "prostate capsule border region" and "basis and seminal vehicle findings," which could imply a more extensive sampling possibly seen in a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a biopsy. However, the text does not conclusively indicate a TURP or clearly state it's a biopsy. The mention of assessing "prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status" strongly suggests a surgical specimen, which is most consistent with an RP. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and suggests further histopathological investigation to rule out "mid-grade GG findings." This implies suspicion or concern for malignancy but does not directly confirm malignant tumor findings. The text indicates that a definitive statement on malignancy is pending further investigation. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings based on the information given. The closest answer would be "NA" since the statement doesn't definitively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement references a comparison to a "recent Gleason 7 score patient" and mentions the need to "rule out mid-grade GG findings." This implies that a Gleason score has not been definitively assigned to the current patient's sample, but there's a context of potentially significant Gleason score. However, it does not directly report a Gleason grade for the specimen in question. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it is not directly reported for the sample being discussed.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's data (though in this case, the severity or presence of malignancy isn't confirmed).
- Returning data in valid JSON format without nested structures.
- Answering the three required structured fields based on the given statement.
