To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the specimen consists of prostate tissue prepared to be run on cassettes following the normal routine, and it refers to samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), indicating it's a tissue sample. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it mentions "prostate capsule border region" and "basis and seminal vehicle findings," suggesting it's likely related to a more significant surgical specimen rather than a simple biopsy. However, the text doesn't explicitly confirm if it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or another type. The mention of not being able to assess "prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status" hints it might not be a RP since such assessments are typical for RP specimens. Despite this, the lack of explicit mention of "biopsy" or "TURP" and the context provided leans more towards a significant specimen but doesn't conclusively determine the type. Therefore, based on the information given and the context clues, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and suggests further histopathological investigation to rule out "mid-grade GG findings." This implies a suspicion or concern for malignancy but doesn't confirm it. The text does not directly state that malignant tumor findings were present; instead, it indicates a need for further investigation. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. Therefore, the answer should be considered as "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a comparison to a "recent Gleason 7 score patient" and discusses the possibility of "mid-grade GG findings." However, it does not report a Gleason grade for the specimen in question. It suggests that a Gleason score might be relevant upon further investigation but doesn't provide one. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it is not directly reported for the specimen.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the information provided in the statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though none was explicitly diagnosed) and adhering to the required format.
