To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the specimen consists of prostate tissue prepared to be run on cassettes following the normal routine, with samples labeled (e.g., D-G, K-P, O-Q). It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions "prostate tissue" and the inability to assess "prostate capsule breach or positive/negative surgical margin status," which hints at it not being a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen since such assessments are typically done on RP specimens. The text also doesn't directly indicate it's a TURP. The detailed sampling and discussion around histological traits and potential Gleason grade suggest it's likely a biopsy. Therefore, the most reasonable inference based on the information given is that the sample type is a "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further histopathological investigation to rule out "mid-grade GG findings." This implies suspicion or uncertainty about malignancy rather than a definitive diagnosis of cancer. However, it does not explicitly state that there are malignant tumor findings. The discussion around Gleason score (a grading system used for prostate cancer) and the need to "rule out mid-grade GG findings" suggests there is some level of concern or suspicion for malignancy, but it is not conclusive. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively stated as "yes." Given the context, the answer leans towards "NA" because the statement does not conclusively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a comparison to a "recent Gleason 7 score patient" and discusses the need to investigate further to "rule out mid-grade GG findings." The Gleason score is mentioned (Gleason 7), but it's in the context of a different patient, not the one being discussed. There's no direct Gleason score given for the patient in question. Therefore, the Gleason grade for this patient's sample is "NA" because it's not provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides answers based on the information available in the statement.
