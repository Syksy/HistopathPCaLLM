To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings," which is indicative of a specific type of sample. "Prostate chippings" is associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
   - Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating malignant tumor findings.
   - Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that the Gleason score is derived from Gleason 4 being the most represented, leading to a sum of 8. It implies the Gleason score is 4+4=8.
   - Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+4=8".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+4=8".
