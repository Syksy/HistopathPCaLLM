To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings," which is indicative of a specific type of sample. "Prostate chippings" is associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is affirmative.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Typically, the Gleason score is represented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns (major and minor). The statement implies a Gleason score where one component is 4, and it results in a sum of 8. Therefore, if we assume the major is 4 and it's the most represented, and the sum is 8, the minor would be 4 as well, making the score "4+4=8".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+4=8".
