To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings," which is indicative of a specific type of sample. "Prostate chippings" is associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is affirmative.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is mentioned in the statement. It indicates that "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Typically, the Gleason score is represented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns. The statement implies a Gleason score where one of the grades is 4. Assuming the most common representation, if 4 is one of the grades and the sum is 8, the other grade would be 4 as well, making it "4+4=8."

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is "TURP" because the sample consists of prostate chippings.
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+4=8."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON output directly addresses the three required fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
