To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could be from any of these sources. The context suggests it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of "preliminary scopic inspection" and the uncertainty around the diagnosis, which is common in biopsy samples. However, the exact type isn't specified, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" (Not Available) due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings through histopathology. It indicates that the suspicion needs to be "either confirmed or discarded" in the next histologic examination. Thus, based on the histopathological examination reported, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed. Therefore, the answer should be "no" as it doesn't confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." It references a suspected Gleason sum based on clinical notes but not based on the histopathological examination. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" since it wasn't determined or reported for the sample examined.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by:
- Not nesting structures.
- Providing answers for the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity isn't confirmed).
- Using the allowed values for each field.
