To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could be from any of these sources. The context suggests it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of "preliminary scopic inspection" and the uncertainty around the Gleason grade, which is common in biopsy samples where the tissue might be limited. However, the exact type isn't specified, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings through histopathology. It indicates that the suspicion needs to be "either confirm or discard" in the next histologic examination. Thus, based on the histopathological examination reported, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed, so the answer should be "no" as it doesn't definitively state "yes" or provide a conclusive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." It references a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above based on clinical notes, but this is not a confirmed histopathological finding. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it wasn't determined or reported for the sample examined.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity isn't confirmed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
