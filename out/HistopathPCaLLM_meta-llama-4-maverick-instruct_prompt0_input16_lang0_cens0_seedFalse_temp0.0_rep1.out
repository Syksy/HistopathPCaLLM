To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates the presence of carcinoma, mentioning "approximately half contains carcinoma focuses." Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement describes the presence of Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 components. It mentions that the Gleason 4 component is less than one third of the carcinoma length, and the score is 7. It further clarifies that architecture 3 covers approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covers approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma part. This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Given the information, the structured data in valid JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "GleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three questions with the required information extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
