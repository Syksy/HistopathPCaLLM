To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates the presence of carcinoma, mentioning "approximately half contains carcinoma focuses." Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement describes the Gleason grade, mentioning "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4-type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third of the carcinoma length." It concludes with "finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Given the information, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the statement.
