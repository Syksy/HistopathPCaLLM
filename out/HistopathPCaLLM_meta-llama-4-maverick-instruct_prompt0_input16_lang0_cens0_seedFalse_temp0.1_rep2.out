To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**

The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**

The statement indicates the presence of carcinoma, mentioning "approximately half contains carcinoma focuses" and describing the Gleason grade. Thus, there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**

The statement describes the Gleason grade, mentioning "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4-type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third of the carcinoma length" and concludes with a "score 7" where "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
