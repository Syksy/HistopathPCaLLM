To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "the slides prior to digitalization," which implies that the original sample could be from a biopsy, given that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) might not typically be described in this manner, and the focus is on "suspicious foci." However, without explicit mention, we must infer based on context. The term "biopsy" is often associated with such descriptions. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "suspicious foci" and various "grades of cell differentiation," indicating that there are concerns about malignancy. It also discusses the difficulty in assessing the grade due to digitalization issues, implying that malignancy is suspected or identified. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement discusses the difficulty in assigning a Gleason score due to "resolution issues in the digitalized images" and mentions "mid-grade (i.e., 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation." This indicates that while a precise Gleason score couldn't be determined, the suspicion or presence of a score around these values is noted. For structuring, we need to identify the most severe lesion's Gleason grade. Between "3+4" and "4+3," the latter is considered more severe because it has a higher secondary grade. Thus, the most severe reported Gleason grade that can be inferred is "4+3=7."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the required fields based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion identified.
