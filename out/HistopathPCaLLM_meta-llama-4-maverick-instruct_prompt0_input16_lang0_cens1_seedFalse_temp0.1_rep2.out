To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "the slides prior to digitalization," which could imply a biopsy or another form of sampling. The terms "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are not directly mentioned. Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy" because it involves inspecting "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and mentions examining slides, which is common in biopsy procedures. However, without a clear indication, one might lean towards "NA" (Not Available) due to the lack of explicit information. For the purpose of this task and based on the context provided, we'll consider it as "biopsy" due to the mention of "suspicious foci" and the process of digitalization and slide examination.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "tissue that exhibits patterns" that were "closely inspected in digital histopathology" and mentions "various grades of cell differentiation are observed." This implies the presence of malignant cells since the discussion revolves around grading, which is a characteristic of cancer assessment. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement discusses observing "various grades of cell differentiation" but notes that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images." It specifically mentions that assessing "mid-grade (i.e., 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation would be very difficult to reliably assess." This indicates that while a Gleason score is relevant, it cannot be determined due to technical issues. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not explicitly reported, and we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a definitive score.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion implicitly by discussing the challenges in grading the observed malignant patterns.
