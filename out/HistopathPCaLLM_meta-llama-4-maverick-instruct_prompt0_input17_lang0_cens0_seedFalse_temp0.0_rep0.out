To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a specimen obtained after a surgical removal of the prostate gland. The term for this surgical procedure is "radical prostatectomy" (RP). Therefore, the original sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "Multiple clear foci" with a "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. The presence of a tumor with specific Gleason grades directly implies malignancy. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." The Gleason grading system is typically reported as a sum of the most prevalent and the highest grade found in the tumor. Here, it implies the Gleason score is "3+4=7" since grade 3 and grade 4 are mentioned, with grade 4 being the most dominant. However, the conventional reporting is to list the most prevalent grade first, followed by the highest grade. The statement does not explicitly state the proportion of each grade, but based on the information given (most dominant being grade 4), one might infer the score as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Given that grade 4 is described as "most dominant," it is reasonable to infer that the Gleason score should be reported as "4+3=7".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+3=7".
