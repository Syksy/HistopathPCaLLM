To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates the sample is from a prostatectomy. The abbreviation "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and mentions a "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as "3+4". However, it is common in pathology to report the Gleason score with the most prevalent pattern first, followed by the worst pattern. The sum is what's critical for the score. The statement suggests a sum of 7 (3+4), but it is phrased as having a dominant grade 4, suggesting a possible score of "4+3=7". Given the information, the most likely interpretation is that the Gleason score is "4+3=7" because it mentions grade 4 as the dominant pattern.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
