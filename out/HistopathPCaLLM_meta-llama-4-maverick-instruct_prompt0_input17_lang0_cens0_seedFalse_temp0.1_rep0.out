To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. The most common surgical procedure for prostatectomy is Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and mentions a "tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 4 (major) + 3 (minor) = 7 (sum). Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
