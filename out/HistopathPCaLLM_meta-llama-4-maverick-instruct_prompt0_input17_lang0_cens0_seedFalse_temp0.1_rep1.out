To solve this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample is from a prostatectomy. The abbreviation "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the original sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "Multiple clear foci" with "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and mentions "perineural invasion" and the tumor "infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." These are indicators of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it can be inferred that the major grade is 4 and the minor is 3, making the sum 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be structured as "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three required structured fields based on the provided histopathological statement.
