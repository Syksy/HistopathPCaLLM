To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**

The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a specimen obtained after a surgical removal of the prostate gland. The term for this surgical procedure is "radical prostatectomy" (RP). Therefore, the original sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**

The statement describes "Multiple clear foci" with "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," indicating the presence of malignant tumor cells since Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer. It also mentions "perineural invasion" and the tumor "infiltrating through the capsule to the fat," further confirming malignancy. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**

The statement provides the Gleason grades as "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." To structure this into the required "major+minor=sum" format, we need to understand that in the context of prostate cancer, the Gleason score is typically calculated by adding the grades of the two most prevalent patterns. The statement implies the major grade is 4 and the minor is 3. Therefore, the Gleason score would be calculated as 4+3=7.

Now, let's structure the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
