To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O." and refers to "prostate tissue sites." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the detailed description of the prostate tissue and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate, it suggests a significant sample. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves the removal of the entire prostate gland and is known for providing detailed information about the prostate's structure. The description does not directly indicate a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as those procedures are generally less comprehensive in terms of the tissue sampled. However, without explicit mention, we must infer based on context. The detailed spatial information (basis to apex, different parts labeled) is more suggestive of a larger specimen like RP rather than a biopsy or TURP. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This implies that there is a possibility of malignant findings since Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of cancer; it suggests that the assessment could determine if the material is "fully healthy" or not. The fact that Gleason scores are being considered implies that there is a suspicion or possibility of cancer, but the statement does not definitively state that malignant tumor findings were present. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings based on the information given. The statement is more about the potential for assessment rather than a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score. It implies that the assessment might determine the presence and grade of cancer but does not report a Gleason grade. Therefore, we cannot extract a specific Gleason grade from this statement.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though not directly identified) and adhering to the allowed values, would be as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

**Rationale**:
- **originalSampleType**: "RP" because the detailed description suggests a comprehensive sample like that from a Radical Prostatectomy.
- **malignantTumorFindings**: "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm or deny the presence of malignant tumor findings; it suggests a potential assessment.
- **gleasonGrade**: "NA" because no specific Gleason score is reported; the statement only discusses the possibility of assessing Gleason scores between 3 to 5.
