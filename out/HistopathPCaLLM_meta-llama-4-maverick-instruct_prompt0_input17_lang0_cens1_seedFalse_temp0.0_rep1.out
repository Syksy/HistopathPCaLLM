To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O." and refers to "prostate tissue sites." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the detailed description of the prostate tissue and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate, it suggests a significant sample. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is a plausible sample type given the detailed anatomical description. However, without explicit mention, one must infer based on context. The description is more aligned with a detailed examination possible in an RP or a thorough biopsy. Yet, the detailed spatial information (basis to apex, specific sample labeling) is more typical of a radical prostatectomy specimen. Thus, we'll consider "RP" as a potential sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This implies that there is a possibility of malignant findings since Gleason scores are used for assessing prostate cancer. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy; it suggests an evaluation is pending or to be done. The text does not explicitly state that malignant tumor findings are present; it leaves the assessment open.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" but does not provide a specific Gleason score. It implies that a Gleason score could be determined if malignancy is present but does not report a score.

Given these observations:

- The sample type is not explicitly stated but could be inferred as "RP" based on the detailed description.
- The presence of malignant findings is not confirmed; it's speculative based on the mention of Gleason scores.
- The Gleason grade is not reported.

Thus, based on the information and the instructions:

1. **Original Sample Type**: Since it's not explicitly mentioned, a safe choice could be "NA" (Not Available), but based on the detailed spatial description, one might lean towards "RP". However, sticking strictly to the information given, "NA" is more appropriate.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement does not confirm malignancy; hence, "NA" is the most appropriate response.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since no specific Gleason score is provided, "NA" is the correct response.

The structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though not explicitly identified) and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the allowed values and the requirement to not have nested structures, providing a straightforward answer based on the information given in the statement.
