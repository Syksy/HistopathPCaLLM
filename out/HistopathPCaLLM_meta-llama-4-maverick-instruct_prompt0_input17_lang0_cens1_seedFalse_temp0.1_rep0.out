To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O." and refers to "prostate tissue sites." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the detailed description of the prostate tissue and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate, it suggests a significant sample. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is a plausible sample type given the detailed anatomical description. However, without explicit mention, one might lean towards "NA" due to lack of direct information. Yet, the detailed description leans more towards a substantial specimen like RP rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement hints at the possibility of assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" which implies that there could be malignant findings since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings; it merely suggests that if present, the differentiation stages can be assessed. The phrase "or if the material is fully healthy" also leaves open the possibility that the tissue might be benign. Thus, without a clear statement on malignancy, one might be inclined towards "NA". However, the context implies an anticipation of potentially malignant findings, so a cautious "yes" could be considered if we interpret the statement as implying potential malignancy is being considered.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present," indicating that there is a consideration for Gleason scoring, which is used for prostate cancer grading. However, it does not provide a specific Gleason score. The Gleason score is typically reported as "major+minor=sum". Since a specific score is not given, and the statement is not confirming malignancy, the most appropriate answer would be "NA".

Given these considerations:

- **Original Sample Type**: The detailed description suggests a substantial specimen, likely "RP".
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The context implies potential malignancy is being considered, but it's not a clear "yes". The presence of malignancy is not confirmed.
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "NA" because a specific Gleason score is not provided.

Thus, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though not explicitly identified here) and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the information given and the constraints of the allowed values. The actual values chosen reflect a balance between the information directly available in the statement and the need to adhere to the specified format and allowed values.
