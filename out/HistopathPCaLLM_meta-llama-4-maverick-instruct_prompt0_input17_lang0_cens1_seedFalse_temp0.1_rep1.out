To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O." and refers to "prostate tissue sites." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the detailed description of the prostate tissue and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate, it suggests a significant sample. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is a plausible sample type given the detailed anatomical description. However, without explicit mention, one might lean towards "NA" due to lack of clear indication. Yet, the detailed description leans more towards a substantial specimen like RP rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This implies that there is a possibility of malignant findings since Gleason scores are used for assessing prostate cancer. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings; it suggests an evaluation is pending or to be done.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement hints at the possibility of Gleason scores between 3 to 5 but does not provide a definitive Gleason score. It implies that an assessment for Gleason grading is needed or pending.

Given these observations:

- For the **original sample type**, the most likely answer is "RP" due to the detailed anatomical description of the prostate, though it's not explicitly stated.
- For **malignant tumor findings**, the statement does not confirm the presence of malignant findings; it suggests an evaluation is needed. Hence, it leans towards "NA" because it doesn't directly state "yes" or "no."
- For the **reported Gleason grade**, since there's no definitive Gleason score provided and the statement is more about the potential need for assessment, the answer would be "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though not directly identified) and avoiding nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a JSON output with the required fields and values based on the analysis of the given statement.
