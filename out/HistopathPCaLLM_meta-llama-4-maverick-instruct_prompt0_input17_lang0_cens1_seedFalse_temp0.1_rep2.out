To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O." and refers to "prostate tissue sites." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the detailed description of the prostate tissue and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate, it suggests a significant surgical specimen. However, it doesn't explicitly mention whether it's a biopsy, Radical Prostatectomy (RP), or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). The detailed spatial description might lean more towards an RP, but without explicit mention, we must be cautious. Thus, we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of direct information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This implies that there is a possibility of malignant findings since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer grading. However, it does not confirm the presence of malignancy; it suggests that the assessment is pending or will be determined. The text does not directly state that there are malignant tumor findings; it leaves it as a possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. The correct interpretation might be "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score for a malignant finding. It indicates that the assessment of Gleason grade is part of the evaluation that will be done, implying that a specific score has not been determined yet. Therefore, we should consider this as "NA" because a specific Gleason grade (in the form of "major+minor=sum") is not reported.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the presence of a lesion is not confirmed). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
