To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through 12 tissue blocks. The term "chippings" and the context suggest a procedure that is not a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a simple biopsy. The mention of "standard shaving procedure" is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), which involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, there are malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason sum is given as 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is made up of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 is the larger fraction and the sum is 7). Therefore, the Gleason score can be inferred as 3+4=7.

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in valid JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's how the answers were derived:
- **sampleType**: "TURP" because the procedure described matches the characteristics of a TURP.
- **malignantFindings**: "yes" because carcinoma is identified in the chippings.
- **gleasonGrade**: "3+4=7" because the Gleason sum is 7, with the primary grade being 3 and the secondary grade being 4.

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
