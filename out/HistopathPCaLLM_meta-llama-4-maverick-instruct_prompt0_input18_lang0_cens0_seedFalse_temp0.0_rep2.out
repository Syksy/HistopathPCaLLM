To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are "processed through 12 tissue blocks." This context suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) since it involves chippings and a shaving procedure, which is typical for TURP.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma," which directly implies the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason sum is mentioned as 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is made up of 3 (major) and 4 (minor) since 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be reported as "3+4=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".
