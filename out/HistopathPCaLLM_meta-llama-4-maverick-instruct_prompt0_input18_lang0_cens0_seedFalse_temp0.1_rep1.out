To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are "processed through 12 tissue blocks." This context suggests a procedure that involves removing tissue, and given that it's related to prostate cancer, it is likely referring to a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as this involves removing chippings of prostate tissue.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, there were malignant tumor findings.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason sum is given as 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is made up of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7). The statement directly provides the Gleason sum and implies the major and minor grades.

Given the information:
- The sample type is "TURP" because the description matches the procedure.
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" because carcinoma is identified.
- The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7" since the major grade is 3 and the sum is 7, implying the minor grade is 4.

Thus, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required.
