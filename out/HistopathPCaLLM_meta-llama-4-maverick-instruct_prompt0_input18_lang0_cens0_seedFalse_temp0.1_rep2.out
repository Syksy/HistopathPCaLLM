To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are "processed through 12 tissue blocks." This context suggests a procedure that involves removing tissue, typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is known for involving chippings or shavings of prostate tissue.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, there are malignant tumor findings.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason sum is given as 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is made up of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7). The statement directly provides the sum (7) and indicates the major grade is 3. Thus, we can infer the minor grade is 4 because 3 is the major and it sums up to 7.

Given these observations:

- The sample type is "TURP" because the procedure involves chippings obtained through a shaving procedure, typical of TURP.
- Malignant tumor findings are "yes" since carcinoma is identified.
- The Gleason grade can be represented as "3+4=7" since the major grade is 3, and the sum is 7, implying the minor grade is 4.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement.
