To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the "Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches." It does not explicitly state the type of procedure (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given that it's processed in multiple tissue batches and there's a mention of inspecting a small fraction that might require further investigation, it suggests a procedure that yields multiple tissue samples. All three procedures (biopsy, RP, TURP) could potentially result in multiple tissue samples. However, the lack of specific information pointing towards RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) and the fact that it's not explicitly mentioned, along with the context of inspecting multiple tissue batches for cancer, makes "biopsy" a plausible guess. Still, without explicit information, the most accurate answer based on the given data would be "NA" due to the absence of a clear indication.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction would require further inspection" because it "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above." ISUP GG (International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group) 1 or above implies the presence or suspicion of cancer. Thus, there are malignant tumor findings suspected, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group." This implies that while there's a suspicion of cancer (as indicated by the possibility of it being ISUP GG 1 or above), the Gleason grade or Grade Group cannot be determined due to the small size of the suspicious area. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not reported or is "NA" because it couldn't be accurately assigned.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
