To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of "adenocarcinoma" is mentioned in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a detailed Gleason score for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4, breaking down the percentages of Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 components.

Now, let's extract the required information:

- **Original Sample Type**: The statement clearly indicates that the samples are "targeted prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: Since adenocarcinoma is identified in one of the samples, the answer is "yes."

- **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason score is given as Gleason 3 (approx 90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). Thus, the major grade is 3, the minor grade is 4, and the sum is 7. So, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7."

Given that we are only to return the results from the most severe lesion and the structured result should not consist of nested structures, we will provide the information in valid JSON format as requested.

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy."
2. There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."
3. The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."
