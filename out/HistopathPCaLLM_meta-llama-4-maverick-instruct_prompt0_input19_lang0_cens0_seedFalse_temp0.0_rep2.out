To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of "adenocarcinoma" is mentioned in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grade for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4, with Gleason 3 making up about 90% and Gleason 4 making up about 10%. The Gleason score is calculated by adding the major and minor grades.

Let's extract the required information:

- **Original Sample Type**: The statement clearly indicates that the samples are "biopsies."
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: Since adenocarcinoma is mentioned, the answer is "yes."
- **Gleason Grade**: The major grade is 3 (making up 90%), and the minor grade is 4 (making up 10%), so the Gleason score is 3+4=7.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy."
2. There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."
3. The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7."
