To solve this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of "adenocarcinoma" is mentioned in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: For sample 4, which contains adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is described. The major component is Gleason 3 (approximately 90%), and the minor component is Gleason 4 (approximately 10%). Thus, the Gleason score is calculated as 3+4=7.

Now, let's structure the information according to the given requirements:

- **Original Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "yes"
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "3+4=7"

Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case, as it contains adenocarcinoma) and providing the information in a non-nested structure.
