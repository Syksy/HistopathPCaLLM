To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of "adenocarcinoma" is mentioned in sample 4, indicating malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: For sample 4, which contains adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grades are provided as Gleason 3 (approximately 90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The Gleason score is calculated by adding the major and minor grades. Here, it seems Gleason 3 is the major grade (since it's approximately 90%), and Gleason 4 is the minor grade. Thus, the Gleason score is 3+4=7.

Given these observations, let's structure the data:

- **Original Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "yes"
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "3+4=7"

In valid JSON format, the structured answer is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case).
