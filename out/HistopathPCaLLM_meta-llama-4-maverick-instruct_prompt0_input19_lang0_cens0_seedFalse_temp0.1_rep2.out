To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values: "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that "sample 4... contains adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - For sample 4, which contains adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is given as "Gleason 3" for approximately 90% of the sample and "Gleason 4" for 10% of the sample. The Gleason score is calculated by adding the major and minor grades. Here, Gleason 3 is the major grade (since it constitutes the larger portion), and Gleason 4 is the minor grade. Thus, the Gleason score is "3+4=7."

Given that sample 4 is the most severe lesion mentioned and it contains adenocarcinoma with a Gleason score of "3+4=7," we can now structure the data into the required JSON format.

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case).
