To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples as being processed "as per routine for the specific sample type" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which is suggestive of a biopsy. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" due to concerns about potential mixing with non-prostate tissue or a lab mishap. The uncertainty and the need for further verification imply that there is a suspicion of malignancy but it's not confirmed. Sample 1 is unrepresentative. Since sample 4 is the most severe lesion mentioned and there's a possibility it's malignant, we should consider this when determining the presence of malignant tumor findings. However, the statement does not confirm malignancy; hence, the answer should reflect the uncertainty or the lack of confirmation. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Given that there's a suspicion but no confirmation, the closest answer would be "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Sample 4 is noted for having cell architectures that "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and is "possibly malignant," but there's no Gleason grade mentioned. Since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade provided, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
