To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples as "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length" in the context of sample 4, which suggests that the samples are likely biopsies because they are described in terms of cylinders, a common description for biopsy samples. Therefore, the most likely original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue", and sample 1 is "unrepresentative of the prostate". For sample 4, it's mentioned that cell architectures "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and it's "possibly malignant", but it's also stated that it's uncertain whether the tissue is truly abnormal or mixed with non-prostate tissue. Despite the uncertainty, the presence of a possibility of malignancy in sample 4 makes it the most severe lesion in terms of potential malignancy. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is not a definitive "yes" due to the uncertainty, but it's not "no" either. Given the allowed values, the closest interpretation would be "yes" because it is the most severe lesion and has a possibility of being malignant.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Sample 4 is considered "possibly malignant" but without a definitive diagnosis of malignancy or a Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy with a reported Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the provided histopathological statement.
