To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples as being processed "as per routine for the specific sample type" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which is suggestive of a biopsy. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" due to concerns about potential contamination or a lab mishap. Despite the uncertainty, the mention of "possibly malignant" suggests that there is a suspicion of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively "yes." However, given the context, the answer is not a clear "no" either because of the uncertainty and the possibility of malignancy. The most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" due to the uncertainty and the fact that further verification is needed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Sample 4 is noted for having cell architectures that "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and is "possibly malignant," but no Gleason grade is mentioned. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy and no Gleason grade provided, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data as requested.
