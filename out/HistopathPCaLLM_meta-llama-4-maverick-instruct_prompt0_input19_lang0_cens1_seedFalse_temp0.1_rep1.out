To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples as being processed "as per routine for the specific sample type" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which is suggestive of a biopsy. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" due to concerns about potential contamination or a lab mishap. Despite the uncertainty, the mention of "possibly malignant" suggests that there is a suspicion of malignancy, but it's not confirmed. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively "yes." However, given the context, the answer is not a clear "no" either because of the suspicion around sample 4. The most appropriate response, given the allowed values, leans towards "yes" due to the suspicion of malignancy in sample 4, which is the most severe lesion mentioned.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Sample 4 is noted as "possibly malignant" but without a definitive diagnosis of malignancy or a Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it is not reported.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the most severe lesion (sample 4), which is considered "possibly malignant," hence justifying "yes" for malignant tumor findings, and "NA" for Gleason grade due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis or grading.
