To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples as being processed "as per routine for the specific sample type" and mentions "samples" and "cylinder's length," which is more indicative of a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it's uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" or if there's been a lab mishap. Sample 1 is unrepresentative. The presence of malignancy is uncertain for the most suspicious sample (sample 4), but it's not definitively stated as malignant. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported. Thus, the Gleason grade should be "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields. The values are chosen based on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case), and the allowed values are respected.
