To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Now, let's structure these answers into a valid JSON format. The required fields are "sampleType", "malignantFindings", and "gleasonGrade".

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no variation in severity).
