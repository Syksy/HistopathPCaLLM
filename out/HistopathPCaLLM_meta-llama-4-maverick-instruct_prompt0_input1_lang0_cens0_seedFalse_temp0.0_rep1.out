To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "biopsy."
- There were no malignant tumor findings ("no").
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample was benign.

The response is structured as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there were no malignant findings, so the concept of "most severe" doesn't apply). The output is in a flat JSON structure without any nested structures.
