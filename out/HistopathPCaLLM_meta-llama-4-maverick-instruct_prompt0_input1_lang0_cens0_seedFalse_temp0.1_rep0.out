To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Now, let's structure these findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there were no malignant findings, so the concept of "most severe" doesn't apply in terms of malignancy). The answers are provided in a flat structure without nesting, adhering to the specified requirements.
