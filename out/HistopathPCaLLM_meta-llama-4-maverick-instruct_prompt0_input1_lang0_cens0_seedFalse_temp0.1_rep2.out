To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there were no malignant findings to assess severity).
