To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not mentioned. The statement refers to "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations," which could imply a biopsy, but it's not conclusive. Given the lack of explicit information, the safest choice is "NA".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions inspecting "epithelial cell characteristics" and the possibility of "malignancy," indicating that the inspection is related to cancer. However, it concludes that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. Since it's not a definitive "yes" or "no" due to the inconclusive nature, and given the context that it's related to prostate cancer samples, we should consider it as leaning towards potentially being malignant but not confirmed. The closest allowed value in this context, given the uncertainty, is "NA" because it's not a clear "yes" or "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" and that there's a need for "additional inspection regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a Gleason grade was not conclusively reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not definitively provided.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions, the overall conclusion is applied), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the given statement.
