To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not mentioned. The statement refers to "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations," which could imply a biopsy, but it's not conclusive. Given the lack of explicit information, the most appropriate answer is "NA".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples" but also indicates that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. This suggests that while there is an expectation or suspicion of malignancy due to the samples being labeled as "prostate cancer samples," the actual determination of malignancy is not conclusive. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignant tumor findings. The most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a reliable Gleason grade was not provided or determined. Hence, the answer should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the information about the severity or multiple lesions is not conclusively provided).
