To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations," which could imply a biopsy since it mentions "standard locations," a term often used in the context of biopsy protocols. There's no clear indication that it's from a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. This suggests that it's not definitively stated whether there are malignant tumor findings or not. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is not a clear "yes" or "no," so it should be considered as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a definitive Gleason grade was not provided or was not possible due to the quality of the sample or technical issues. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not conclusively reported.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the findings were inconclusive).
