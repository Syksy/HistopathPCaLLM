To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to deduce or directly infer from the given text. Since it mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected," without specifying the type, and given that it's not explicitly mentioned, we should consider it as "NA" because we cannot accurately determine the sample type from the information provided.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the final results appear inconclusive regarding malignancy. It mentions that "Mostly normal cell architectures are observed" but also that there are concerns regarding malignancy. However, it does not conclusively state the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a conclusive Gleason grade was not provided or determined. Hence, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because the statement does not provide a specific Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the information about malignancy and Gleason grade is inconclusive).
