To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to deduce or directly infer from the given text. Since it mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected," without specifying the type, and given the context doesn't directly imply RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), the most likely sample type is a "biopsy" as it's common for initial assessments. However, the text does not directly state this, so we should consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the inspection is for prostate cancer samples and mentions inspecting epithelial cell characteristics, suggesting a search for malignancy. However, it concludes that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. Thus, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a conclusive Gleason grade was not provided. Hence, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as the statement does not provide a specific grade.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the findings were inconclusive).
