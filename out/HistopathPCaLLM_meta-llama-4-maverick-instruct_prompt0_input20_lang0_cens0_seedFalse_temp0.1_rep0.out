To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of malignant tumor. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides Gleason grades for different parts of the sample. For the apex, it's "3+4" and for the basis, it's "4+4". Since "4+4" is more severe than "3+4", we consider "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three questions with the required information extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
