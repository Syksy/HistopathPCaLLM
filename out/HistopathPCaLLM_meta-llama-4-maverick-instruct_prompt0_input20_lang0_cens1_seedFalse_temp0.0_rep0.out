To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." It indicates that tissue samples were taken, but it doesn't directly state the method. However, the detailed division of the prostate into regions (apex, middle, basis) and the mention of sampling suggests a significant tissue sampling, which is more indicative of a biopsy or a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is less likely as it typically doesn't involve such detailed regional sampling. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" or "RP" conclusively, but given the context, "biopsy" seems plausible because it mentions "samples." However, the most appropriate answer isn't directly derivable; hence, we might consider it as not directly stated or "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that due to previous treatments, the assessment for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) couldn't be conclusively made. However, it doesn't directly state that there are no malignant findings; rather, it suggests that the evaluation is complicated. The presence of cancer isn't confirmed or denied directly, so we might lean towards "NA" due to the inability to assess.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found," indicating that the actual Gleason score wasn't determined. It suggests that even if a Gleason score like 3+4 were present, the focus is elsewhere due to the patient's overall condition. Since the Gleason grade wasn't actually reported due to the tissue being "highly affected" by previous therapies, the answer should be "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly support identifying severity due to the lack of a clear cancer diagnosis), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the information available in the statement and adheres to the allowed values for each field.
