To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." It indicates that tissue samples were taken, but it doesn't directly state the method. However, the detailed division of the prostate into regions (apex, middle, basis) and the mention of sampling suggests a significant tissue sampling, which is more indicative of a biopsy or a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is less likely as it typically doesn't involve such detailed regional sampling. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" or "RP" conclusively, but given the context, it seems more aligned with a biopsy due to the mention of multiple samples from different regions without explicitly stating it's from a prostatectomy. However, the exact procedure isn't clearly stated, making it somewhat ambiguous.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that due to previous treatments, the assessment for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) couldn't be conclusively made. It doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings but suggests that the evaluation was compromised. Thus, we can't conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings due to the impact of previous therapies.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found," indicating that the actual Gleason grade wasn't determined due to the effects of previous treatments on the tissue. Thus, a specific Gleason grade wasn't reported.

Given these considerations:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, the most likely answer is "biopsy" due to the detailed sampling described, though it's not a definitive conclusion. However, it's the closest we can get with the given information.
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, since the examination for adenocarcinoma was impossible due to previous therapies, we should consider it as "NA" because we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignant findings.
- For the **Reported Gleason Grade**, since the Gleason grade wasn't determined and is only mentioned in a hypothetical context, the answer is "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" where appropriate.
