To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." It indicates that tissue samples were taken, but it doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are divided into sets from different regions of the prostate, it suggests a more extensive sampling which could be associated with a radical prostatectomy (RP) or biopsy. The statement doesn't directly support TURP as it typically refers to a specific procedure for relieving urinary obstruction. The detailed regional sampling (apex, middle, basis) could be more indicative of RP. However, the text does not explicitly state it was RP, and the complexity of the sampling could also be interpreted in the context of extensive biopsies. Still, "biopsy" seems a plausible interpretation given the context of sampling and the fact that RP is not directly mentioned.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that due to previous treatments, the assessment of adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) is not feasible. It doesn't directly state that there are or aren't malignant tumor findings; it simply states that an assessment cannot be made. Thus, we can't conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings due to the impact of prior therapies. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be determined.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found," indicating that the actual Gleason grade could not be determined. It suggests a hypothetical Gleason score but doesn't report an actual Gleason grade due to the effects of previous therapies on the tissue. Thus, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not reported or determinable.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly allow for differentiation based on severity due to its nature), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the interpretation that the sample type is most likely a biopsy due to the extensive sampling described, malignant tumor findings are "NA" because they cannot be assessed, and the Gleason grade is "NA" as it's not determinable from the provided information.
