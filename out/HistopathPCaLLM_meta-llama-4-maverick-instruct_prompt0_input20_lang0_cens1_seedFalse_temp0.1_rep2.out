To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets ranging from apex, middle, and basis region." It indicates that tissue samples were taken, but it doesn't directly state the method. However, given the context and the detail that samples are from different regions of the prostate, it suggests a significant sampling, which is more aligned with a biopsy or possibly a radical prostatectomy (RP) given the detail about different regions. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a possibility but less likely given the description of sampling from apex to basis. The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type as TURP or RP with certainty, but it implies a detailed sampling that could be from a biopsy or RP. However, the exact method isn't clearly stated, making "biopsy" a plausible assumption due to the mention of multiple samples from different regions.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that due to previous treatments, the assessment for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) couldn't be conclusively made. However, it mentions "possible adenocarcinoma," suggesting that there was a context or suspicion of cancer, but it doesn't confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings due to the impact of previous therapies. Thus, it's challenging to definitively categorize this as "yes" or "no" for malignant findings. The statement leans towards uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found," indicating that if cancer were present and assessable, a Gleason score might be considered. However, it doesn't report an actual Gleason grade due to the effects of previous therapies on the tissue. Thus, there's no actual Gleason score provided.

Given these considerations:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, let's choose "biopsy" as it's a reasonable assumption based on the detailed sampling described.
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, the statement doesn't confirm the presence or absence due to the effects of previous treatments, so "NA" seems appropriate due to the uncertainty.
- For the **Reported Gleason Grade**, since there's no actual Gleason score reported due to the tissue being "highly affected" by previous therapies, "NA" is the appropriate response.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" where appropriate.
