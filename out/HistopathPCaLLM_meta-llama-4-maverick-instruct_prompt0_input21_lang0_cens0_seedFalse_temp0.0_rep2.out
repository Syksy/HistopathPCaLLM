To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a sample obtained through a procedure. "Prostate chippings" is commonly associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
   - Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and mentions that "Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," which are indicative of malignant changes.
   - It also states that "Roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue," further supporting the presence of a malignant tumor.
   - Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4."
   - This implies the Gleason score is calculated as the sum of the most common and the second most common grades, which gives us 5 (major) + 4 (minor) = 9 (sum).
   - Therefore, the Gleason grade is "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields as per the instructions, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
