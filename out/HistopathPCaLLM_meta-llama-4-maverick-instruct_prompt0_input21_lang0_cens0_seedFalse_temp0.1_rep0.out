To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a sample obtained through a procedure related to prostate tissue. "Chippings" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and mentions that "roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as "5+4". To determine the sum: 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "5+4=9".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
