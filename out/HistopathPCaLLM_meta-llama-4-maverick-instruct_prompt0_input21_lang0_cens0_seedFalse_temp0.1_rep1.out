To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample. TURP is a surgical procedure used to treat an enlarged prostate, and it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma," "Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and mentions that "roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue." These descriptions are indicative of malignant findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 5 (major) + 4 (minor) = 9 (sum). Therefore, the Gleason grade is "5+4=9."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
