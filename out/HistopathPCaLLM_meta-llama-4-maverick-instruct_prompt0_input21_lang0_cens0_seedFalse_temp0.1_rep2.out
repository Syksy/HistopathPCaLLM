To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a sample obtained through a procedure related to prostate tissue. "Chippings" is often associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma," "Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible," and mentions that "roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue." These descriptions indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as "5+4". To determine the sum: 5 + 4 = 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "5+4=9".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sampleType`: "TURP"
- `malignantFindings`: "yes"
- `gleasonGrade`: "5+4=9"
