To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is not a whole prostate (RP) but rather fragments. The weight and size suggest it could be from a biopsy or TURP. However, the fact that there are "several fragments" and a significant amount of tissue is mentioned (3/5g) might lean more towards TURP, as biopsies are typically smaller. Yet, without explicit mention of chips or fragments typical of TURP, and given the context, it's more likely to be a biopsy due to the size of the fragments (up to 8mm) and the fact that "about half been put to histology," which is a common practice in biopsies.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed," which might suggest some form of abnormal growth. However, it also mentions that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material." This implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. Despite these challenges, there's no clear statement that the sample is malignant or benign; it's more that the assessment is hindered by technical issues.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Given the difficulties in assessing the sample due to "technical noise" and "nuclei are dissolved," determining a Gleason grade is not feasible according to the statement. The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate tissues, but here, even the assessment of malignancy is complicated.

Based on the analysis:

- **Original Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the context provided.
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of malignancy is not clearly ascertainable ("NA") due to the poor quality of the sample and the inability to assess cell differentiation patterns.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample's quality does not allow for a proper assessment, and there's no clear indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity or even the presence of malignancy is uncertain).
