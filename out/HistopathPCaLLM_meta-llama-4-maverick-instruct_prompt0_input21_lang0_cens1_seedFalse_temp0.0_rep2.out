To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is not a whole prostate (RP) but rather fragments. The weight and size suggest it could be from a biopsy or TURP. However, the fact that there are "several fragments" and a significant amount of tissue is involved (3/5g) might lean more towards TURP, as biopsies are typically smaller. Yet, without explicit mention of chips or fragments typical of TURP, and given the context, it might be more appropriate to consider it as "biopsy" due to the lack of clear indication that it's TURP. However, the description doesn't perfectly fit the typical biopsy either. Despite this, "biopsy" seems a plausible choice given the context.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of cancer, but it also talks about significant technical issues ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns") and a substantial portion of the material being "too noisy" for proper assessment. Despite these challenges, the mention of "carpet-like growth" could suggest malignancy. However, the overall tone and the issues with the sample quality make a definitive diagnosis challenging. Still, based on the information given, it seems there is a suspicion or indication of malignancy ("carpet-like growth"), so "yes" could be considered.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that technical issues ("technical noise") and the condition of the nuclei ("nuclei are dissolved") confound the assessment of cell differentiation patterns, which are crucial for determining the Gleason grade. Therefore, a Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined from the provided information, making "NA" the appropriate answer.

Given the analysis:

- **Original Sample Type**: "biopsy" (due to the lack of clear indication of TURP or RP, and despite the size, it seems the most plausible given the context).
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "yes" (because of the mention of "carpet-like growth" suggestive of malignancy, despite the diagnostic challenges).
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since the technical issues prevent the assessment of the Gleason grade).

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data as requested.
