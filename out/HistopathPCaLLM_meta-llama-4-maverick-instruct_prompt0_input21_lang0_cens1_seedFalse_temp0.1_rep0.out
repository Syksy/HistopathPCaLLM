To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is not a whole prostate (RP) but rather fragments. The weight and size suggest it could be from a biopsy or TURP. However, the fact that there are "several fragments" and a significant amount of tissue is involved (3/5g) might lean more towards TURP, as biopsies are typically smaller. Yet, without explicit mention of chips or fragments typical of TURP, and given the context, it's more likely to be a biopsy due to the lack of specific indicators for TURP or RP. Thus, the most reasonable interpretation based on the information given is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of cancer, but it also states that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." Moreover, it notes that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material," suggesting that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. However, the presence of "carpet-like growth" could imply a suspicion or indication of malignancy, but it's not conclusive. The statement does not directly confirm malignancy due to the technical issues. Thus, the answer could be considered as "NA" due to the inability to conclusively determine malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Given that the statement does not provide a clear assessment of malignancy due to technical issues and does not mention a Gleason grade, and considering that Gleason grading is typically applied to malignant tumors, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the provided histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the lesion's severity is not clearly determinable).
