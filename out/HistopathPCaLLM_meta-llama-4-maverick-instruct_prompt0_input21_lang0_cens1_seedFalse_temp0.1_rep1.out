To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is not a whole prostate (RP) but rather fragments. The weight and size suggest it could be from a biopsy or TURP. However, the fact that there are "several fragments" and a significant amount of tissue is involved (3/5g) might lean more towards TURP, as biopsies are typically smaller. Yet, without explicit mention of prostatic chips or the procedure, we must be cautious. Still, given the context, "TURP" seems a plausible choice over "biopsy" due to the quantity of tissue.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed," which might suggest some form of abnormal growth. However, it also mentions that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material." This implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. The statement does not directly confirm or deny malignancy but suggests that the material is not suitable for a conclusive diagnosis due to technical issues. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings, making "NA" a reasonable choice due to the uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Given that the assessment of cell differentiation patterns is confounded by technical noise and the material is not suitable for a conclusive diagnosis, the Gleason grade cannot be determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since a definitive grading requires a clearer assessment of the tissue architecture and cellular differentiation, which is not possible here.

Based on the analysis:

- **Original Sample Type**: "TURP" (Given the quantity of tissue and context, though not definitive.)
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "NA" (Due to the inability to assess the sample properly.)
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "NA" (As the sample quality does not allow for a reliable grading.)

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by providing a flat structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
