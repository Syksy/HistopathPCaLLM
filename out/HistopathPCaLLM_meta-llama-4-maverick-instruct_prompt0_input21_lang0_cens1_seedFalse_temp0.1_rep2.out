To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is not a whole prostate (RP) but rather fragments. The weight and size suggest it could be from a biopsy or TURP. However, the fact that it's "several fragments" and the context doesn't explicitly indicate a resection (like TURP typically involves), but given the quantity and the fact that it's prostate material, it's more likely to be TURP or biopsy. The description leans more towards a biopsy due to the mention of fragments being "up to 8mm a piece" and the context not strongly suggesting a TURP. However, without explicit indication, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the fragmented nature and the size of the fragments.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of a tumor, but it also mentions that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." This implies that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. However, the presence of "carpet-like growth" could suggest a neoplastic process. Despite this, the statement does not conclusively state that the findings are malignant, and it suggests revisiting the material after QC, indicating uncertainty. Thus, it might be best to categorize this as "NA" due to the inability to conclusively determine malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns," which directly implies that determining the Gleason grade is not feasible with the current sample quality. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since the sample's condition does not allow for an accurate assessment.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Identifying the original sample type as "biopsy" based on the context.
- Marking "malignantTumorFindings" as "NA" due to the uncertainty and quality issues with the sample.
- Reporting "gleasonGrade" as "NA" because the sample's condition prevents an accurate Gleason grading.
