To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments "exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason score is mentioned as "3 and secondly of score 4." This implies the major grade is 3, and the minor grade is 4. The sum of these grades is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "3+4=7."

Since the statement contains information about both benign and malignant findings but from different sides of the biopsy, and the task is to report on the most severe lesion, we focus on the malignant findings which are more severe. The left side has carcinoma with a Gleason score, making it the more severe lesion.

The structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (the left side with malignancy), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
