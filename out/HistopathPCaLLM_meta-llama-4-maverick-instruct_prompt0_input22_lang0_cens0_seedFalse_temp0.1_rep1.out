To solve this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "a container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both sides." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments "exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Although the right side fragments do not exhibit signs of malignancies, the presence of malignancy on the left side is enough to conclude that there were malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the left side fragments "firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4. To determine the sum, we add the major and minor scores: 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Since we are only required to return the results from the most severe lesion and the statement provides information about a malignant lesion on the left side, we will use the information related to this lesion.

Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required by the task.
