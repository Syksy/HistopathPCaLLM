To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragments from both the left and right sides, indicating it is a biopsy. The terms "fragmentation" and "fragments" further support this, as they are commonly used in the context of biopsy samples. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement notes that the fragments "exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. It also mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy due to the sample's condition, rather than a definitive absence of malignancy. However, the context suggests that there are suspicions or indications that could be related to malignancy (e.g., "abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types"), but it's not conclusively stated as malignant. The statement leans towards an inability to confirm malignancy due to the sample's condition. Thus, the most appropriate answer based on the given allowed values is "NA" because the presence of malignancy cannot be confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates that a Gleason score was not provided or determined. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the lesion's severity or even presence is uncertain) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
