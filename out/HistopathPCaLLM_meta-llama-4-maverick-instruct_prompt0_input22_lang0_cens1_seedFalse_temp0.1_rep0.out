To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragments from both the left and right sides, which is indicative of a biopsy. The terms "fragmentation" and "fragments" further support this, as biopsies often involve taking small samples of tissue. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the fragments "exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. It also mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This implies that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy was not made, likely due to the quality or condition of the samples. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed, which aligns more with "NA" (not available or not assessable) rather than a clear "yes" or "no" due to the inability to assess.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason score is "exceptionally difficult" and that the samples need to be reprocessed. This indicates that a Gleason grade was not reported or could not be determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions, the overall assessment is applied as per the given text), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements:
- `originalSampleType` is "biopsy".
- `malignantTumorFindings` is "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm malignancy due to the samples being unassessable.
- `gleasonGrade` is "NA" as it was not reported or determined.
