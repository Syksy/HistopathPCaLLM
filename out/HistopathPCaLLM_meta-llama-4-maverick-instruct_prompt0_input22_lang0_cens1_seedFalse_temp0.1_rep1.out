To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragments from both the left and right sides, which is indicative of a biopsy. There's no explicit mention of it being a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the fragments "exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. However, it also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This implies that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy could not be made due to the condition and quality of the samples. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings. The closest answer would be "NA" because the assessment for malignancy was not possible.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason score is exceptionally difficult and that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies, it implies that a Gleason grade was not reported or could not be determined. Therefore, the answer to the Gleason grade is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the assessment was inconclusive) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
