To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragments from both the left and right sides, which is indicative of a biopsy. There's no explicit mention of it being a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Thus, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the fragments "exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. However, it explicitly states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This implies that due to the high fragmentation and varying nature of the samples, a definitive assessment of malignancy couldn't be made. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed, leaning towards "NA" because the assessment couldn't be completed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement directly mentions that assigning a Gleason score is "exceptionally difficult" and that the material "cannot be assessed for malignancies." This implies that a Gleason grade was not reported due to the challenges in assessing the sample. Hence, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't definitively identify a malignant lesion) would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the information given in the statement.
