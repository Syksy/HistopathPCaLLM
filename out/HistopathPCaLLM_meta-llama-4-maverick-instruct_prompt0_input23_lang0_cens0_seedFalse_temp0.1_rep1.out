To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed for further investigation." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates the presence of "adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides the Gleason score as "Gleason-score sum 9" and further details that the major differentiation stage is 4 and the second most common stage is 5. It implies the Gleason score is calculated as "4+5=9." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade in the required format is "4+5=9."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
