To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and later refers to reprocessing the sample with a focus on the apex. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context (mention of ultrasound report, palpation, and regions like apex, mid-section, and basis), it suggests a significant surgical specimen. However, the exact type isn't clearly mentioned. Since it's not explicitly stated as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and considering the context might imply a more extensive specimen like RP, but without clear indication, the safest categorization based on the information given would be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings." This implies there were suspicions or indications of malignancy, as Gleason score is used for prostate cancer. Thus, it suggests malignant tumor findings were potentially present, so the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to a "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior report. However, it doesn't provide a complete Gleason score in the form of "major+minor=sum." For the purpose of this task and based on the information given, we can't accurately fill in the Gleason score as it's not fully reported. The mention of "Gleason 3" likely refers to a component of the Gleason score, but without the full score, we can't accurately represent it in the required "major+minor=sum" format. Thus, we will have to consider it as "NA" for the purpose of this structured data, as we cannot accurately infer the complete Gleason score.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields, focusing on the most severe lesion (implied by the context of reprocessing the sample to validate initial suspicions of malignancy).
