To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "parts of a prepared sample set" and the need for "further investigation" and "reprocessed," which could imply a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Thus, the most likely sample type based on the context is "biopsy." So, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in the context of a prior incomplete report of sampled apex. This implies that there were suspicions or indications of malignancy, but it doesn't directly state that malignant tumor findings were confirmed in the current sample. The conclusion to reprocess the sample to "validate the initial suspicions" suggests that the presence of malignancy was not definitively confirmed. Therefore, we can infer that there were indications or suspicions of malignancy, so the answer could be considered as "yes" due to the mention of Gleason grade, which is typically used for malignant tumors.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings." There's no clear major and minor grade provided, nor a sum. However, since it's mentioned as "Gleason 3," we might infer that it's referring to a tumor with a Gleason score where one of the components is 3. For simplicity and following the instruction for malignant statements, if we were to assume a scenario where the Gleason score was to be reported and assuming the "3" refers to one component, without a clear major and minor, we can't directly fill in the "major+minor=sum" format. However, since the statement is not definitive about the Gleason score of the current sample and is more about a suspicion, and given the lack of a clear Gleason score, one might argue it should be "NA." But, adhering strictly to the information given and the fact that we're dealing with a potentially malignant context, one might still want to represent the available information.

Given these considerations, here's a structured JSON response. Note that we're interpreting the task as requiring us to provide the most severe lesion's details, and the statement hints at but doesn't directly confirm malignancy or provide a complete Gleason score.

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind choosing "yes" for malignant tumor findings is based on the context that Gleason grading is typically used for malignant tumors, and there's a mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings." However, the lack of a definitive diagnosis in the provided statement could also justify "NA" for malignant tumor findings. The "reportedGleasonGrade" is "NA" because, despite the mention of "Gleason 3," a complete Gleason score (major+minor=sum) isn't provided, and the statement is about reprocessing to validate initial suspicions rather than a definitive diagnosis.

Thus, the JSON response reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the given instructions and the nuances of the statement provided.
