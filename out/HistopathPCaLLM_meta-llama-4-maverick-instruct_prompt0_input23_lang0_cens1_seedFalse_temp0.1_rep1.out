To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and later refers to reprocessing the sample with a focus on the apex. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context of reprocessing and the initial suspicion based on ultrasound and palpation, we can infer it's likely related to a biopsy or a surgical specimen. However, the exact type isn't specified. Since it doesn't clearly indicate "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and given the context that it might not directly relate to any of these standard types or the information is not directly available, the most appropriate response based on the information given would be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings." Gleason score is used to grade prostate cancer, indicating that there were malignant tumor findings suspected or identified. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes" because Gleason scoring is associated with prostate cancer.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to a "potential Gleason 3 findings." Typically, a Gleason score is reported as a sum of two numbers (e.g., Gleason 3+4=7). The mention of "Gleason 3" likely refers to a component of the Gleason score rather than the full score. However, it's the only information provided. For the purpose of structuring this data and given that we are to prioritize the most severe lesion and the statement implies an incomplete reporting, we'll have to interpret this as the available Gleason information. Since a full Gleason score isn't provided (i.e., both the major and minor components and their sum), and assuming the "3" refers to a part of the Gleason score, we still can't accurately fill in the "major+minor=sum" format. However, given the available information and the need to follow instructions, we might consider it as an indication of a malignant finding but will mark it as "NA" due to the incomplete nature of the Gleason score provided.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Not providing nested structures.
- Focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned (implied by the context of reprocessing for suspected malignancy).
- Using the allowed values for each field.
