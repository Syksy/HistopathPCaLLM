To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "parts of a prepared sample set" and the need for "further investigation" and "reprocessed," which could imply a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Thus, the most likely sample type based on the context is "biopsy." So, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in the context of a prior incomplete report of sampled apex. This implies that there were suspicions or indications of malignant tumor findings, as Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings." Typically, a Gleason score is reported as the sum of the major and minor grades (e.g., "3+4=7"). The statement only mentions "Gleason 3," which is not a complete Gleason score. However, it's the only information available regarding the Gleason grade. For the purpose of this task and to adhere to the required format as closely as possible, we might interpret this as an incomplete report. Still, we can attempt to structure it. Assuming "Gleason 3" implies a possible score but lacking the full details, a strict interpretation following the given format isn't directly possible. However, since we need to provide an answer and the statement is about a malignant finding, we could consider it as implying a score but will directly use "NA" due to the lack of a complete score.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and avoiding nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing the required fields in a non-nested format. The "reportedGleasonGrade" is marked as "NA" due to the incomplete information provided in the statement regarding the full Gleason score.
