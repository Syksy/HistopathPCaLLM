To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates the presence of a "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which is a type of malignant tumor. Thus, there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." This implies that the Gleason score is 8, which is typically represented as the sum of two grades (e.g., 4+4=8). Since it doesn't specify the major and minor grades but implies a score of 8 likely from 4+4, we can infer the Gleason grade as "4+4=8".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+4=8".
