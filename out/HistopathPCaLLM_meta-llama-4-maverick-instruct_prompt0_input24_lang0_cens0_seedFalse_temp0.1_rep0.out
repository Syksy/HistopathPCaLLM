To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings by mentioning "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason grade, mentioning "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." This implies the Gleason score is 8. To adhere to the preferred format "major+minor=sum," and assuming the sum is derived from the major and minor grades, we can infer that the Gleason score is likely "4+4=8" since it's a common pattern for Gleason scoring. However, the exact major and minor grades aren't directly stated, but given the information that it's a Gleason 4 tumor and sums to 8, it's reasonable to represent it as "4+4=8".

Therefore, structuring the information according to the given requirements:

- Original Sample Type: "TURP"
- Malignant Tumor Findings: "yes"
- Reported Gleason Grade: "4+4=8"

In valid JSON format, the structured data is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing the required information in a non-nested structure and focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement.
