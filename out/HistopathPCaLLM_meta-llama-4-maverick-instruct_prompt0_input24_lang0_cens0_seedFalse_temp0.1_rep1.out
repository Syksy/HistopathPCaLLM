To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "comfirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings." TURP stands for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate, so the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Although it doesn't explicitly state the major and minor grades, it implies a Gleason score of 8. A common representation for a Gleason score of 8 could be "4+4=8". Since the statement doesn't provide the exact major and minor grades but implies a score of 8, and given that it's a TURP sample with a significant proportion of tumor, assuming "4+4=8" is reasonable for the purpose of this task.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sampleType`: "TURP"
- `malignantFindings`: "yes"
- `gleasonGrade`: "4+4=8"
