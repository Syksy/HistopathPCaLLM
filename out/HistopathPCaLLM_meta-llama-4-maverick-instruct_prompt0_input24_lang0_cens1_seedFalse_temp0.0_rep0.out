To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "shavings" can be interpreted as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The most relevant sample types mentioned are "biopsies" and "radical prostatectomies." Since "radical prostatectomies" is abbreviated as "RP," we have "biopsy" and "RP" as relevant sample types. The statement does not specify a single sample type for a particular case but mentions multiple sample types were used. However, for the purpose of this task, we need to identify the most severe lesion's sample type. The statement doesn't directly link a sample type to a malignant or severe finding. Therefore, based on the information given and the fact that we're dealing with a collection of samples, we'll have to consider the context of "malignant tumor findings" and "Gleason grade" to infer the relevance of sample types.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that some initially benign cases were "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" upon re-evaluation, which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings in some cases. It specifically mentions that there was upgrading to malignant scores (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4) in about 1/4 of the cases, indicating that the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that some cases were upgraded to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4." The most severe Gleason grade mentioned here is "3+4." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion:

- The original sample type is not directly linked to the most severe lesion, but "biopsy" is a common sample type for initial assessments and could be considered relevant. However, "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is also significant and often associated with more severe or confirmed cases. Since the statement doesn't directly tie the sample type to the severity, and given that "biopsy" is often used for initial diagnosis which can include assessing severity, we'll consider "biopsy" as a plausible sample type for the context of identifying malignant findings.
- There were malignant tumor findings: "yes."
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This response adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the given statement.
