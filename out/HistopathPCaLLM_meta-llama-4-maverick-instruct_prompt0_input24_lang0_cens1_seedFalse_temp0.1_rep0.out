To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "shavings" can be interpreted as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Radical prostatectomies are referred to as "RP." So, the sample types mentioned are "biopsy," "RP," and "TURP." Since the statement refers to "multiple sets of patients" and doesn't specify a single sample type for all cases, we need to identify the most relevant or severe context. However, the task requires us to return a single value. Given that the statement doesn't directly relate to a specific patient's diagnosis but rather discusses a collection of cases used for teaching, we'll have to infer based on the information given. The presence of "radical prostatectomies" indicates a significant or more severe context, as RP is typically performed for cancer treatment.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement discusses cases that were initially benign but some of which were "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" upon re-evaluation. This indicates that there were malignant tumor findings in some cases. The statement explicitly mentions that the material was initially "post-benign diagnosis," but upon re-evaluation, some were found to have malignant characteristics. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that some cases were "upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4." The most severe Gleason grade mentioned is "3+4." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion or context:

- The original sample type is not directly tied to a single case but mentions "radical prostatectomies" among others, which suggests a significant context. So, we can consider "RP" as a relevant sample type for the context of potentially malignant findings.
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The most severe Gleason grade reported is "3+4=7."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data based on the given text, focusing on the most severe lesion or context provided.
