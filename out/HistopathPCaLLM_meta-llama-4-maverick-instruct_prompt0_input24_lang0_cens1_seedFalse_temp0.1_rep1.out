To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "shavings" can be interpreted as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Since the statement refers to multiple types of samples and doesn't specify a single type for the most severe lesion, we need to identify the most relevant or severe context. Radical prostatectomy (RP) is generally associated with malignant findings or more severe lesions when compared to biopsies or TURP in the context of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the most severe context is likely related to "radical prostatectomies" (RP).

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the original material was "post-benign diagnosis" and that in some cases, the benign material was upgraded to Gleason scores indicative of malignancy (e.g., Gleason 3+3 or 3+4). This implies that there were malignant tumor findings in some of the samples.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions upgrading to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" and specifically mentions "Gleason 6" (which corresponds to 3+3=6). The most severe Gleason score mentioned is 3+4.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion:

- The original sample type is most likely "RP" because it's associated with a more severe context.
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The most severe Gleason grade reported is "3+4=7".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the most severe lesion described in the statement.
