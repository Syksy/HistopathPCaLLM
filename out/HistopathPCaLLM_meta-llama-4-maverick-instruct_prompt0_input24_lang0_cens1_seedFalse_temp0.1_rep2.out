To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "shavings" can be interpreted as TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). So, the sample types mentioned are "biopsy," "radical prostatectomies" (RP), and "TURP." Since the task is to identify the sample type for the most severe lesion and the statement does not directly correlate a specific sample type with the severity, we will have to infer based on the information about malignancy and Gleason grade.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that some initially benign cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4 upon re-evaluation, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings in some cases. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4. The most severe lesion mentioned has a Gleason grade of 3+4=7.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion:

- The original sample type is not directly linked to the severity but multiple types are mentioned. Since "biopsy," "RP," and "TURP" are all mentioned and there's no direct correlation with the severity, and considering that the most severe lesion is related to malignant findings which could be from any of these, we might consider "biopsy" as it's directly related to the upgrading of cases. However, the statement does not explicitly state that the most severe lesions were from biopsies. Therefore, we should consider the context of "most severe lesion" which is related to the Gleason score. For the purpose of this task and given the lack of direct correlation, we might lean towards "NA" if we cannot definitively associate the sample type with the severity. However, since "biopsy" is a common sample type for assessing malignancy and Gleason grade, and given the context, one might argue it's a plausible choice.

- There were malignant tumor findings: "yes."

- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and using the allowed values, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "biopsy" is chosen here for "originalSampleType," the statement does not explicitly link the sample type to the severity of the lesion. A more conservative approach without making assumptions beyond the given text could result in a different choice for "originalSampleType." Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the information provided and the specific request for format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions and provides a structured answer in JSON format.
