To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" with descriptions that imply they are biopsy samples because it talks about "tissue cylinders" and specific lengths. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "tumor growth" and "tumor tissue" in samples (1) and (2), and concludes with the presence of "prostate adenocarcinoma". Thus, there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Both samples (1) and (2) contain tumor with Gleason patterns. For sample (1), it's Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and 3 (approx 30%), and for sample (2), it's Gleason pattern 4 (approx 15%) and 3 (less than 35%). To determine the most severe lesion, we need to calculate the Gleason score for both. 
   - For sample (1), if we assume the percentages directly correlate to the primary and secondary patterns, the major pattern is 3 and the minor is 4, making the score 3+4=7.
   - For sample (2), similarly, the major pattern is 3 and the minor is 4, making the score 3+4=7.
   Since both have the same Gleason score, we need to look for other indicators of severity. Sample (2) has a larger total length (10mm vs 8+6mm for sample 1, but the latter is a sum of two cylinders) and a larger proportion of tumor involvement relative to the sample size (5mm out of 10mm vs 4mm out of the longer cylinder, which is roughly 14mm total length). However, the decision on the most severe lesion isn't directly inferable from the given data without more context on how to weigh these factors. For simplicity, we can consider both samples as having the same severity based on Gleason score, and report the Gleason grade as "3+4=7".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the most severe lesion(s) identified.
