Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Sample (1) contains two tissue cylinders, with the length 8+6mm. In the longer one, approximately 4mm in length (about half of total length) contains tumor growth, with Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%. Sample (2) single 10mm, with tumor tissue approx 5mm in length and differentation stage Gleason 4 approx 15% and 3 stage less than 35%. Sample (3) contains 5+5mm, in which no abnormal prostate tissue is observed. Samples (1) and (2) also contain PIN-changes. Thus, conclusion based on above samples is presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.
