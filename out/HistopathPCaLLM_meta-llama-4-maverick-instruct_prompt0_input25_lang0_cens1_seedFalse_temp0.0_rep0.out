To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" with descriptions indicating they are all biopsy samples due to the context of being "tissue sample shapes" and "fragmented tissue material." There's no explicit mention of it being "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and the nature of the samples suggests they are biopsies. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma "cannot be reliably verified" due to the limitations in assessing the samples. This implies that there is uncertainty or insufficient evidence to conclusively state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. However, it does not directly state that the findings are malignant or benign; it simply states that a reliable conclusion cannot be made. The closest interpretation based on the allowed values is "NA" since the statement does not conclusively confirm or deny the presence of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that assessing Gleason differentiation patterns was attempted for Sample (1) but due to "differing views," the case will be discussed further. It implies that a definitive Gleason grade was not assigned or reported due to the complexities or uncertainties in the assessment. For Sample (2), it is stated that differentiation could not be assessed. Therefore, a Gleason grade is not reported, and based on the allowed values, the appropriate response would be "NA."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's characteristics (though in this case, the presence of malignancy or its characteristics could not be reliably determined).
- Returning the structured results in valid JSON format without nested structures.
- Using the allowed values for each field.
