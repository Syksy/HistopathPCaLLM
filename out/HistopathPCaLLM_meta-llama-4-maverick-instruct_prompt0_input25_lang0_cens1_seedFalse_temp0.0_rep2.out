To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given that it discusses multiple samples with varying characteristics (e.g., "multi-faceted tissue sample shapes," "fragmented tissue material"), it is reasonable to infer that the samples are likely from a biopsy due to the description of the samples and the fact that a definitive assessment of prostate adenocarcinoma presence couldn't be made, which is common in biopsy samples. There's no clear indication that it's from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma could not be reliably verified due to the nature of the samples and the initial suspicion of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) changes being retracted. This implies that there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "NA" because the presence or absence couldn't be confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not provided for any sample. Sample (1) is discussed in terms of Gleason differentiation patterns, but a specific grade is not given, and it's mentioned that the case will be discussed further. Sample (2) is noted as not being assessable for differentiation. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive assessment.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's data (though in this case, no malignant lesion was confirmed).
- Not using nested structures.
- Using the allowed values for each field.
