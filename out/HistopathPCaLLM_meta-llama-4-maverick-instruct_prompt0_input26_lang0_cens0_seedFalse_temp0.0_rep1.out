To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is one of the allowed values.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "Histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor," which confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason grade by saying "where the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4. To calculate the sum: 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7", adhering to the "major+minor=sum" format.
