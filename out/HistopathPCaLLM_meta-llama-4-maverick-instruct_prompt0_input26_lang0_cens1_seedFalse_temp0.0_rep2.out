To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions samples marked with indices A-C for material attributed to apex and indices D-F for sources closer to basis, indicating it is a prostate sample. However, it doesn't directly state if it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context that the material is from the prostate and is divided into sections from apex to basis, and considering the clinical context (recent radiation therapy and assessment of spread), it's plausible that the sample is from a significant surgical procedure. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't clearly stated. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and given the context, we might lean towards "biopsy" due to the mention of "samples" and the clinical context, but it's not a clear indication. Therefore, without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the given information would be "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" and discusses the impact of recent radiation therapy on histopathological assessment, implying that there was or is suspicion of malignancy. However, it also states that due to recent RT (radiation therapy), the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory. This implies that there was an expectation or context of malignancy, but the current histological inspection is complicated by the recent RT. Thus, we can infer that there were malignant tumor findings or at least a strong suspicion of them. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" and questions whether it is GG (Gleason Grade) 2 or 3, indicating uncertainty about the exact Gleason score components but suggesting a sum of 7. However, it's noted that it's unclear if this sum was verified. For the purpose of structuring the data, we will take the mentioned "Gleason sum 7" as the most relevant information. A common representation for Gleason score is "major+minor=sum". Without specific major and minor grades provided but knowing the sum is 7, and assuming a typical representation, we could consider common combinations like "3+4=7". However, since the exact major and minor grades aren't specified and we're instructed to provide a simple representation, we'll directly use the sum as the basis of our answer. Thus, the Gleason grade could be represented as "NA" because the exact verified Gleason score isn't provided, and there's uncertainty. However, since there's a specific mention of "Gleason sum 7", one might argue for using it. To adhere strictly to the instructions and given the uncertainty, "NA" might be more appropriate.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and not using nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the allowed values and the instruction to not return nested structures, focusing on the most severe lesion implied in the statement.
