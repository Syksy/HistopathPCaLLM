To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." This context suggests that the sample is from a procedure that involves removing or shaving tissue, which is most likely a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) given the context of "shavings" and the quantity of tissue.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason grade for the carcinoma detected, stating "where the growth pattern was Gleason 3+3=6." This directly gives us the Gleason score in the required format.

Given these observations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is the only lesion mentioned with a Gleason score), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+3=6"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:

1. The original sample type is "TURP".
2. There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "3+3=6".
