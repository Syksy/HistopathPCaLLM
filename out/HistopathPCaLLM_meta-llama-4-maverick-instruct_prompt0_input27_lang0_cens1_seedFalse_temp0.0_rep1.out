To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." This indicates that the tissue was processed, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "source prostate tissue," which could imply a significant sample. The terms "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are specific types of prostate tissue samples. "RP" typically involves a larger amount of tissue and is a surgical removal of the prostate. "TURP" is also known for involving significant tissue but is more associated with symptom relief rather than diagnostic sampling. "Biopsy" usually involves smaller samples. The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given the context (tissue run in batches, histological inspection), it suggests a substantial sample. However, without explicit mention, we must infer or directly state "NA" if unsure.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions that "the growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation," which implies an examination for tumor characteristics. It also mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." The presence of a discussion around Gleason score implies that there are malignant or potentially malignant cells, as Gleason score is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Thus, it suggests malignant tumor findings, albeit not definitively or in significant quantities.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." This implies that there is some discussion around a Gleason score, but it's not definitive. For prostate cancer, the Gleason score is typically reported as a sum of two numbers (e.g., "3+4=7"). Here, only a single number is mentioned (Gleason score 3), and it's not clear if this refers to a primary or secondary pattern, or if a secondary pattern was even identified. The statement lacks a clear "major+minor=sum" format.

Given these observations:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, the statement doesn't directly indicate the type, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, despite the ambiguity, the mention of Gleason score suggests there are malignant findings, so "yes" could be considered.
- For the **Reported Gleason Grade**, the statement is ambiguous and doesn't follow the "major+minor=sum" format. It mentions a possible Gleason score of 3, but without a clear sum or both numbers, it's not in the desired format. However, it implies an attempt to assess Gleason grade.

Therefore, structuring the data based on the given instructions and the most severe lesion (or the information available), we get:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate structured data based on the given text and the specified requirements. The "reportedGleasonGrade" is marked as "NA" because the information provided doesn't fit the required "major+minor=sum" format, and it's not a clear or definitive assessment.
