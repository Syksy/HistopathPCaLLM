To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders," indicating that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes findings of adenocarcinoma in multiple foci, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason classifications for multiple foci. The most severe lesion is identified as Focus #1 with a Gleason classification of 4+4=8. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "biopsy."
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8."
