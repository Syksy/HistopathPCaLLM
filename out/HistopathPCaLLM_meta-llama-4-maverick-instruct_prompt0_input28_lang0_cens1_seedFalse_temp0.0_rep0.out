To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "six different sites of interest" and refers to "Region of interest #1", "#2", etc., indicating that the sample is taken for examination due to elevated PSA status. The context suggests that the sample is obtained through a biopsy since it involves examining multiple specific regions of interest within the prostate. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns", "odd growth patterns", and "possible pre-malignant changes" in the regions of interest. However, it does not explicitly confirm malignant tumor findings. The presence of "hyperplastic changes" is also noted. The text suggests that the findings are not conclusively malignant but warrant further inspection. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively stated; hence, the answer leans towards "NA" or "no" based on the information given. Since it's not a clear "yes", and given the context that it doesn't rule out malignancy but doesn't confirm it either, the most appropriate answer based on the given choices is "no" because it doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignant findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "unclear differentiation staging" and "possible pre-malignant changes" but does not give a specific Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" as it is related to malignant statements, and this statement does not confirm malignancy.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion implicitly by addressing the overall conclusion drawn from the regions of interest examined.
