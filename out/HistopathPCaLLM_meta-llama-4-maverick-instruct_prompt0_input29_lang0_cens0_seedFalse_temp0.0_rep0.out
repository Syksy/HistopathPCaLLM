To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**

The statement mentions that "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." and describes how samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. The weight and the description of sampling suggest a significant portion of the prostate was removed and examined. The sample type is not explicitly "biopsy" because biopsies are typically smaller samples. The description fits more with a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which involves the surgical removal of the prostate gland.

Therefore, the original sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**

The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the left lobe samples (A and C), describing characteristics of the tumor such as penetration through the capsule, perineural invasion, and differentiation patterns. Thus, there were malignant tumor findings.

Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**

The Gleason grade is mentioned in the summary: "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." The Gleason score is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on how much the tumor tissue looks like normal prostate tissue under a microscope. The score ranges from 2 to 10, with higher scores indicating a more aggressive cancer. The statement implies a Gleason score of 7 but does not directly state the major and minor grades. However, it describes that "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4," which seems to be a typographical error or confusion because it mentions "grade 4" twice. Typically, a Gleason score of 7 could be either 3+4 or 4+3. Given the description that "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed," it is more likely that the Gleason score is 4+3=7.

Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

### Structured Data in JSON Format

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",

}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
