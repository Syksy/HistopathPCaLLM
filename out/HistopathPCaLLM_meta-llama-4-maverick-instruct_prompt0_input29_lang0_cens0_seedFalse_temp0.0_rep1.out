To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**

The statement mentions that the "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." It further details how samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. The specimen described is a prostate gland with a significant weight, which is more characteristic of a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). RP specimens are typically larger and weighed, whereas biopsies are much smaller samples. TURP specimens can vary in size but are usually obtained for relief of urinary obstruction and not typically described with the detailed anatomical sampling as in this case. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**

The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the samples taken from the left lobe, describing characteristics of the tumor such as penetration through the capsule, perineural invasion, and differentiation patterns. Thus, there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**

The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." It then concludes with "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." The Gleason score is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on how much the tumor cells resemble normal prostate cells. A Gleason score is typically presented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns. The statement seems to have a typographical error or confusion in describing the Gleason pattern, as it mentions "mostly grade 4... with the smaller portion as grade 4," which would not directly sum to 7 unless one interprets it as having a primary and secondary pattern that sums to 7 (e.g., 4+3=7 or 3+4=7). The summary directly states "Score sum 7," which we will take as the basis for our answer. Assuming the most severe lesion is being described and it has a Gleason score sum of 7, and given the description leans more towards a higher grade (with "mostly grade 4"), a plausible interpretation could be "4+3=7". 

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```
