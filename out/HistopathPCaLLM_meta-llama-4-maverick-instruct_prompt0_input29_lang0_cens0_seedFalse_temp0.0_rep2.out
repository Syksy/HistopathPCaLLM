To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**

The statement mentions that the "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g." It further details how samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. The specimen described is a prostate gland with a significant weight, which is more characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Biopsy specimens are typically much smaller and not weighed in the same manner, and TURP specimens, while potentially large, are usually chipped or fragmented. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**

The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the left lobe samples (A and C), describing characteristics of the tumor such as penetration through the capsule, perineural invasion, and differentiation patterns. Thus, there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**

The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." It then concludes with "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." The Gleason score is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on how much the tumor cells resemble normal prostate cells. A Gleason score is typically presented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns. The statement seems to imply a Gleason score of 4+3=7, as it mentions "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4", which could be interpreted as a primary pattern of 4 and a secondary pattern of 3, summing to 7.

Therefore, based on the information given and the analysis above, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement. Note that the Gleason grade is represented as "4+3=7", adhering to the "major+minor=sum" format.
