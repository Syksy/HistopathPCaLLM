To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and samples were taken from different parts of the prostate (left lower, right lower, left middle, right middle, left higher, right higher). This indicates the samples were taken through a biopsy procedure since it involves sampling tissue from different parts of the prostate. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions that "From sample indices A and C non-prostatic tissue is observed" and that there's a concern about contamination. It also talks about assessing "differentiation stages of tumor cells" and "potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure observations," which implies the presence of tumor cells or suspicion thereof. However, it does not directly state that malignant tumor findings were confirmed. The focus is on the assessment that could not be completed due to issues with the samples. Despite this, the context suggests that there was a reason to suspect malignancy or to assess for it, implying that malignant findings were possible or suspected. The statement does not directly confirm malignancy but implies an investigation for it. However, given the context, we can infer that malignant tumor findings were potentially being investigated, but it's not a clear "yes". The statement is more about the inability to assess certain features due to sample issues. Therefore, we might lean towards "yes" due to the context of assessing tumor cells, but it's a bit ambiguous.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," which directly refers to the Gleason score. This implies that the Gleason grade could not be determined or reported due to issues with the samples. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not possible to determine it.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare severity across samples, it implies issues across samples A and C), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

Here's the reasoning in brief for the choices:
- **originalSampleType**: "biopsy" because the statement describes sampling from different parts of the prostate.
- **malignantTumorFindings**: "yes" because the context implies an investigation into tumor cells or malignancy, even though it's not a direct confirmation.
- **gleasonGrade**: "NA" because the statement explicitly says the Gleason score sum determination was not possible.

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data as requested.
