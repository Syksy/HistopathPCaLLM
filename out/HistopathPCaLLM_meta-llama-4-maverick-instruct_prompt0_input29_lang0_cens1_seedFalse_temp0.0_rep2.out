To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and samples were taken from different parts of the prostate (e.g., left lower, right lower, etc.). It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that multiple samples were taken from different locations within the prostate, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), as those procedures have different characteristics not directly mentioned.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "non-prostatic tissue is observed" in samples A and C, suggesting contamination, and mentions that certain assessments (capsule penetration, perineural invasion, differentiation stages of tumor cells) could not be made due to issues with samples A and C. It implies there was an interest in assessing "potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure" which are features that could be associated with malignancy. However, it does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The fact that a "Score sum determination was not possible" and samples were to be "re-examined" suggests there was some concern or suspicion, but it doesn't directly confirm malignancy. Despite this, the context implies that malignancy was being investigated.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," which directly relates to the Gleason score. The Gleason score is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on how much the tumor tissue looks like normal prostate tissue under a microscope. The inability to determine the score sum implies that either the samples were not suitable for this assessment or the tumor was not definitively identified or graded.

Given these observations:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, the most likely answer is "biopsy."
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, despite the context suggesting an investigation into potential malignancy, the statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, it might be considered "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement on malignancy.
- For the **Reported Gleason Grade**, since the statement says "Score sum determination was not possible," it implies that the Gleason grade could not be determined, so it should be considered "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses issues and concerns that imply a potential malignancy was being considered) and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "reportedGleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified format and provides answers based on the information given in the statement.
