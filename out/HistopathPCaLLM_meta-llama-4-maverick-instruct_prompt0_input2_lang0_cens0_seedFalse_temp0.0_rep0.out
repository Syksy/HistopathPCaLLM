To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement describes the sample as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" but later clarifies that "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." This indicates a discrepancy between the initial description and the later clarification. However, for the purpose of determining the original sample type based on the information given:
   - The initial description suggests it is a prostatectomy specimen, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
   - The later clarification indicates it's an autopsy sample. "Autopsy" is not among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsy" doesn't fit the predefined categories and the statement initially describes it as a prostatectomy specimen, we might consider "RP" as the closest relevant sample type related to prostate tissue. However, given the context that it's actually an autopsy, the most accurate answer based on the allowed values would be "NA" because it doesn't directly fit into the categories provided.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes that "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It also mentions that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and that "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the prostate tissue is benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grading, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no severe lesion is present).
