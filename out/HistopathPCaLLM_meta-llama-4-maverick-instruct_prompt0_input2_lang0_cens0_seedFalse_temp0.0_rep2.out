To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement describes the sample as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" but later clarifies that "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." This indicates a potential discrepancy between the initial description and the later clarification. However, for the purpose of determining the original sample type based on the information given, we should consider what is directly stated about the original sample. The statement directly calls it an "autopsy sample," which is not among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsy" is not listed among the allowed values and "prostatectomy" is mentioned (which could be related to "RP" - Radical Prostatectomy), we need to decide based on the closest match or the context. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure and matches the initial description of a "prostatectomy specimen." Therefore, the closest allowed value is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes that the prostate tissue contains "at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It also mentions that the resection surfaces are clean, the capsule shows no abnormal growth, and seminal vesicles appear to contain no tumor growth. This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there were no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure the data in valid JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
