To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement describes the sample as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" but later clarifies that "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." This indicates a discrepancy between the initial description and the later clarification. However, for the purpose of determining the original sample type based on the information given:
   - The initial description suggests it is a prostatectomy specimen, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
   - The later clarification indicates it's an autopsy sample. "Autopsy" is not among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsy" doesn't directly map to the given options and the primary description is of a prostatectomy specimen, we will consider "RP" as the most appropriate choice given the allowed values.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and concludes with "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, it emphasizes benign growth and the absence of tumor growth in the seminal vesicles and at the resection surfaces. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
