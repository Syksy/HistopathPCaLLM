To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. However, it's also described as an "autopsy sample," which is a sample taken after death, not typically what is meant by "prostatectomy specimen" in clinical contexts. Despite this confusion, the closest match from the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA") for a prostatectomy specimen is "RP". However, given the context that it's described as an autopsy sample, none of the provided options directly match. For the purpose of this task, we'll have to choose the closest or most relevant answer based on the information given.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes with "SUMMARY: Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It mentions "normal benign growth," "atrophy," "spot-like inflammation," and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia" but does not indicate any malignant findings. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Let's structure the data according to the given instructions:

- The sample is referred to as a prostatectomy specimen, which aligns most closely with "RP". However, it's worth noting the inconsistency with it being called an autopsy sample. For the purpose of this task, we'll select "RP" as it's the closest clinical match, despite the confusion.
- Malignant tumor findings are "no".
- The Gleason grade is "NA" due to the absence of malignant findings.

Here's the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the task's requirements by providing a flat structure with the required information derived from the most severe lesion (or the overall assessment in this case, as there's no indication of malignancy).
