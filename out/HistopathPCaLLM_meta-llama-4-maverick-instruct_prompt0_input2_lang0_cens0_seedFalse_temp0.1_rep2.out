To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement describes the sample as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" but later clarifies that "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." This indicates a discrepancy between the initial description and the later clarification. However, for the purpose of determining the original sample type based on the information given:
   - The initial description suggests it is a prostatectomy specimen, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
   - The later clarification indicates it's an autopsy sample. "Autopsy" is not among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsy" doesn't fit the predefined categories and the statement initially describes it as a prostatectomy specimen, we will consider "RP" as the most relevant choice given the options.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes with "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It mentions "normal benign growth," "atrophy," "spot-like inflammation," and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia" but does not indicate any malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure the information in valid JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
