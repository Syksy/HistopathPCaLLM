To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The allowed values for the original sample type are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match the specified surgical or diagnostic procedures.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "Further findings cannot be reliably inferred, due to inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples" and that the samples "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies that there is some suspicion or potential for malignancy (adenocarcinoma) but it's not conclusively determined due to the condition of the samples. However, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the statement doesn't conclusively confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings and the condition of the sample hinders a definitive assessment, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of a clear diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it mentions that the samples are not in a condition to reliably characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no reported malignancy that would be graded.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly support identifying different lesions or their severity), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
