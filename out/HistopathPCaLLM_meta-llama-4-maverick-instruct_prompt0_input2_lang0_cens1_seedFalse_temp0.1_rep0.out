To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The allowed values for the original sample type are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match the specified clinical sample types.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies that there is a possibility of malignant changes, but it's not conclusively determined. However, the presence of "potential adenocarcinoma" suggests that malignant tumor findings are possible or suspected but not definitively identified. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Given that the statement does not conclusively confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings but suggests potential, the most conservative interpretation based on the information given would lean towards "NA" due to the uncertainty and the fact that further inspection is required.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma (a type of prostate cancer) but does not confirm its presence or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, since there's no reported Gleason grade due to the inconclusive nature of the findings, the answer would be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses the challenges in assessing the sample) would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the analysis based on the provided statement and adheres to the specified format and allowed values.
