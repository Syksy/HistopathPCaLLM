To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The allowed values for the original sample type are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match the specified clinical sample types.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "Further findings cannot be reliably inferred, due to inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples" and that the samples "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant tumor findings. However, the presence of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" is mentioned, suggesting that there is some suspicion or indication of malignancy, but it's not conclusively identified. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Given the uncertainty and the fact that the sample is not conclusively diagnosed as malignant due to the limitations mentioned, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm or rule out malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer findings in the format of "major+minor=sum". The statement does not provide a definitive Gleason grade due to the limitations in assessing the sample. It mentions "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but does not confirm malignancy or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as the sample is not conclusively diagnosed as malignant.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly identify multiple lesions or their severity) would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (or the information available, which in this case is not conclusive).
