To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The allowed values for the original sample type are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into any of the specific categories like "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match the given categories.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue that do exhibit inflammatory and age-related changes." This implies that there are potential malignant changes, but they are not conclusively identified due to the condition of the samples. However, the presence of "potential adenocarcinoma" suggests that malignant tumor findings are suspected but not definitively confirmed. For the purpose of this task and given the allowed values ("yes", "no", or "NA"), since the findings are not conclusive, the most appropriate response would be "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma but does not confirm it or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score is provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses the challenges in assessing the sample), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (or the overall assessment in this case, as specific comparisons are not made).
