To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips or fragments. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement confirms the presence of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," indicating that there were indeed malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The text states that the "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." For Gleason grading, the primary and secondary patterns are typically used to give a score (e.g., 4+3). The mention of a "tertiary pattern grade 5" suggests a more complex grading but doesn't directly alter the basic Gleason score format. The original diagnosis was "3+3," which was updated. The updated Gleason score based on the most significant patterns is "4+3." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three required structured fields based on the provided histopathological statement.
