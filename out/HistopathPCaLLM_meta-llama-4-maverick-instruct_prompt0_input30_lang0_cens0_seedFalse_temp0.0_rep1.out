To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) because it involves chippings, which is a characteristic of TURP procedures.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement confirms the presence of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," indicating that there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the primary pattern is grade 4, the secondary pattern is grade 3, and there's a tertiary pattern grade 5. For Gleason grading, the score is typically represented by the sum of the two most prevalent patterns. Even though a tertiary pattern is mentioned (grade 5), the primary and secondary patterns are 4 and 3, respectively. Thus, the Gleason score is calculated as 4+3=7.

Given these observations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three required fields based on the provided histopathological statement.
