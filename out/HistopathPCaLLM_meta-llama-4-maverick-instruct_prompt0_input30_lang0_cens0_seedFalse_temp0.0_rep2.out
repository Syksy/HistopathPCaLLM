To structure the given free format text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips or fragments. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement confirms the presence of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," indicating that there were indeed malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The text states that the "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5." However, for the Gleason score, the tertiary pattern is not typically included in the score but is mentioned for its prognostic value. The primary and secondary patterns are used to calculate the Gleason score. The statement also directly mentions that the diagnosis was updated and refers to a Gleason score of "3+3" being revised. Later, it specifies the Gleason score as having a "major pattern" of grade 4 and a "secondary pattern" of grade 3. Therefore, the Gleason score is "4+3=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
