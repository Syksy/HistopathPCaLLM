To structure the given text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The text mentions "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" which implies that the sample or the case is being re-evaluated. It doesn't directly state the original sample type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication of it being a "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), the value for the sample type should be considered as "NA" due to lack of information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement discusses "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but concludes that the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions." This implies uncertainty regarding the malignancy. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, and the statement doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Given that there's no information about the Gleason grade and the statement doesn't confirm malignancy, the answer should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given free format text, adhering to the specified requirements and allowed values.
