To structure the given text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The text mentions "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" which implies that the sample is related to a consultation or a secondary examination rather than the original sample collection method. However, it does not directly state the original sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we can consider it as "NA" since the specific original sample type isn't mentioned.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement discusses "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but concludes that the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions." This indicates uncertainty regarding the malignancy. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, and the statement leans towards uncertainty rather than a definitive diagnosis, we should consider this as "NA" due to the lack of a clear "yes" or "no" answer.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The discussion revolves around uncertainty and the inability to confirm or deny atypical findings, not providing a Gleason score. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the text doesn't directly discuss lesions or their severity, it implies a lack of conclusive diagnosis) would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (in this case, there's no clear information on lesions or their severity).
