To structure the given text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The text mentions "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" which implies it's a consultation on a previously obtained sample. However, it doesn't directly state the type of sample. Since it doesn't explicitly mention "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context is not clearly related to any of these, the sample type is not directly inferable. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it is not specified.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement discusses "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but concludes that the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions." This implies uncertainty regarding the malignancy. Since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement is about an uncertain diagnosis that could not be resolved, and there's no reference to a Gleason score. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it's related to a case where malignancy was not confirmed.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given free-form text, adhering to the specified requirements and allowed values.
