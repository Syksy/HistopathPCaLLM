To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient had undergone routine systematic biopsy," which indicates the original sample type is "biopsy." Although subsequent biopsies were mentioned, the question pertains to the "original sample type." Hence, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that there were malignant tumor findings, as it mentions "a minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6" and later a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4." Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement initially reports a Gleason grade of "3+3=6" from the first biopsy. However, it later mentions a more severe finding from a subsequent targeted biopsy, indicating a primary differentiation pattern of "4" and a secondary pattern of "5." Thus, the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9." Since the task is to report based on the most severe lesion, "4+5=9" is the appropriate Gleason grade.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements:
- It identifies the "originalSampleType" as "biopsy."
- Confirms "malignantTumorFindings" as "yes."
- Reports the "gleasonGrade" based on the most severe lesion as "4+5=9."
