To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient had undergone routine systematic biopsy," which indicates the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement clearly indicates that there were malignant tumor findings. It mentions a "minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6" and later a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4." Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement initially reports a Gleason grade of "3+3=6" from the systematic biopsy. However, it later mentions a "primary differentiation pattern 4" and suggests the second most common pattern is "5" from the second targeted biopsy. This implies a Gleason grade of "4+5=9" for the most severe lesion.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion (which is from the second targeted biopsy), we can now structure the data as requested.

- **Original Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "yes"
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "4+5=9"

Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion identified in the statement.
