To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" after imaging due to suspicious symptoms. It also refers to a "first sample" and "other samples." However, it does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Given the context, it is plausible that the samples were biopsies, as they were taken due to suspicious symptoms and after imaging. There's no clear indication that it was RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the most likely sample type based on the context is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "suspicious findings" in the samples, but it does not confirm malignancy. It mentions that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult" and that additional samples were needed. This implies that while there were suspicious findings, they were not conclusively malignant. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively "yes." Given the uncertainty, the answer could lean towards "NA" because the statement does not conclusively state that the findings were malignant.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement discusses suspicious findings but does not provide a Gleason score, which is typically associated with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade would be "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's characteristics (though in this case, malignancy was not confirmed).
- Not using nested structures.
- Using the allowed values for each field ("biopsy" for sample type, "NA" for both malignant findings and Gleason grade due to lack of conclusive evidence or information).
