To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" after imaging due to suspicious symptoms. It also refers to a "first sample" and "other samples." However, it does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Given the context, it seems most likely that the samples are biopsies because they were taken due to suspicious symptoms and after imaging, which is a common procedure for diagnosing prostate issues. However, the exact type is not specified, and "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are typically done for different clinical reasons. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, we'll have to choose "NA" (Not Available) as the sample type is not clearly identified.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "suspicious findings" in the samples, but it does not confirm malignancy. It mentions that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult" and that "additional samples and treatment planning needed." This implies that while there are suspicious findings, there is no clear confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings. The most appropriate answer would be "NA" because the statement does not conclusively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its mention is typically associated with a confirmed or suspected malignancy. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide a Gleason grade, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" when the information is not available or not applicable.
