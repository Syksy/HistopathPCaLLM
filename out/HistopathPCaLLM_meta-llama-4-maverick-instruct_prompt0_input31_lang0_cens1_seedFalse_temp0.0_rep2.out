To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" and refers to a "first sample" and "other samples." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples were taken due to suspicious symptoms and after imaging, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it was "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the most likely sample type based on the information provided is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "suspicious findings" in the samples, but it does not confirm malignancy. It mentions that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult" and that "additional samples and treatment planning needed." This implies uncertainty regarding the malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings. The statement does not categorically rule out malignancy either, but given the context, the most appropriate answer based on the information provided would be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement discusses "suspicious findings" but does not provide a Gleason score or confirm the presence of cancer. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's results (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses the overall findings).
- Not using nested structures.
- Using the allowed values for each field.
