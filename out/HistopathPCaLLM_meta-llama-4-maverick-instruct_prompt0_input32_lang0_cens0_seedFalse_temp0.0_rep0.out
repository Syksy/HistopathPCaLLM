To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Therefore, the original sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In the original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason 4+4 pattern was observed..." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides various Gleason patterns observed: "Gleason 4+4 pattern was observed particularly in the base of the prostate, along with 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3 patterns." The most severe lesion is typically considered the one with the highest Gleason score or the most aggressive pattern. Here, the highest Gleason score mentioned is 4+4. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sampleType`: "RP"
- `malignantFindings`: "yes"
- `gleasonGrade`: "4+4=8"
