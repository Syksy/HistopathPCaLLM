To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Therefore, the original sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In the original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason 4+4 pattern was observed..." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions multiple Gleason patterns: "3+3, 3+4, 4+3, and particularly Gleason 4+4 pattern." The most severe lesion is associated with the highest Gleason score or the most aggressive pattern mentioned. Here, the most severe pattern is "4+4." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8."

Now, let's structure the data in valid JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion and avoiding nested structures.
