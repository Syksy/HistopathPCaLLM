To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "the original primary prostate tissue" and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined. The presence of seminal vesicles typically indicates a more extensive surgical specimen. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which involves the removal of the prostate gland along with seminal vesicles and sometimes lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the mention of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, we can infer that the sample is likely from a "RP". However, the text does not explicitly state this, and other possibilities are not directly ruled out based on the given information alone.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement does not directly confirm the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "The examination results are different from one sample to other" but does not specify the nature of these findings. It does state that "the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear," which typically implies no malignancy found in these specific tissues. However, it does not directly answer whether there were malignant findings in the prostate tissue itself.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used to grade prostate cancer based on its aggressiveness. The absence of any mention of Gleason grade or cancer diagnosis makes it impossible to determine the Gleason grade from this statement.

Given the information and the constraints:

- For the sample type, we have to choose the most likely based on the context. Since it mentions seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, "RP" is a reasonable inference, but it's not a direct statement.
- For malignant findings, the statement is ambiguous regarding the prostate tissue itself but indicates the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear.
- For Gleason grade, there's no information provided.

Therefore, based on the given instructions and the text:

1. **Original Sample Type**: "RP" (inferred based on the context, though not directly stated).
2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "NA" (since the statement doesn't directly confirm or deny malignancy in the prostate tissue).
3. **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since there's no mention of cancer or Gleason grading).

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the task's requirements by providing a structured answer in JSON format without nested structures, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly support detailed analysis), and using the allowed values for each field.
