To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "the original primary prostate tissue" and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined. The presence of seminal vesicles typically indicates a more extensive surgical specimen. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which involves the removal of the prostate gland along with seminal vesicles and sometimes lymph nodes. Therefore, based on the mention of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, the sample type is likely "RP". If the information was not present or unclear, it would be "NA". So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement does not directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "The examination results are different from one sample to other" and that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles "were clear." The fact that lymph nodes were clear might imply a benign or localized condition, but it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the prostate tissue itself. Without a clear statement about malignancy, and given that it doesn't directly say "cancer" or "malignant tumor," we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of direct information. However, the context suggests a potentially benign or unclear scenario because it highlights that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, which is a positive prognostic sign. Still, the direct question about malignancy in the prostate tissue isn't answered. So, we have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a direct statement.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, indicating how much the tumor tissue differs from normal prostate tissue. Since there's no mention of the Gleason grade or any indication that the tissue was malignant, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given statement.
