To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "the original primary prostate tissue" and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being examined, which were clear. The mention of "original primary prostate tissue" could imply a radical prostatectomy (RP) since it involves the removal of the prostate along with seminal vesicles and sometimes lymph nodes. However, the text does not explicitly state the sample type. Therefore, we will have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement does not directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings in the prostate tissue itself. It only mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, which implies no metastasis to these areas but does not directly state the status of the prostate tissue. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignant findings based on the given information, so we will consider it as "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of prostate cancer based on the tumor's microscopic appearance. Since there's no mention of the Gleason score or any details that would suggest a malignant diagnosis, we will consider it as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the statement regarding the sample type, malignant tumor findings, and Gleason grade.
