To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample is from a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3" and "Tumor has penetrated the capsule," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides Gleason grades as "3+4/4+3." Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and given that both patterns are mentioned together, it suggests a mixed pattern. The higher grade is typically considered more severe, so "4+3=7" is more severe than "3+4=7." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+3=7."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion as per the given histopathological statement.
