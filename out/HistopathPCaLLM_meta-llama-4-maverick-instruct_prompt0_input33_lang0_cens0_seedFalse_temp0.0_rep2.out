To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate," which indicates that the sample is from a radical prostatectomy. Thus, the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and "One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes in processed macro sections." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3." This indicates that there are two Gleason scores mentioned, likely representing different areas or patterns within the tumor. For the purpose of this task, we will consider the most severe lesion. The scores given are 3+4 and 4+3, with the latter being considered more severe because it has a higher secondary grade. Thus, the Gleason score for the most severe lesion is "4+3=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+3=7".
