To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to "collected samples" and "processed samples" without specifying the type. Therefore, the sample type is not explicitly stated, leading to the conclusion that it is "NA" (Not Available or Not Specified).

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of malignancy is not definitively confirmed or denied for the overall sample, but there's an indication of possible abnormality. However, without a clear statement about malignant tumor findings in the prostate or the main specimen, and given the ambiguity, the most accurate interpretation based on the information given is "NA" because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the primary specimen.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the lack of a clear statement about malignancy, suggests that the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers for the most severe lesion (though the text does not directly support identifying a "most severe lesion"). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
