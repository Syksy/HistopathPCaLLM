To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since there's no explicit information about the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not directly confirm malignant findings. However, it explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not conclusive for malignancy. Since there's no definitive statement about malignant tumor findings in the provided text, and given the ambiguity, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy based on the information given.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, indicating how much the tumor tissue resembles normal prostate tissue. Since there's no mention of a Gleason grade or any specific details that would suggest a malignant tumor with a Gleason score, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the original statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
