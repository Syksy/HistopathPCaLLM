To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since there's no explicit information about the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not directly confirm malignant findings. However, it explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not conclusive for malignancy. Since there's no definitive statement about malignant tumor findings in the provided text, and given the ambiguity, the most appropriate answer based on the information directly related to malignancy ("No malignant findings in seminal vehicles") is not directly applicable to the overall sample. However, the statement does not conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings either. Therefore, the answer leans towards "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy in the sample as a whole.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, and its reporting is typically associated with malignant findings. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grade, the answer for this is "NA".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though the text does not directly support identifying a "most severe lesion"). The answers are based on the information available in the statement.
