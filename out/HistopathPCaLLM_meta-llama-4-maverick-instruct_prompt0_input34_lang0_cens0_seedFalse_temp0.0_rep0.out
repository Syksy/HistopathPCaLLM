To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr..." which indicates the sample is from a surgical resection. Given the context of prostate tissue and the mention of a significant weight (7.5gr), it is likely referring to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or possibly a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). However, the weight is relatively low for a typical RP, and TURP is a more plausible scenario given the weight and the fact that it's prepared into six tissue cassettes. TURP is a procedure often used to alleviate urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and further states "but no malignities." This confirms that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign (no malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and in the absence of cancer, it is not reported.

Based on the analysis:
- The sample type is most likely "TURP" due to the context and the weight of the sample.
- There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample was benign.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields as per the instructions.
