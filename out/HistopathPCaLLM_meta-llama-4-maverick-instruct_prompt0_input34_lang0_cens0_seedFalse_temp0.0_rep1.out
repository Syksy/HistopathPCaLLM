To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr..." which indicates the sample is from a surgical resection. Given the context of prostate tissue and the mention of "Hyperplastic prostate tissue," it is reasonable to infer that the resection is related to the prostate. The options provided are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA". Since the sample is described as a "resection" and not specifically as a "biopsy," and given that it's not explicitly mentioned as "RP," but is related to prostate tissue, we need to decide between "TURP" and "RP." The weight of the sample (7.5gr) and the fact that it's been prepared into six tissue cassettes could be consistent with either, but "TURP" is more commonly associated with a specimen that might be described in this manner and is typically smaller than an RP. However, without explicit mention of the procedure, the most likely surgical resections are "RP" or "TURP." The description doesn't directly indicate "TURP," but given the context, "RP" seems plausible. However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated, making "RP" a reasonable guess based on the context that it's a resection.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma... but no malignities." Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign ("no malignities"), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief justification for the chosen values:
- **sample_type**: "RP" is chosen as it is a resection and likely refers to a radical prostatectomy, although "TURP" could also be considered based on different interpretations.
- **malignant_findings**: "no" because the statement explicitly says there's no malignancy.
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" because there's no malignancy found, making Gleason grading not applicable.

Let's apply this understanding to provide the structured output. 

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
