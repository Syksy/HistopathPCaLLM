To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr..." which indicates the sample is from a surgical resection. Given the context of prostate tissue and the mention of a significant weight (7.5gr), it is likely referring to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or possibly a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). However, the weight is relatively low for a typical RP, and TURP is a more plausible scenario given the weight and the fact that it's prepared into six tissue cassettes. TURP is a procedure often used to alleviate urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and "but no malignities." This confirms that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign (no malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

**Rationale for choices:**
- **sample_type**: "TURP" is chosen based on the context and the weight of the sample, which is more typical for a TURP.
- **malignant_findings**: "no" because the statement explicitly states there are no malignancies.
- **gleason_grade**: "NA" since the sample was benign, and Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tissues.
