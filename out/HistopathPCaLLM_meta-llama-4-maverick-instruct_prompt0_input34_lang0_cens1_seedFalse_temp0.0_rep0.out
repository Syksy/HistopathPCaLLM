To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr." This information doesn't directly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). However, given the context and the weight of the sample, it is more likely to be a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight (7.5gr) is relatively significant for a biopsy, and the fact that it's been prepared into six tissue cassettes suggests a more substantial sample. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) specimens can vary in weight but are typically larger. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens are also possible and can be of varying weights. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" due to the sample size and processing. Without explicit mention, we must infer. Given the context, "RP" or "TURP" are possibilities, but "TURP" is more likely due to the mention of "Hyperplastic prostate tissue," which is often associated with TURP procedures. However, the exact nature isn't clearly stated, so we need to be cautious.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes histological findings that include glands being very close to each other and partial cribriform structures. Cribriform structures can be associated with malignancy, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. However, the statement explicitly says "Findings do not indicate prostatic" malignancy isn't directly stated as present or absent regarding the cribriform structures, but later it mentions "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen," indicating the sample is benign.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen," indicating a benign condition, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Thus, it should be "NA" as there's no malignancy reported.

Given these observations:

- The sample type is not directly stated, but based on the context, it could be inferred as "TURP" due to the weight and the mention of hyperplastic prostate tissue. However, without a clear indication, the safest choice might be "NA" if we strictly follow the given information.
- Malignant tumor findings are "no" since the statement concludes with a benign diagnosis.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample is benign.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign), is:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

However, if we were to be more conservative with the sample type due to the lack of explicit information:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

For the purpose of this task and based on the given instructions and the context provided, the more conservative answer is chosen:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```
