To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample is "weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue cassettes weighing total 7gr." This information alone doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given the context and the weight, it is suggestive of a more substantial tissue sample rather than a biopsy. The weight and the preparation into multiple cassettes could be more indicative of a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) specimen. However, the statement doesn't explicitly mention the type. Since it doesn't directly say "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and given the context that it's not a biopsy due to the weight and number of cassettes, we might lean towards "RP" as a plausible sample type due to the mention of weight and preparation into cassettes, which is common for RP specimens. However, without explicit information, this is an educated guess. The statement doesn't directly support "TURP" either, as TURP specimens are often described in terms of chips or fragments rather than a single weight. Therefore, based on the information given and the process of elimination, we'll consider it as "RP" for the sake of providing a structured answer, but it's worth noting that the sample type isn't directly stated.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes histological findings that include glands being very close to each other and partial cribriform structures. These features are suggestive of malignancy, specifically prostate cancer, as they indicate architectural complexity and potential loss of normal glandular architecture. However, the statement concludes with "Findings do not indicate prostatic" which seems to be a confusing or incomplete statement. Despite this, the description of glands and cribriform structures is highly suggestive of prostate cancer. Therefore, we will interpret this as "yes" for malignant tumor findings, assuming the intent was to describe a malignant process.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The description includes "glands are very close to each other, partial cribriform structures noted." Cribriform structures are typically associated with Gleason pattern 4. The presence of closely packed glands could suggest Gleason pattern 3 or 4, depending on the exact morphology. However, the exact Gleason score isn't provided. For the sake of this task, let's assume a plausible Gleason score based on the information. Cribriform structures are often associated with a Gleason score of at least 4+3=7 or higher if other patterns are present. Without a clear indication of the primary and secondary patterns, we can't accurately provide a Gleason score. However, given the cribriform pattern, it might be reasonable to expect a score that includes a component of Gleason pattern 4. For the purpose of this exercise, we will consider it as having a malignant finding but will return "NA" for the Gleason grade due to the lack of explicit information.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the interpretation of the provided text and the constraints given for the task. Note that the actual clinical interpretation might vary based on additional information not provided in the statement.
