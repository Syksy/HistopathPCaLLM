To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample is "weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue cassettes weighing total 7gr." This information alone doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given the context and the weight, it is suggestive of a significant tissue sample. The term "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is often associated with larger samples, and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) can also involve significant tissue. However, the specific details here (weight and preparation into cassettes) are more indicative of a "RP" specimen. "Biopsy" typically involves much smaller samples. Therefore, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes histological findings that include glands being very close to each other and partial cribriform structures. However, it explicitly states that "Findings do not indicate prostatic" malignancy is not directly stated but it implies the absence of prostatic cancer. It then mentions "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen," which further supports a benign condition. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the findings are benign (as indicated by the absence of prostatic cancer indication and the presence of hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
