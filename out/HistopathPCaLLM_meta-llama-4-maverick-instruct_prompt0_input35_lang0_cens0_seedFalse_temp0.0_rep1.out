To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma," indicating there are no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings ("No signs of carcinoma"), the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tumors.

Let's address each of the required fields based on the analysis:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" because the statement refers to "prostate biopsies."
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample is benign.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured information based on the histopathological statement.
