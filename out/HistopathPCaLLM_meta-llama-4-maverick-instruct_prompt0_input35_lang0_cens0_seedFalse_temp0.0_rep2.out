To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of carcinoma," indicating there are no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings ("No signs of carcinoma"), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA".

Let's address each point with the information given:

1. The sample type is "biopsy" because the statement refers to "prostate biopsies."
2. Malignant tumor findings are "no" since the statement concludes with "No signs of carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample is benign (no carcinoma found).

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the given histopathological statement.
