To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context that it mentions "left and right lobe" and describes specific histological findings, we can infer it's likely a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly stated and could be interpreted in different ways, and given that "lobe" can refer to prostate lobes which are often sampled in biopsies, the most likely sample type is "biopsy". However, without explicit confirmation, this is an inference.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "small high-grade PIN-changes" and "some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia." High-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous lesion but is not cancer. Hyperplasia refers to benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is also not malignant. There's no mention of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. The statement does not mention cancer or a Gleason grade, which is consistent with the absence of reported malignant findings. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement is describing a benign condition.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described (or lack thereof) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
