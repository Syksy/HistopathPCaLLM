To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context that it mentions "left and right lobe" and describes specific histological findings, we can infer it's likely a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly stated and could be interpreted in different ways, and given that "lobe" could refer to prostate lobes which are often sampled in biopsies, the most likely sample type is "biopsy". Thus, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "small high-grade PIN-changes" and "some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia." High-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous lesion but is not cancer. Hyperplasia refers to benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is also not malignant. There's no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a system used to grade prostate cancer based on how much the tumor tissue looks like normal prostate tissue under a microscope. The statement does not mention a diagnosis of cancer or a Gleason score. Since there's no malignant finding reported, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format, we get:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (or lack thereof) described in the histopathological statement.
