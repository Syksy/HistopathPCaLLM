To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." The size and weight suggest a significant sample, and the preparation of multiple cassettes indicates a substantial tissue sample. The term "RP" typically refers to Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical procedure that involves removing the prostate gland. The size and the detailed macroscopic and microscopic examination are consistent with a prostatectomy specimen rather than a biopsy. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another procedure that involves removing prostate tissue, but it is usually done in smaller fragments. The description does not directly indicate "TURP," and the size suggests a more intact specimen. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "No signs of malignity," it indicates the sample is benign. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer should be "NA."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as required, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
