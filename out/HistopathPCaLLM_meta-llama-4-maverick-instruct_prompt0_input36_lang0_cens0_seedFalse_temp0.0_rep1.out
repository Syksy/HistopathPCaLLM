To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." The size and weight suggest a significant sample, and the preparation of multiple cassettes indicates a substantial tissue sample. The description does not directly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the size (7 x 6 x 5 cm) and weight (80gr), it is likely not a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) specimens can be this large, but TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens can also be substantial. However, the description more aligns with an RP due to the size and the detailed macroscopic and microscopic examination. Yet, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support "TURP" or "biopsy" due to the size and detail. Therefore, based on the context, "RP" seems plausible, but it's not definitive.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "No signs of malignity," it implies the sample is benign. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "RP" is chosen here based on the size and detail of the specimen, the exact sample type isn't explicitly stated in the text. A more conservative approach without assuming the sample type would result in:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This version reflects the information directly available from the statement.
