To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about preparing "8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes," which is a process often associated with biopsies or surgical specimens. There's no clear indication of it being a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Given the lack of specific information, the most likely sample type isn't directly inferable, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to insufficient information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the condition "was not assessed reliably," but there's no mention of cancer or malignancy. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer is "no" because there's no indication of malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there were no malignant tumor findings reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
