To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." Electrosection chippings are typically associated with Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the histological examination revealing "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and mentions "minor inflammation in typical places" and that "findings indicate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate any malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as required, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign and thus doesn't have a Gleason score) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
