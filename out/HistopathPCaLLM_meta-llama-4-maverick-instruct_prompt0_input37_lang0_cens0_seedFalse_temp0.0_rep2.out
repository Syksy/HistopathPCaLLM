To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." Electrosection chippings are typically associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "Findings indicate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, it mentions "Minor inflammation in typical places" and "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components," which suggests a benign condition. Thus, the malignant tumor findings are "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the findings are benign (indicating hyperplasia and not malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement.
