To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "sample material preparated" and mentions "prostate tissue," which is common in biopsies or TURP. Without explicit information, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given text. Therefore, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The description doesn't directly indicate cancer; hence, we can't conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. The statement doesn't rule out malignancy explicitly either, but given the context, it seems to lean towards a benign or non-conclusive finding. However, the most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" or "no" due to the lack of a clear indication of malignancy. Since it doesn't directly state the presence of cancer and further examination is planned, we'll consider it as "no" for the purpose of this task, understanding that it's not a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned, and since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
