To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "sample material preparated" and "prostate tissue," which could be related to any of these procedures. Without specific information indicating it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context that it's a histological examination, we can't definitively categorize it into one of the given categories based on the information provided. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the prostate tissue with "partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly mention malignant tumor findings. The description does not directly indicate cancer, and there's no clear indication of malignancy. Thus, based on the information given, the answer would be "no" since there's no mention of malignant findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer. Since the statement does not indicate the presence of cancer (malignant tumor findings), the Gleason grade is not relevant or provided. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as it's related to a benign or non-malignant condition.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
