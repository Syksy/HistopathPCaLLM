To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "sample material preparated" and mentions "prostate tissue," which is common in biopsies or TURP. Without explicit information, we can't directly infer the sample type, so we'll have to consider the context and available information. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP. Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but doesn't explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The description doesn't directly indicate cancer; hence, we can't conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. The statement doesn't clearly rule out cancer either, but given the lack of a direct statement about malignancy, and considering the context that it doesn't seem to be a conclusive malignant diagnosis, we will lean towards "NA" or "no" based on the absence of a clear indication of malignancy. Since it doesn't directly say "no" but implies a non-conclusive or possibly benign condition due to the lack of further specification towards malignancy, we'll consider it "no" for the sake of providing a structured answer, understanding that the examination was not conclusive.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement doesn't confirm malignancy, so it doesn't provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it's related to malignant cases.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON provides the structured answers based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there's no clear indication of a malignant lesion).
