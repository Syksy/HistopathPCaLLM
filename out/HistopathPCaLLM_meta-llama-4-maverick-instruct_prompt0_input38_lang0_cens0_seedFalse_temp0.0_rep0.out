To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample was obtained through a biopsy procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes with "No suspected malignity." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates "No suspected malignity" and describes the tissue as "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation", it is a benign finding. For benign statements, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there are no malignant findings to grade).
