To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA" since we cannot determine the sample type from the given information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor cells. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate the presence of malignant cells, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data for the given histopathological statement, adhering to the specified requirements and allowed values.
