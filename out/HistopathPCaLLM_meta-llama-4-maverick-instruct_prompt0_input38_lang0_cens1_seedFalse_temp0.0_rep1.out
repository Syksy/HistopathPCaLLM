To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on common medical terminology, "Representative samples are collected" could imply a biopsy. But without explicit mention, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor cells. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer (a malignant condition) to assess the aggressiveness of the tumor based on the tumor's microscopic appearance. Since the statement indicates the presence of hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation and does not mention cancer or malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as required, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not malignant) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
