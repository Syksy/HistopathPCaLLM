To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions "Representative samples are collected" and "Total measurements provided in millimeters," which could imply a biopsy or another sampling method but doesn't directly state it. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor cells. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer to assess the aggressiveness of the tumor based on the tumor's microscopic appearance. Since the statement does not indicate the presence of cancer (malignant tumor), but rather mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation," the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not malignant) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
