To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation," which indicates that the sample is from a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides the Gleason grade as "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7." This translates to a Gleason score where the major grade is 3, the minor grade is 4, and the sum is 7. So, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sampleType`: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
- `malignantFindings`: "yes" (Indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings)
- `gleasonGrade`: "3+4=7" (The reported Gleason grade in the format "major+minor=sum")
