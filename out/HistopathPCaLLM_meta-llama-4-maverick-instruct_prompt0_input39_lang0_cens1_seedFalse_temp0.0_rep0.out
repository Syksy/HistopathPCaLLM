To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). However, it talks about "some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine," which could imply a surgical specimen. But without specific keywords like "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context, it's not straightforward to determine the sample type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards any of the specific types, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to lack of information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant findings, stating "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This implies that the diagnosis is inconclusive. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because the presence of malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point," which directly implies that the Gleason grade (in the form of major+minor=sum) cannot be determined. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it is used for benign or inconclusive statements where Gleason scoring is not applicable or not provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly indicate malignancy or severity) would be:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the allowed values for each field.
