To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). However, it talks about "some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine," which could imply a surgical specimen. But without specific keywords like "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context, it's not straightforward to determine. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards any of the specific types, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to lack of information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant findings, stating "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This implies that the diagnosis is inconclusive. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because it's not definitively stated.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." This means there's no Gleason grade provided or assessable. For benign or inconclusive statements where Gleason score isn't applicable or assessable, "NA" is an appropriate response.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between lesions) or the overall assessment would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing "NA" for the fields where the information is either not available or not assessable based on the given statement.
