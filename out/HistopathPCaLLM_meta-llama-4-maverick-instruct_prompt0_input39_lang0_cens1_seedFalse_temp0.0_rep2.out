To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). However, it talks about "some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine," which implies a surgical specimen. Given the context and the options available, "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a plausible sample type because it involves removing tissue, and slices can be extracted from it. However, without explicit information, this is an educated guess. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or RP (Radical Prostatectomy). So, based on the process described, we'll tentatively consider it as "TURP" for the sake of providing an answer, but it's worth noting that the sample type isn't explicitly stated.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates uncertainty regarding whether there are "benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This means the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" to malignant findings. The most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement explicitly mentions it's "not clear" if there are malignant findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason score is mentioned as being unassessable at the point of the statement. This implies that due to the uncertainty or the nature of the sample/inspection, a Gleason score could not be determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because it's not provided or assessable.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity is unclear), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields. Note that the interpretation of "sample_type" as "TURP" is based on the context and might not be definitive due to the lack of explicit information in the statement.
