To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample type because TURP typically involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Therefore, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that there is no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (in this case, there being no malignant lesion).
