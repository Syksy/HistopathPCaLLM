To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that there is no malignancy found, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no malignancy-related details are provided).
