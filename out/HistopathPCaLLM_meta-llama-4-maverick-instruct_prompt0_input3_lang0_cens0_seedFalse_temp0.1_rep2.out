To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which is indicative of a specific type of sample. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that there is no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as required, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there are no malignant findings).
