To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The term "prostate material" and the context suggest a significant amount of tissue was obtained, which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves the entire prostate gland and might not be described merely as "prostate material." Given the context, "TURP" seems the most likely sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This implies that due to the artefacts and lack of detailed examination, there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it doesn't explicitly state the tissue is benign or malignant. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignant cells and mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived," it implies that a Gleason grade cannot be determined. The Gleason grade is used for malignant prostate tissue.

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is likely "TURP" due to the amount of prostate material mentioned.
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively confirm or deny malignancy due to the limitations in examination.
- The reported Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no confirmation of malignancy.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```
