To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The term "prostate material" and the context suggest a significant amount of tissue was obtained, which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves the entire prostate gland and might not be described merely as "prostate material." Given the context, "TURP" seems the most likely sample type because it involves removing prostate tissue, and the amount can be substantial.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This implies that due to the artefacts and lack of detailed examination, there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it doesn't explicitly state the absence of malignancy either. Therefore, the findings are not conclusive for malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't provide a conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts and doesn't mention any specific Gleason grade, and given that there's no clear indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it's related to malignant assessments.

Based on the analysis:

- The sample type is likely "TURP" due to the amount of prostate material mentioned.
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively confirm or deny malignancy.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no conclusive malignant diagnosis.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the specified requirements and provides the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
