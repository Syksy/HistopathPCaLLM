To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The term "prostate material" and the context suggest a significant amount of tissue was obtained, which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves the entire prostate gland and might not be described merely as "prostate material." Given the context, "TURP" seems the most plausible sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This implies that due to the artefacts and lack of detailed examination, there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it doesn't explicitly state the absence of malignant findings either. The statement leans towards being inconclusive regarding malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings and mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived," it's reasonable to infer that a Gleason grade wasn't reported or determined.

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is likely "TURP" due to the amount of prostate material mentioned.
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement is inconclusive about the presence or absence of malignancy.
- The reported Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy and thus no Gleason grade was provided.

Here's the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the statement doesn't directly support identifying a lesion as malignant or its severity) and providing a flat, non-nested structure.
