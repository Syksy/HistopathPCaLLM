To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The term "prostate material" and the context suggest a significant amount of tissue was obtained, which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves the entire prostate gland and might not be described merely as "prostate material." Given the context, TURP seems the most likely.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." This implies that due to the artefacts and lack of detailed examination, there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it doesn't explicitly state the absence of malignancy either. Therefore, the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings is not conclusively determined.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence of malignancy due to artefacts and lack of detailed examination, it is unlikely to have a reported Gleason grade.

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is likely "TURP" due to the amount of prostate material mentioned.
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively confirm or deny malignancy.
- The reported Gleason grade is "NA" as there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy and thus no Gleason grading.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given histopathological statement.
