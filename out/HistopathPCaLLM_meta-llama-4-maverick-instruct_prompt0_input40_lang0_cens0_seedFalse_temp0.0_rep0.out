To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "shaving material" and that it was "set on eight casettes." This context suggests the sample is likely from a surgical procedure. The terms "shaving material" and the process of being set on cassettes are common in pathology for handling tissue samples. Given the context, "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a plausible sample type because it involves removing prostate tissue in a manner that could be described as "shaving." "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves removing the entire prostate gland, which doesn't directly align with the description of "shaving material." "Biopsy" is also possible but less likely given the quantity of tissue (8.9g) described. Therefore, based on the description, the most likely sample type is "TURP."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth." This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to this question is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "SUMMARY: Benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth," it indicates the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer should be "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as required, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no variation in severity).
