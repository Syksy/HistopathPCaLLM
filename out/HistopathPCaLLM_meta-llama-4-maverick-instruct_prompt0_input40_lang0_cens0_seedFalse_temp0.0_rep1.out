To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "shaving material" which is not directly indicative of the standard sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, "shaving material" can be associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue by shaving or cutting it away.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the findings were benign ("Benign prostate hyperplasia"), there is no Gleason grade reported. The Gleason grade is used for malignant tumors. Thus, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis:

- The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" based on the context.
- Malignant tumor findings are "no".
- The Gleason grade is "NA" due to the benign nature of the findings.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields as per the instructions.
