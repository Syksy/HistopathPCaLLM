To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "shaving material" which is not directly indicative of the standard sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, "shaving material" can be associated with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue by shaving or cutting it away.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth," indicating there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and mentions no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Thus, the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis:

- The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" based on the context.
- Malignant tumor findings are "no".
- The Gleason grade is "NA" due to the benign nature of the findings.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
