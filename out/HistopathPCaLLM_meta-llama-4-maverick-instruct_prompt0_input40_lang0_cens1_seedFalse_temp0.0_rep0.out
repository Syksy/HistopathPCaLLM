To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examined material weights 8.9, approx 8 casettes are used." This indicates that the material is being examined in a pathology lab, and the use of "casettes" suggests it's a specimen that has been processed. The weight and the number of cassettes used don't directly indicate the type of sample, but given the context, it is likely a significant specimen. The statement doesn't directly say "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), but the weight and the mention of multiple cassettes could be more indicative of a larger specimen like RP or TURP rather than a biopsy. However, without a clear indication, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't provide a clear indication of the sample type, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says "Histological examination reveals at least hyperplastic prostate and ...... At least inflammation, but possibly something else." The mention of "hyperplastic prostate" indicates a benign condition (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, BPH), and "inflammation" could refer to prostatitis. The phrase "but possibly something else" is vague and suggests uncertainty or the need for further evaluation but doesn't directly indicate malignancy. The statement concludes with "Further examination is needed," which implies that the diagnosis is not conclusive. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, we'll consider this as "NA" due to the uncertainty and the need for further examination.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used to grade prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue under the microscope. Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of cancer ("possibly something else" and "further examination is needed"), and instead mentions benign conditions like hyperplasia and inflammation, the Gleason grade is not applicable here. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, no malignancy was confirmed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
