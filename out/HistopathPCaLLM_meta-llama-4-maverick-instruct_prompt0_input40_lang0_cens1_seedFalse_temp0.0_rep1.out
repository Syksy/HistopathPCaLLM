To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examined material weights 8.9, approx 8 casettes are used." This indicates that the material is being examined in a pathology lab, and the use of "casettes" suggests it's a specimen that has been processed. The weight and the number of cassettes used could relate to various sample types, but without directly stating "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), we need to infer based on context. The weight (8.9, presumably grams) and the number of cassettes could be consistent with several types of prostate specimens. However, the statement does not directly indicate the sample type. Given the lack of specific information about the sample type and the fact that it's not directly stated, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to insufficient information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says "Histological examination reveals at least hyperplastic prostate and ...... At least inflammation, but possibly something else." The mention of "hyperplastic prostate" indicates a benign condition (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, BPH), and "inflammation" could refer to prostatitis. The phrase "possibly something else" is vague and does not directly indicate malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings and the statement leans more towards benign conditions with a vague suggestion of further examination being needed, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings would be "no" based on the information directly provided.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, grading it based on the tumor's microscopic appearance. Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer (malignant tumor findings) and instead focuses on benign conditions like hyperplasia and inflammation, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case doesn't indicate malignancy) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
