To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there are no malignant tumor findings (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format. The required fields are "sampleType", "malignantFindings", and "gleasonGrade".

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no cancer identified).
