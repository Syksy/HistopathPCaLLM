To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement concludes with "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer should be "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, since there's no cancer) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
