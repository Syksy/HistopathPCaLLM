To address the given task, let's analyze the provided histopathological statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions samples collected from "left and right lobes of prostate." This information alone doesn't directly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). However, given the context that multiple samples were taken from different lobes, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves the removal of the entire prostate gland, and Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) is usually performed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The description best fits a biopsy. So, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that there is uncertainty regarding cancer-related changes ("Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not"). This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings reported. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA" as it is a benign/uncertain statement.

Now, structuring the answers in valid JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
