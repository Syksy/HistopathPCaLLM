To address the given task, let's analyze the provided histopathological statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions samples collected from "left and right lobes of prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that multiple samples were taken from different lobes, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that there is uncertainty regarding "cancer related changes," suggesting that no definitive malignant tumor was identified. It mentions "little chronic inflammation" and "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation" but does not confirm the presence of cancer. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because the text does not confirm the presence of cancer.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and in the absence of a cancer diagnosis, it is not reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
