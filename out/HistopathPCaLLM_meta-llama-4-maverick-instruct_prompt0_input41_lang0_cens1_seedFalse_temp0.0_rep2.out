To address the given task, let's analyze the provided histopathological statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions samples collected from "left and right lobes of prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that multiple samples were taken from different lobes, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most likely sample type based on the information given is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that it is "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings reported. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not reported. Therefore, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade in this context is "NA" because it's a benign or inconclusive statement regarding malignancy.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case doesn't indicate cancer), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the histopathological statement.
