To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So, the original sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grades (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3), which are used to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. The presence of these grades indicates that there were malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason score with the major and minor components. It mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" as the predominant pattern and a "small amount of Gleason 3," summarizing the score as "7 (4+3)". Thus, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and avoiding nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three required fields based on the provided histopathological statement.
