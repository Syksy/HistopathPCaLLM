To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP," standing for Radical Prostatectomy.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grades, which are a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness. The mention of "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and "Gleason 3" indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason score with the major and minor components. It mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" as the predominant pattern, a "small amount of Gleason 3," and summarizes with "score 7 (4+3)." This indicates the Gleason score is 4+3=7, where 4 is the major grade, 3 is the minor grade, and 7 is the sum.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and without nested structures, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object answers the three required fields:
- The original sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".
