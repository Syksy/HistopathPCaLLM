To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP," standing for Radical Prostatectomy.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The presence of Gleason grades (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3) indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason score with the major and minor components and their sum. It is "4+3=7," indicating the major grade is 4, the minor is 3, and the sum is 7.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format, we get:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "RP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested:
- The original sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".
