To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on common medical terminology, a "prostate sample" is often associated with a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context that it's a sample, we can infer it is likely a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty about the presence of cancer, and it hasn't been confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings. Since it's not definitively benign or malignant, and there's uncertainty, the closest answer would be "NA" because we cannot confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer to assess the aggressiveness of the tumor. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, and it is uncertain whether the sample is malignant. Since the diagnosis is uncertain and not confirmed as cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it is not a confirmed malignant case.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the given histopathological statement.
