To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step and then provide the structured data in JSON format.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on common medical terminology, a "prostate sample" is often associated with a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context that it's a sample, we can infer it is likely a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty about the presence of cancer, and it hasn't been confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant tumor findings. The appropriate answer would be "NA" since the presence of cancer is uncertain and not definitively diagnosed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer to assess the aggressiveness of the tumor based on the tumor's microscopic appearance. Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer ("whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined"), the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Now, let's structure the data according to the given requirements in JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the presence of a malignant lesion is uncertain) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
