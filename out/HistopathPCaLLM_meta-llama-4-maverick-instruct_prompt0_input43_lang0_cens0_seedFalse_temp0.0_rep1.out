To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and "about 15g left in the jar." This context indicates that the sample was obtained through a procedure that involves removing or sampling prostate tissue, likely through a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) given the description of "chippings." Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there are "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma," it implies the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format gives:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no indication of multiple lesions with varying severity).
