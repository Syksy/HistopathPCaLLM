To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and "about 15g left in the jar." This context suggests that the sample was obtained through a procedure that involves removing or sampling prostate tissue in a fragmented manner. "Prostate chippings" is a term commonly associated with Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there are "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma," it implies the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
