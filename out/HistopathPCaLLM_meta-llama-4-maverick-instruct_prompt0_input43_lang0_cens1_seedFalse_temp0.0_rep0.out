To address the given task, let's analyze the provided histopathological statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples" and that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." The sample size and the fact that it's placed in cassettes and a jar doesn't directly indicate the type. However, a sample of approximately 30g is substantial and could be associated with a significant surgical specimen. The types mentioned are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available). Given the weight, it's likely not a biopsy, which is typically much smaller. TURP specimens can be substantial but are usually chipped or fragmented. A Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen can weigh around this amount. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." This indicates that there are no clear malignant findings reported. The presence of "atrophied glands" could be a non-specific finding or related to various benign conditions. The inability to decide on cancerous changes doesn't equate to a positive finding for malignancy. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and in this case, there's no cancer diagnosis. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the histopathological statement.
