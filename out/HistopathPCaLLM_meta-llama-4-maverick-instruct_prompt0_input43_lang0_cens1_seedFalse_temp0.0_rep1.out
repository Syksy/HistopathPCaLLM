To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples" and that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." The sample is from the prostate, and the context suggests a significant amount of tissue is being examined, which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight (30g) is substantial and more typical of a prostatectomy or a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen. However, the exact procedure (RP - Radical Prostatectomy or TURP) isn't directly stated. Given the context, it is less likely to be a biopsy due to the quantity of the sample. Between RP and TURP, the description doesn't directly indicate the nature of the surgery. However, the fact that it's a significant sample and the material is described in a way that suggests a more substantial resection, we might lean towards TURP or RP. The description doesn't directly support "biopsy" due to the quantity and handling of the sample. Since it's not explicitly stated and based on the given options, we'll have to make an educated guess. For the sake of this task, let's consider it as "TURP" due to the significant sample size and the fact that it's not explicitly a "RP." However, without more specific information, this is an interpretation.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says, "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." This indicates that there are no clear malignant findings reported. The pathologist is unable to make a decision regarding cancerous changes, implying that there is no definitive diagnosis of cancer. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings reported or implied, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA."

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case, doesn't indicate malignancy).
