To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples" and that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." The sample size and the fact that it's placed in cassettes and a jar doesn't directly indicate the type. However, a sample of approximately 30g is substantial and could be associated with a surgical specimen. The mention of "cassettes" is common in pathology for processing tissue, which could be from various sample types. The key here is understanding that "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves a larger sample, "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) can also involve a significant amount of tissue, and "biopsy" usually involves much smaller samples. Given the context, a "TURP" or "RP" seems plausible due to the quantity of tissue. However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy" and given the quantity, it might lean towards "TURP" or "RP". But without a clear indication, one might default to a more cautious interpretation.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." This indicates that there are no clear malignant findings reported. The presence of "atrophied glands" could be a benign change, and the inability to decide on cancerous changes suggests that there's no definitive malignancy identified.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignant tumor finding reported or Gleason grade assigned, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tissues.

Given these considerations:

- **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given the context, it could be considered as "TURP" due to the significant amount of tissue. However, without explicit information, one might consider it as "NA" for strict interpretation. For the purpose of this task and based on the quantity of tissue, let's consider it as "TURP".
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "no" because there's no clear indication of cancerous changes.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" because there's no malignancy reported.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
