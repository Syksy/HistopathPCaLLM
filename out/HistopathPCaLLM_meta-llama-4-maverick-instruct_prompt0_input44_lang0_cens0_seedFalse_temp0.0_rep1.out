To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the prostate tissue as "normally structured" and mentions "little chronic inflammation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious." It also summarizes that "earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." This implies there are no malignant tumor findings in the current sample. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
