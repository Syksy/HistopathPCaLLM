To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the prostate tissue as "normally structured" and mentions "little chronic inflamation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious." It also summarizes that "earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." This implies there were no malignant tumor findings in the current sample. Thus, the answer is "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings in the current biopsy, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported for this sample. Hence, it should be considered as "NA."

Now, let's structure the information in valid JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the given instructions, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) described in the histopathological statement.
