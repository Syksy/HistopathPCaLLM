To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" and later refers to "earlier biopsies." The current sample is not explicitly stated to be a biopsy, but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that it is a biopsy. However, the text does not directly state the sample type. Since it mentions "samples" and is discussing prostate tissue under microscope, and there's a mention of "earlier biopsies," we can infer that the current sample is likely a biopsy. Thus, the sample type can be considered as "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This implies that the current sample does not conclusively show malignant tumor findings. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the purpose of this sample, though, the finding is "NA" or inconclusive regarding malignancy because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the current sample. However, given the allowed values and the context that it's not directly stating "yes" or "no" for the current sample, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because it doesn't conclusively determine malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not report any malignancy in the current sample and instead refers to earlier biopsies having reported prostate cancer, the Gleason grade for this sample is not provided. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" because the current sample's malignancy status is not conclusively determined.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the current sample doesn't conclusively show malignancy) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
