To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" and later refers to "earlier biopsies." The current sample is not explicitly stated to be a biopsy, but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that it is a biopsy. However, the text does not directly state the sample type. Since it mentions "samples" and is discussing prostate tissue under microscope, and there's a mention of "earlier biopsies," we can infer it's likely a biopsy. Thus, the sample type can be considered as "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This implies that the current sample does not conclusively show malignant tumor findings. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the current sample, since it doesn't conclusively show malignancy, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because it directly states that nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes in the current sample, implying the absence of conclusive evidence of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for the current sample, and since it doesn't confirm malignancy, it doesn't provide a Gleason score. The Gleason grade is related to malignant findings, and since the current sample doesn't show conclusive malignant changes, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the sample doesn't conclusively show malignancy) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
