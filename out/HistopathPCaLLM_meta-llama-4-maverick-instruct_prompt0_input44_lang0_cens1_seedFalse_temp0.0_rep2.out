To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine" and later refers to "earlier biopsies." The current sample is not explicitly stated to be a biopsy, but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that it is a biopsy. The statement does not explicitly mention "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, based on the information provided and the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the prostate tissue as "normally structured" with some benign changes (chronic inflammation and atrophy) and explicitly states, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not show clear evidence of malignancy. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignant findings. For the current sample, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement does not confirm malignancy in the current sample.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not provided for the current sample as it does not show clear malignant changes. The statement mentions earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer, implying those biopsies would have had a Gleason grade, but it does not provide that information for the current sample. Therefore, for the current sample, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it is a benign statement or does not confirm malignancy.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not directly assessable from the current sample but is hinted at through the history), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements. Note that while there's a history of prostate cancer, the current sample does not show malignancy, guiding the choices made for "malignantTumorFindings" and "gleasonGrade."
