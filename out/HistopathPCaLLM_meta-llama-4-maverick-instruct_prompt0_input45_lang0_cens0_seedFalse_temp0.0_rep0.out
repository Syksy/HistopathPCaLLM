To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "a fusing tumor tissue focus" and describes characteristics of the tumor, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "classes 3+4" and "tissue gleason 3." The Gleason score is a system of grading prostate cancer based on how it looks under a microscope. The score is based on the two most prevalent patterns of cell growth ( Gleason patterns), which are added together to give a total score. The statement directly mentions "classes 3+4," indicating a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in valid JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7", following the "major+minor=sum" format.
