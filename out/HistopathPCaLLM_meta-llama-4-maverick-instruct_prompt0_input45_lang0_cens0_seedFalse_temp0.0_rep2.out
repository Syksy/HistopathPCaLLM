To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "a fusing tumor tissue focus" and describes characteristics of the tumor, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "classes 3+4" and "tissue gleason 3." The Gleason score is a system of grading prostate cancer based on how it looks under a microscope. The Gleason score is calculated by adding the grades of the two most prevalent patterns of cell growth ( Gleason patterns) together. The statement directly mentions "classes 3+4," indicating a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Given the information and the requirement to return the structured answers in valid JSON format for the most severe lesion without nested structures, the structured data would be as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- `sample_type`: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
- `malignant_findings`: "yes" (indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings)
- `gleason_grade`: "3+4=7" (the reported Gleason grade for the malignant findings)
