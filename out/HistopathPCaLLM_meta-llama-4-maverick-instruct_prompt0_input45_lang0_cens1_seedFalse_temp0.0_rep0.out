To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions specific sections (e.g., E, F, G, O, P) and the presence of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, which could be indicative of a more extensive surgical specimen. The mention of "capsel intact" and examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes might lean more towards a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, but the description lacks definitive indicators. Given the information, the most likely sample type isn't clearly stated, so we'll have to consider it as not directly determinable or "NA" for the purpose of this task.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be indicative of malignancy. However, it also states that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and concludes with "Further inspection is needed." This suggests uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy. Despite the suspicious features, the lack of a definitive diagnosis means we can't conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "NA" due to the uncertainty and the need for further inspection.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is contingent upon a diagnosis of malignancy. Since the diagnosis is uncertain and further inspection is needed, a Gleason grade is not provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the task's requirements by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" when the information is not available or not applicable.
