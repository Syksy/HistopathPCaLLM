To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions specific sections (e.g., E, F, G, O, P) and the presence of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, which could be indicative of a more extensive surgical specimen. The mention of "capsel intact" and examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes might suggest a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as these are common features examined in RP specimens. However, without explicit mention, this is an inference. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or TURP. Given the information and the context, the most likely sample type is "RP" due to the detailed description of the specimen, but it's not definitive.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be indicative of malignancy. However, it also states that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and concludes with "Further inspection is needed." This ambiguity makes it difficult to definitively classify the findings as malignant or benign based solely on the given text. The presence of a "suspect" lesion and the description might lean towards a potential malignancy, but the statement does not conclusively diagnose malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is contingent upon a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The text does not confirm the presence of cancer, nor does it provide a Gleason score.

Based on the analysis:

- For the **Original Sample Type**, we will choose "RP" as it's the most plausible given the context, though it's not a definitive identification.
- For **Malignant Tumor Findings**, the statement is ambiguous and does not conclusively state the presence of malignancy, so we will choose "NA" due to the lack of a clear diagnosis.
- For the **Gleason Grade**, since there's no clear diagnosis of malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, we will choose "NA".

Here's the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields. The values are chosen based on the analysis of the given statement.
