To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions specific sections (e.g., E, F, G, O, P) and the presence of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, which could be indicative of a more extensive surgical specimen. The mention of "capsel intact" and examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes might lean more towards a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, but the description lacks definitive indicators. Given the information, the most likely sample type isn't clearly stated, so we'll have to consider it as not clearly identified or "NA" for the purpose of this task.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be indicative of malignancy. However, it also states that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and concludes with "Further inspection is needed." This ambiguity makes it difficult to definitively classify the findings as malignant or benign. The presence of a suspicious focus suggests potential malignancy, but the statement doesn't confirm malignancy. Therefore, we might consider this as "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is contingent upon a diagnosis of malignancy. Since the statement doesn't confirm malignancy and doesn't provide a Gleason score, the appropriate response would be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly confirm a malignant lesion), would be:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the ambiguity and lack of definitive information in the provided statement regarding the sample type, the presence of malignancy, and the Gleason grade.
