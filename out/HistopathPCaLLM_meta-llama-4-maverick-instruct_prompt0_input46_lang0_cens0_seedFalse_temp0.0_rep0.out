To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings," which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample type because it involves chippings or fragments of prostate tissue.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Therefore, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there are no malignant tumor findings (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format. The required fields are "sampleType", "malignantTumorFindings", and "gleasonGrade".

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
