To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. TURP is a surgical procedure used to remove prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Now, let's structure this information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the absence thereof) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
