To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. TURP is a surgical procedure used to remove prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the answer is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement.
