To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate material" but does not directly state the type of sample. However, it mentions that the "Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run," which is more indicative of a biopsy. There's no clear mention of it being "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This implies that the presence of malignant tumor findings could not be determined or confirmed. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it is not definitively "yes" or "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer and mentions "Regular prostate tissue with glands seen under microscope" along with some features that "might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia," it does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is used for malignant tumors, and since the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed). The fields are:
- `sample_type`: "biopsy"
- `malignant_findings`: "NA" because the presence of cancer couldn't be assessed.
- `gleason_grade`: "NA" as there's no confirmed malignancy to grade.
