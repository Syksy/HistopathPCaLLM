To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate material" but does not directly state the type of sample. However, it mentions that the "Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run," which is a common practice for biopsy samples. There's no explicit mention of it being "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "Regular prostate tissue with glands seen under microscope" and mentions "findings which might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia." It explicitly states, "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant tumor findings. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the answer leans towards "NA" due to the inability to assess.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned, and given that the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is inferred as "biopsy" due to the context provided.
- Malignant tumor findings are "NA" because the statement indicates an inability to assess the presence of cancer-related changes.
- The reported Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no confirmed malignancy.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the most severe lesion (or lack thereof) described in the histopathological statement.
