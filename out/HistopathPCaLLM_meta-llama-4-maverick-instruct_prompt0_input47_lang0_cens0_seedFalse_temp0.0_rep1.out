To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement concludes with "No malign findings on the left or the right." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there were no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Now, let's structure these answers into a valid JSON format. The required fields are "sampleType", "malignantFindings", and "gleasonGrade".

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason grade is provided).
