To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostatic material" and gives a total amount, suggesting it is a specimen from a surgical procedure. It doesn't directly state the type, but given the context (amount of material and description), it is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure that involves removing prostate tissue.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that the presence of malignancy could not be confirmed or ruled out definitively. However, the closest answer to this ambiguity, given the allowed values ("yes", "no", or "NA"), is "NA" because it indicates that the information is not available or not determinable.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence here, combined with the uncertainty about malignancy, suggests that the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy was not confirmed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
