To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostatic material" and gives a total amount, suggesting it is a specimen from a surgical procedure. It doesn't directly state the type, but given the context (amount of material and description), it is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure that involves removing prostate tissue. The statement doesn't explicitly rule out "TURP," and the mention of a significant amount of material (70 in total) is consistent with this. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive presence or absence of malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because it is not conclusively stated as "yes" or "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy and does not provide any details about the tumor's differentiation or grade, the Gleason grade is not reported. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
