To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." Prostate resection is commonly associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first tumor focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason 5 is predominant (>80%), with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason grades. The highest Gleason score mentioned is for the second focus with a predominant Gleason 5 and a secondary Gleason 4, making the score 5+4=9. The summary directly mentions "Gleason 9," which aligns with this. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
