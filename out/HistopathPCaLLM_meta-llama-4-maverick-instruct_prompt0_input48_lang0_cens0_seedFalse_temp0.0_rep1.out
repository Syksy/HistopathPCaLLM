To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." Prostate resection can be associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Given the context, "RP" seems to be the most appropriate answer as it involves examining a significant portion of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles, which is consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) in the prostate resection. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first tumor focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason 5 is predominant (>80%), with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." 
   - The Gleason score is calculated by adding the two most common Gleason grades. The statement directly provides a summary Gleason score of 9. To adhere to the "major+minor=sum" format, we need to understand that the most severe lesion is being considered. The second focus has a predominant Gleason 5 and a smaller portion of Gleason 4, suggesting a Gleason score of 5+4=9, which matches the summary provided.

Therefore, based on the analysis:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "5+4=9".

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```
