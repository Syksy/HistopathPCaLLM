To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." Prostate resection is commonly associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first tumor focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason 5 is predominant (>80%), with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason grades. The statement directly provides a summary Gleason score of 9. To adhere to the "major+minor=sum" format, we need to infer that the most severe lesion has a Gleason score that can be broken down into its components. Since the second focus has a predominant Gleason 5 and a smaller portion of Gleason 4, it can be inferred that the Gleason score of 9 refers to a "5+4=9" grading, making it the most severe lesion.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format, is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured data:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "5+4=9".
