To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample was obtained from autopsies, it doesn't directly fit into "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match any of the specific sample types mentioned.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe." However, it does not explicitly state that these changes are malignant. It also mentions that due to the nature of the demonstration, it's not used to derive differentiation scores, implying the focus isn't on diagnosing malignancy. Without a clear indication of malignancy, and given the context that it's for educational purposes, the safest interpretation would lean towards "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." This implies that a Gleason score was not provided or determined, likely because the material was used for educational purposes rather than diagnostic. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the statement doesn't directly support identifying a "most severe lesion").
