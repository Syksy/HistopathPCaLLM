To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample was obtained from autopsies, it doesn't directly fit into "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't align with the clinical sampling methods listed.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe." However, it does not explicitly state that these changes are malignant. It also mentions that due to the nature of the demonstration, it's not used to derive differentiation scores, implying the focus isn't on diagnosing malignancy. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine the presence of malignant tumor findings. The statement does not directly say "yes" or "no" to malignancy, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." This implies that a Gleason score was not provided or determined, likely because the material was for educational purposes rather than diagnostic. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly imply multiple lesions with varying severity, it does mention "some exemplifying histological changes") or the available information is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements.
