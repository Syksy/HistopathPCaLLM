To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample was obtained from autopsies, it doesn't fit into "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP" categories as these refer to specific clinical procedures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the sample was not obtained through one of these procedures but rather from autopsies.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe." However, it does not explicitly state that these changes are malignant. It also mentions that due to the nature of the demonstration, the findings are not used to derive differentiation scores (like Gleason scores), which are typically used for malignant tumors. The text does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" based on the information given. The statement seems to be more educational and doesn't directly address the malignancy. Hence, the answer could be considered "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that the findings are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." This implies that a Gleason grade was not reported or determined, likely because the purpose was educational rather than diagnostic. Therefore, the answer to the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (though the text doesn't directly support identifying a "most severe lesion") or the overall findings would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the analysis based on the provided statement and adheres to the required format and allowed values.
