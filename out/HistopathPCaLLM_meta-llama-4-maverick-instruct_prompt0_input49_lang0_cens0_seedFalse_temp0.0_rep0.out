To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses," which is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. TURP is a surgical procedure where tissue is removed from the prostate. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma." Carcinoma indicates the presence of malignant tumor cells. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason classes found in the sample. It mentions that the "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is typically calculated by adding the two most prevalent Gleason patterns (or grades). Therefore, the Gleason score here is "3+4". To calculate the sum: 3 + 4 = 7. So, the Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
