To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses," which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. TURP is a surgical procedure used to treat an enlarged prostate, and it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or shavings. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma." Carcinoma refers to cancer, so there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason classes found in the sample. It mentions that the "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is calculated by adding the two most prevalent Gleason grades. Therefore, the Gleason score here is "3+4=sum". To calculate the sum: 3 + 4 = 7. So, the reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
