To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses," which is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. TURP is a surgical procedure where tissue is removed from the prostate. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason classes as follows: "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason score is typically calculated by adding the two most prevalent Gleason patterns (or classes) observed in the tumor. Therefore, the Gleason score here is "3+4=7". 

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were malignant tumor findings, so it's "yes".
- The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".
