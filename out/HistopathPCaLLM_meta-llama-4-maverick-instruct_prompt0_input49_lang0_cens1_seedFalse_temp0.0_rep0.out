To address the given task, let's analyze the provided statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" which implies a biopsy, as it refers to samples being examined on slides/glasses. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) and RP (Radical Prostatectomy) could also involve examination on slides, but the term "samples" and the context more generally aligns with a biopsy. However, without explicit mention, one might argue it could be TURP. Yet, given the context, "biopsy" seems a reasonable interpretation.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the fifth glass contained "some changes that warrant further investigation" but does not confirm malignancy. It suggests uncertainty or suspicion rather than a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, it is not clear if there are malignant tumor findings. The statement leans towards not confirming malignancy due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is contingent upon a diagnosis of malignancy. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and instead suggests the need for further investigation, it does not provide a Gleason grade.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement does not explicitly confirm a malignant lesion) and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

**Rationale**:
- **originalSampleType**: "biopsy" is chosen due to the context implying sampled tissue examined on slides.
- **malignantTumorFindings**: "NA" is selected because the statement does not confirm malignancy; it suggests further investigation is needed.
- **gleasonGrade**: "NA" is appropriate as there's no confirmed malignancy and thus no Gleason grade provided or applicable.
