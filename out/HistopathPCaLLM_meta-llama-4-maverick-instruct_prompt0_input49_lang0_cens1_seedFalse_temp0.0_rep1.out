To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and apply it to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses," which implies a biopsy or possibly a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve sampling prostate tissue. However, the term "on 8 glasses" is more commonly associated with biopsy samples being examined on glass slides. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the "fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation." This implies that there are suspicious findings, but it does not confirm malignancy. The statement explicitly says "assessing the findings further is not possibile due to the technical limitations," indicating uncertainty or inconclusiveness regarding the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" to malignant findings. The most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and mentions that further assessment is not possible due to technical limitations, it does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer diagnosis, and its application here is not feasible due to the uncertainty around the malignancy. Thus, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" where appropriate.
