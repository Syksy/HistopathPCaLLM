To address the given task, let's analyze the provided statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" and refers to a "fifth glass." This context suggests a biopsy, as it involves examining specific portions (or "glasses") of a sample. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't directly stated. Given the context, "biopsy" seems the most plausible as it involves sampling tissue. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) and TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are more specific procedures, and while TURP could be considered due to the mention of "prostate samples," the description leans more towards a diagnostic sampling which is typically associated with biopsy. Therefore, we'll categorize it as "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that there are "some changes that warrant further investigation" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states that assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations, implying uncertainty or suspicion rather than confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignant findings. The statement does not categorically rule out malignancy either, but given the uncertainty, the most appropriate answer is "NA" as it doesn't clearly state "yes" or "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for prostate cancer, grading the aggressiveness of the tumor. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade or confirm the presence of cancer; it suggests further investigation is needed. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" as there's no confirmed malignancy or reported grade.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Providing the most severe lesion's characteristics (though in this case, the severity or presence of malignancy isn't confirmed).
- Returning the data in a non-nested JSON structure.
- Using the allowed values for each field.
