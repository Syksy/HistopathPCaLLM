To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement notes that "the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed" and further clarifies that "the samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the samples are benign and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA."

Now, let's structure these findings into a valid JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields requested:
- The original sample type is "biopsy."
- There were no malignant tumor findings, so it's "no."
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the samples were benign.
