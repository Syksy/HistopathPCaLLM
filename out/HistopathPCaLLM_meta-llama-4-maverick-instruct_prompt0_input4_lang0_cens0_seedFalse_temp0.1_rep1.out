To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations." Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no indication of multiple lesions with varying severity). Since the statement does not indicate any malignant findings, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
