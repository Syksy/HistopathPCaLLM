To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample part" and "sampled tissue." This context suggests that the sample is from a biopsy, as it discusses multiple samples from different locations, which is typical for biopsy procedures. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and further clarifies that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." Although it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings, the lack of "notable atypic patterns" and the specific concern about adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) suggest a cautious interpretation leaning towards not having identified malignancy. However, the insufficiency for a reliable assessment complicates this. For the purpose of structuring, since it doesn't confirm malignancy and is insufficient for a definitive assessment, we might lean towards "NA" due to the ambiguity and insufficiency of the sample for a clear diagnosis.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used for grading prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it doesn't confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since the sample is either benign or insufficient for a cancer diagnosis.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Identifying the original sample type as "biopsy."
- Reporting "NA" for malignant tumor findings due to the insufficient sample for a definitive assessment.
- Reporting "NA" for the Gleason grade, as there's no confirmed malignancy.
