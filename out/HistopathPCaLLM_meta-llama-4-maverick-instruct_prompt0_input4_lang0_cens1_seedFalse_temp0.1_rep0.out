To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample part" and "sampled tissue." This context suggests that the sample is from a biopsy, as it discusses multiple samples from different locations, which is typical for biopsy procedures. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and further clarifies that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." Although it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings, the lack of notable atypic patterns and the specific mention of insufficient material to assess for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) implies that there's no clear evidence of malignancy. However, the uncertainty due to insufficient material for a reliable assessment leans towards a cautious interpretation. Still, based on the information given, we can infer that there were no clear malignant tumor findings observed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is a measure used for grading prostate cancer based on biopsy samples. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it doesn't confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample was either benign or insufficient for a cancer diagnosis.

Given these interpretations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (and noting that the sample is not confirmed to be malignant), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified format and provides the required information based on the given histopathological statement.
