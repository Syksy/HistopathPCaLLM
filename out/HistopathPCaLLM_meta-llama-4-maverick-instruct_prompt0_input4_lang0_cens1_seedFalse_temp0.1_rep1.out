To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample material" and "sampled tissue." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it discusses sampling sites and the material being representative of prostate tissue, it is likely referring to a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most reasonable inference based on the information given is that the sample type is a "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and that "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies that there were no clear malignant findings observed, but it also wasn't possible to definitively rule out adenocarcinoma due to insufficient material. However, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. Thus, we can infer that there were no definitive malignant tumor findings reported.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor), the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and in this case, the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer, so a Gleason grade is not provided.

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is inferred to be "biopsy."
- There were no malignant tumor findings confirmed ("no").
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements and provides the structured data based on the given histopathological statement.
