To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample material" and "sampled tissue." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it discusses sampling sites and the material being representative of prostate tissue, it is likely referring to a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's from a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most reasonable inference based on the information given is that the sample type is a "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and that "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies that there were no clear malignant findings observed, but it also wasn't possible to definitively rule out adenocarcinoma due to insufficient material. However, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings leans towards "no" because it states no atypic patterns were present, even though it couldn't be reliably assessed for adenocarcinoma.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma and mentions that the material is insufficient for a reliable assessment, it does not provide a Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as there's no malignant diagnosis made.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
