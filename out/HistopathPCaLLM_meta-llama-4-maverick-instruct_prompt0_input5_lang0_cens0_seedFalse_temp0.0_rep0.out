To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides Gleason grades for two macros (A and B) of the apex. For macro A, the Gleason grade is "4+3" with a sum of 7. For macro B, it's "4+5" with a sum of 9. Since macro B has a higher sum (9), it represents the more severe lesion. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required:
- The original sample type is "RP".
- There were malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9".
