To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a prostate specimen. It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it mentions samples from apex and basis and refers to a relatively enlarged prostate, we can infer it's likely a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen because it includes detailed anatomical parts like apex and basis, which are typically examined in RP specimens. Biopsy and TURP specimens might not always include such detailed anatomical references in this context. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." This implies that there are suspicious findings that could be malignant, suggesting that malignant tumor findings are likely present, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This indicates that a Gleason grade could not be determined or reported, likely due to the complexity or uncertainty of the tumor architecture. However, since there are suspicious findings and the context implies a potential malignancy, we still need to consider how to represent this. The Gleason grade is typically reported in the form "major+minor=sum". Since it couldn't be inferred, we should consider it as not available or "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information according to the given requirements:

- **Original Sample Type**: "RP"
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: "yes"
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements of providing a non-nested structure with the specified fields and allowed values.
