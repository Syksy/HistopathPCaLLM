To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a prostate specimen. It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it mentions samples from apex and basis and refers to a "relatively enlargened prostate," it suggests a significant surgical specimen. The term "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which involves the removal of the prostate gland. The detailed description of sampling from apex and basis is consistent with a RP specimen. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." This implies that there are suspicious findings that could be malignant, but it does not directly confirm malignancy. However, the fact that a "suspected higher sum" is mentioned (presumably referring to a Gleason sum) and that the case is being referred for further inspection due to suspicion, suggests that malignant tumor findings are likely. Thus, we can infer that malignant tumor findings are likely present, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This indicates that a specific Gleason grade (in the form of major+minor=sum) could not be determined. Therefore, despite the suspicion of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not reported. Hence, for the purpose of this task, it should be considered as "NA" because a specific value is not provided.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the given statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
