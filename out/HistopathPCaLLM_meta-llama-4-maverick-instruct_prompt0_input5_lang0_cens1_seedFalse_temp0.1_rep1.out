To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a prostate specimen. The context suggests that the sample is likely from a surgical procedure. The mention of processing samples from different parts of the prostate (apex and basis) and the use of different dyes for sections from the left and right sides indicates a significant surgical specimen. The description best fits a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) specimen, as it involves detailed examination of various parts of the prostate.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that there is suspicion of malignancy due to the observation of "different kind of architectures" between the main macros, and a "suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The fact that it's suspected and further inspection is recommended implies that malignancy is not definitively confirmed in the statement provided. Nonetheless, the context implies that there is a suspicion or likelihood of malignancy, so we'll consider it as "yes" for malignant tumor findings because the sample is being further inspected for a suspected higher Gleason sum.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This indicates that a specific Gleason grade (in the form of major+minor=sum) could not be determined from the available information. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not possible to infer it.

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the information provided in the statement.
