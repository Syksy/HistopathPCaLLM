To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a prostate specimen. The context suggests that the sample is likely from a surgical procedure involving the prostate. The terms "apex and basis" are commonly used in the context of radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves chips of prostate tissue, and while it could involve various parts of the prostate, the specific mention of "apex and basis" processed longitudinally and in cross-sections aligns more with an RP specimen. Biopsy typically involves smaller, more targeted samples. Therefore, the most likely original sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." This implies that there are suspicious findings that could be malignant, as there's a mention of suspecting a "higher sum" (presumably referring to a Gleason sum), which is relevant in the context of prostate cancer grading. Thus, it suggests that malignant tumor findings are likely present, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." However, it also mentions a "suspected higher sum," indicating that there is some suspicion of malignancy and an attempt to assess the Gleason score. Despite this, a definitive Gleason score is not provided. For the purpose of structuring the data, since a specific Gleason grade (in the form of "major+minor=sum") is not given and the statement indicates that it "could not be inferred," we should consider it as not having a reported Gleason grade in the required format. Thus, we cannot directly provide a Gleason score in the "major+minor=sum" format. For malignant cases where Gleason score is not available or not assessable, the requirement is to still follow the format as closely as possible.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and avoiding nested structures, would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the specified format and requirements:
- `originalSampleType` is "RP" based on the context suggesting a radical prostatectomy specimen.
- `malignantTumorFindings` is "yes" due to the suspicious findings and the mention of a suspected higher Gleason sum.
- `gleasonGrade` is "NA" because, despite the suspicion of malignancy, a specific Gleason grade in the required "major+minor=sum" format could not be determined from the statement.
