To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "shaving chips" and that they are "run via three tissue cassettes." This context suggests the sample is not a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, nor is it typically described as a biopsy in the traditional sense (though biopsies can be in the form of chips, the term "shaving chips" is more indicative of a TURP procedure). TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a procedure where chips of prostate tissue are removed. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with findings suggestive of "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer, so for a benign condition, it should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format gives:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no malignant lesion to report).
