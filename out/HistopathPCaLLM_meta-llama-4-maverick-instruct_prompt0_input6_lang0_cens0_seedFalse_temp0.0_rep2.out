To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue cassettes." This description is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves shaving chips, which is a characteristic of TURP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the presence of "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and mentions that the "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant findings; instead, it suggests a benign condition. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) and does not mention any malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of prostate cancer. For benign statements, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
- The reported Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample was benign.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
