To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue cassettes." This description is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves shaving chips, which is a characteristic of TURP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the presence of "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and mentions that the "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant findings; instead, it suggests a benign condition. Therefore, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) and does not mention any malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
