To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue cassettes." This description is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves shaving chips, which is a characteristic of TURP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the presence of "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and mentions that the "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no indication of malignant tumor findings; instead, it suggests a benign condition.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) without any mention of malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis:

- The original sample type is "TURP".
- There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample was benign.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
