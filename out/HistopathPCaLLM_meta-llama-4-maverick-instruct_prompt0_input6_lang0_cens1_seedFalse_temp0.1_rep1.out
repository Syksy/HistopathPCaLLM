To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material." This indicates that the sample is not from a biopsy but from a surgical operation. The terms "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are both related to surgical procedures. Given that it's described as "prostatic operation material" and not specifically as a biopsy or TURP, and considering the context that RP is a more specific term for a prostate operation, we can infer that the sample is likely from a "RP." However, the statement does not explicitly rule out "TURP," but "RP" seems more plausible due to the mention of "original prostatic operation material." Since it's not explicitly stated as "TURP" or "biopsy," and assuming "RP" is the most likely "prostatic operation," we'll consider it as "RP." Thus, the sample type is "RP."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but due to a "heavy burn artefact," the majority of the sample "cannot be further inspected." It concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of malignancy is not confirmed or denied due to the artefact. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the results are inconclusive due to the heavy burn artefact and there's no clear indication of malignancy or a specific grade, the Gleason grade cannot be determined. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information that can be reliably extracted from the given statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the assessment is inconclusive).
