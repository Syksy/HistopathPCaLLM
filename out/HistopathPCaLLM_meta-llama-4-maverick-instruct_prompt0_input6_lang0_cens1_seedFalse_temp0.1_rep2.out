To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material." This indicates that the sample is not from a biopsy but from a surgical operation. The terms "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are both related to surgical procedures. Given that it's described as "prostatic operation material" and not specifically as a biopsy or TURP, and considering the context that RP is a more specific term for a prostatectomy, we can infer that the sample is likely from a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, without explicit mention, one might argue it could be "TURP." The statement does not directly support "TURP," and "RP" seems more plausible due to the mention of "original prostatic operation material," which aligns more closely with the nature of RP.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but due to a "heavy burn artefact," the majority of the sample "cannot be further inspected." It concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of malignancy is not confirmed or denied due to the artefact; hence, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignant findings. Thus, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the results are inconclusive due to the heavy burn artefact and there's no clear indication of malignancy or a specific grade, the Gleason grade cannot be determined. Therefore, the answer should be "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "RP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values or "NA" where appropriate. Note that while there's a slight ambiguity around "originalSampleType," "RP" is chosen based on the context provided.
