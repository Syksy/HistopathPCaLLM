To tackle this task, let's analyze the given histopathological statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma" in one of the samples. Although it concludes that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Therefore, we can consider this as a "yes" for malignant tumor findings because it suggests adenocarcinoma, even though it's not definitive.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not include a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because it's not provided.

Now, let's structure this information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

Here's how the extraction aligns with the requirements:
- The sample type is correctly identified as "biopsy."
- Malignant findings are considered "yes" due to the suspicion of adenocarcinoma.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" since it's not reported.

This structured data adheres to the specified format and requirements.
