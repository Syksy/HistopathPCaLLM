To tackle this task, let's analyze the given histopathological statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Thus, we can infer that there are malignant tumor findings, albeit not definitively confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The description is focused on the suspicion of adenocarcinoma without grading it.

Now, let's structure the information according to the given instructions:

- **Original Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: Since there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, we consider this as "yes" because the statement implies the presence of malignant tumor findings, even though it's not conclusive.
- **Reported Gleason Grade**: "NA" because the Gleason grade is not provided.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the histopathological statement.
