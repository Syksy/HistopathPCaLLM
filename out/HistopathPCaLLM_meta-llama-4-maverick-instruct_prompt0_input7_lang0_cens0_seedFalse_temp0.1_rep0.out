To tackle this task, let's analyze the given histopathological statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it concludes that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Thus, we can infer that there are malignant tumor findings, but the diagnosis is not definitive.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The description is not conclusive for adenocarcinoma, and there's no mention of Gleason scoring.

Given these observations:

- The **original sample type** is "biopsy" because the statement refers to "prostate biopsies."
- **Malignant tumor findings** are suspected but not conclusively diagnosed. However, for the purpose of this task and based on the provided instructions, we will consider it as "yes" because there's a mention of morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, even though it's not definitive.
- The **reported Gleason grade** is "NA" because there's no Gleason grade mentioned or implied in the statement.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (since there's only one lesion described), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields as per the instructions.
