To tackle this task, let's analyze the given histopathological statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." This directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it notes that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Thus, we can infer that there are malignant tumor findings, albeit not definitively confirmed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not include a Gleason score, which is typically assigned to more definitive diagnoses of prostate cancer.

Now, let's structure the data according to the given instructions:

- **Sample Type**: The sample is from "prostate biopsies," so the sample type is "biopsy."
- **Malignant Tumor Findings**: Despite the diagnosis being on a "suspicion-level," the presence of morphological changes "suggesting adenocarcinoma" indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not provide a Gleason score and the diagnosis is not definitive, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Here's the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as requested, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
