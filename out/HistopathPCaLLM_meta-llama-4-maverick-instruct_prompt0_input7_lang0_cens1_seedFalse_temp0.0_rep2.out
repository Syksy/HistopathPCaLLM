To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate sample material" without specifying the type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards any of the allowed values, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to lack of information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that while there were some suspicious features, they were not conclusive for malignancy. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because the diagnosis was inconclusive.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Given that there's no mention of a malignant diagnosis or Gleason score, and the findings were not conclusive, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions, the information provided doesn't support a detailed differentiation), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
