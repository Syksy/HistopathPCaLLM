To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate sample material" without specifying the type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards any of the allowed values, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there was suspicion but not a confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" or potentially "no" if we interpret "no definite conclusions" as leaning towards not being able to confirm malignancy. However, given the context and the allowed values, "NA" seems more appropriate because it reflects the uncertainty.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It discusses atypical structures but doesn't confirm malignancy or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since the statement is not conclusive about malignancy.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions, it discusses a singular "point of interest"), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (or the lesion discussed, as there's only one mentioned). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
