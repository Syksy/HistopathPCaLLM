To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate sample material" without specifying the type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards any of the allowed values, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that while there were some suspicious features, they were not conclusive for malignancy. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Given that there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format gives:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given free format text, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, no lesion was definitively diagnosed) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
