To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate sample material" without specifying the type. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, we'll have to consider it as "NA" (Not Available or Not Specified).

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that while there were some suspicious features, the presence of malignancy was not confirmed. Therefore, we should categorize this as "NA" because the statement doesn't definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since the statement doesn't confirm malignancy and doesn't provide a Gleason score, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the presence of a malignant lesion was not confirmed).
