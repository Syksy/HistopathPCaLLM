To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate." Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP." Therefore, the original sample type for the most severe lesion (which is related to the prostate cancer findings) is "RP."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "In the third sample tumor tissue is observed... with invasive properties." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides the Gleason grade as "4+3=7." This matches the required format of "major+minor=sum." Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object directly answers the three structured fields required, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement.
