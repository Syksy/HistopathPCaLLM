To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3," indicating multiple samples were taken. It specifies that "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest." The types of samples (biopsy, RP, TURP) are not directly mentioned, but given the context, it seems the samples are biopsies because they are referred to with indices and varying quantities, which is common in biopsy reports. Therefore, the original sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." However, it also discusses Gleason patterns and PIN changes in the context of Sample 3, suggesting that Sample 3 is the one of interest for malignancy assessment. Although it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," it implies there was an attempt or expectation to identify Gleason patterns, suggesting a suspicion or presence of malignancy. Thus, for Sample 3, which is the focus, malignant tumor findings are implied to be potentially present, so the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that "the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This indicates that a Gleason score was expected or attempted but not properly recorded or reported. However, since the actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is not provided and is considered missing, and given the instruction to follow the format strictly, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because the specific values for major, minor, and sum are not available.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the provided text, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
