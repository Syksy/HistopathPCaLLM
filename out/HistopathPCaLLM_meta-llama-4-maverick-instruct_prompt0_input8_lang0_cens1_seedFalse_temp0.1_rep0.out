To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3," indicating multiple samples were taken. It specifies that "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest." The types of samples (biopsy, RP, TURP) are not directly mentioned, but given the context, it seems likely that these are biopsy samples because the statement discusses examining across the third sample and mentions specific percentages of the sample involved, which is consistent with biopsy reporting. There's no clear indication that it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the most reasonable inference based on the information given is that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." However, it discusses Gleason patterns and PIN changes in the context of Sample 3, suggesting that Sample 3 is the one of interest for malignancy. Although it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," it implies there was some level of suspicion or indication of malignancy or pre-malignant changes (PIN changes) in Sample 3. Thus, for Sample 3, which is the focus for the most severe lesion, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not explicitly confirmed due to missing information on Gleason score. However, the discussion around Gleason patterns and PIN changes implies a context of malignancy or potential malignancy. Still, the explicit confirmation of malignancy is not clearly stated for Sample 3. Therefore, based on the information given and focusing on Sample 3, we might infer "yes" due to the context, but it's not a straightforward conclusion.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This indicates that a Gleason score was not properly recorded or reported for the most significant lesion (in Sample 3), despite some level of tumor being present. Therefore, we cannot accurately fill in the "major+minor=sum" format as the specific numbers are not provided.

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (Sample 3), would be as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind the choices:
- **originalSampleType**: "biopsy" because the context suggests biopsy samples.
- **malignantTumorFindings**: "yes" because, despite the lack of explicit confirmation, the discussion around Gleason patterns and PIN changes in Sample 3 implies a context of potential or suspected malignancy.
- **gleasonGrade**: "NA" because the specific Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is not reported due to missing information.

This interpretation adheres to the task's requirements and the provided instructions for handling the data.
