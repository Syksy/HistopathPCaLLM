To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3", indicating multiple samples were taken. It specifies that "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest". The types of samples (biopsy, RP, TURP) are not directly mentioned, but given the context, it seems likely that these are biopsy samples since specific details about the type are not provided and it's common for multiple samples to be taken during a biopsy. However, without explicit information, we must be cautious. The statement does not directly indicate the sample type, so we should consider the context and the information given. Since it's not explicitly stated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given that multiple samples are mentioned which is common in biopsy, we might lean towards "biopsy". However, the exact type isn't clearly stated, which could suggest "NA" if we weren't leaning towards biopsy due to the context. For the purpose of this task and based on the information given, we'll consider it as "biopsy".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." However, it discusses various histological properties and Gleason patterns for Sample 3, suggesting that Sample 3 is the one of interest for malignancy. Although it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and discusses suspicious changes and immunological activity, it doesn't directly confirm malignancy in Sample 3. The mention of Gleason patterns implies a suspicion or consideration of malignancy, but the absence of a clear Gleason score due to "empty fields" complicates this. Despite this, the context implies that Sample 3 is the most relevant for assessing malignancy, and there's a discussion around Gleason patterns, suggesting a potential malignancy. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignant tumor findings because the discussion around Gleason patterns and the detailed examination of Sample 3 implies a context where malignancy is being considered or evaluated.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This indicates that while there was an attempt to assess the Gleason grade, the specific values for the major and minor patterns, and thus the sum, were not recorded or reported. Therefore, we cannot provide a Gleason grade in the form requested ("major+minor=sum"). Given this, and since the information is not available due to what appears to be a recording issue, we should consider this as "NA" because we cannot accurately fill in the "major+minor=sum" format.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (Sample 3 in this case), would be:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information provided in the statement.
