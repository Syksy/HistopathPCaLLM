To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3", indicating multiple samples were taken. It specifies that "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest". The types of samples (biopsy, RP, TURP) are not directly mentioned. However, given the context that multiple samples were taken and examined, and the detailed histological examination described, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy" since RP (Radical Prostatectomy) and TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are typically more specific in their descriptions and implications. There's no clear indication that it's RP or TURP, so we'll consider "biopsy" as the most plausible sample type based on the information given.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." However, it discusses various histological properties and Gleason patterns for Sample 3, suggesting that Sample 3 is the one of interest for malignancy. Although it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing", it implies there was some level of suspicion or indication of malignancy or pre-malignant changes (e.g., "Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed"). The presence of Gleason patterns, even if not fully reported, suggests malignant tumor findings were considered. Thus, for Sample 3, the answer is "yes" because it is implied that there were malignant or potentially malignant findings being discussed.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This indicates that a Gleason score was expected or should have been reported but was not due to a possible recording error. Despite this, it implies that there was an attempt or expectation to grade the tumor. However, since the actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is not provided, and it's indicated as missing, we should consider it as not reported or "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (Sample 3), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information provided in the statement.
