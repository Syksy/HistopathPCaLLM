To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material, which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed," indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia," it implies the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data for the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no variation in severity).
