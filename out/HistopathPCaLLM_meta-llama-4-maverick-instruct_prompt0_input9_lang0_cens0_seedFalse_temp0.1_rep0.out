To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material, which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, the original sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed," which directly answers the question. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia," it indicates the sample is benign. For benign statements, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the histopathological statement.
