To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "large quantities of prostate tissue" and a process involving multiple steps, which could hint at a more substantial sample than a typical biopsy. The term "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is often associated with processing large quantities of prostate tissue. The statement doesn't explicitly confirm it, but given the context, "TURP" seems plausible. However, without a clear indication, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) either, as it doesn't mention the removal of the prostate gland. Since the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned and can't be conclusively inferred, we'll have to consider it as "NA" (Not Available) due to lack of clear information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and mentions issues that "could be attributed to technical difficulties in processing of the sample" without clearly stating the presence of malignancy. It concludes that "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" and suspects "a faulty processing of the sample material." The absence of a clear statement regarding malignancy and the overall tone suggesting uncertainty and potential issues with the sample processing leans towards interpreting the result as "NA" or "no" due to the lack of a definitive malignant finding. However, the most accurate interpretation based on the information given is "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Given that there's no clear indication of malignancy and no specific mention of a Gleason score, the appropriate response is "NA".

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- Original Sample Type: "NA"
- Malignant Tumor Findings: "NA"
- Reported Gleason Grade: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "NA",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
