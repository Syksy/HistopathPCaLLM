To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "large quantities of prostate tissue" being observed and mentions processing and histological examination, which could be applicable to various sample types. Since it doesn't specify, and given the context doesn't clearly point towards "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) directly, but does imply a significant amount of tissue was processed, we might lean towards "TURP" due to the mention of "large quantities of prostate tissue." However, without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the "epithelial cell lining appears rather normal," and while there are some irregularities in the "grandular structures," it attributes these to "technical difficulties in processing of the sample." It concludes that the material examined doesn't allow for conclusive conclusions and suspects "faulty processing." There's no clear indication of malignancy; hence, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings would be "no" based on the information provided, as it leans towards a benign or inconclusive interpretation due to processing issues rather than stating a malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and the statement doesn't confirm the presence of cancer. Therefore, the answer for the Gleason grade should be "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured answers to the three required fields based on the given histopathological statement.
