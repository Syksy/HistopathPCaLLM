To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and that it was processed in batches. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies a significant amount of tissue was processed, which is more characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or RP (Radical Prostatectomy). However, the context suggests a diagnostic procedure rather than a therapeutic one like RP, leaning more towards TURP due to the quantity of tissue. Yet, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or RP. Given the context, "TURP" seems plausible due to the quantity of tissue processed, but it's not definitive. Therefore, based on the information provided and the allowed values, we might consider it as "TURP" if we had to choose, but it's not a clear-cut decision.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the epithelial cell lining as "rather normal" and mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear disproportionate, possibly due to technical difficulties. It concludes that the material examined is not conclusive and suspects faulty processing. There's no clear indication of malignant findings; in fact, the description leans towards a benign or non-conclusive outcome rather than a malignant one. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there are no indications of malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there's no clear indication of malignancy), is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "TURP",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the provided text and the constraints given. Note that "TURP" is chosen for "originalSampleType" based on the process of elimination and the context provided, though it's not a definitive identification.
