To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue." It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context and the fact that a significant amount of material was processed and examined, we can infer it's likely not a simple biopsy due to the quantity. However, without explicit information, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). The quantity and processing suggest it could be TURP, but it's not definitive. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information given is "NA" because we cannot conclusively determine the sample type.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the epithelial cell lining as "rather normal" and mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear disproportionate, possibly due to technical difficulties. It concludes that the material examined does not allow for conclusive conclusions and suspects faulty processing. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" since the text leans towards a benign or inconclusive interpretation rather than indicating cancer.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA" as there's no malignant statement to report a Gleason grade for.

Given these analyses, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "originalSampleType": "NA",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the given text.
