To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "large quantities of prostate tissue" being observed and mentions processing and histological examination, which could be applicable to various sample types. Since it doesn't specify, and given the context doesn't strongly suggest RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specifically, and doesn't directly indicate a biopsy either, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement describes the epithelial cell lining as "rather normal" and mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear disproportionate, possibly due to technical difficulties. It concludes that the material is not conclusive and suspects faulty processing. There's no clear indication of malignant findings; in fact, the description leans towards a benign or uncertain interpretation due to processing issues. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" since it doesn't clearly state the presence of malignancy and the tone suggests a non-malignant interpretation.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned, and given that the statement doesn't confirm malignancy, the appropriate response is "NA" as there's no malignant diagnosis to report a Gleason score for.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly indicate multiple lesions or malignancy), is as follows:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "NA",
  "malignantFindings": "no",
  "gleasonGrade": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe interpretation possible from the given statement.
