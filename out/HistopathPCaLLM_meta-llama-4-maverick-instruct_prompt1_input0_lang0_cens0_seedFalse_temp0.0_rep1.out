To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g...". The term "chipping" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a surgical procedure used to treat an enlarged prostate. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no malignancies, or carcinoma" were found, and it describes the tissue as "benign prostate tissue". Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the tissue is benign and there's no mention of carcinoma or malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no issue of severity).
