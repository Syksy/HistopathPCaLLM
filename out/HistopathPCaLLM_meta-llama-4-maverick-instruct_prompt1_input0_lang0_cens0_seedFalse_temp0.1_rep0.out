To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples" and the context implies a surgical procedure. Given that it mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g" and "were started in six blocks," it suggests a significant amount of tissue was processed, which is more indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure than a biopsy. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is unlikely because the description doesn't fit the typical RP specimen handling. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no malignancies, or carcinoma" were found, and it describes the tissue as "benign prostate tissue." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the tissue is benign and there's no mention of malignant cells or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Applicable) for this benign finding.

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
