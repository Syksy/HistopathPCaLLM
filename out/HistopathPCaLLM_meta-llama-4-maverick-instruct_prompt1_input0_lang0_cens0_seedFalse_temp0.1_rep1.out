To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g...". The term "chipping" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a surgical procedure used to treat an enlarged prostate. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no malignancies, or carcinoma" were found, and it describes the prostate tissue as "benign". Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the finding is benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" for benign statements.

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
