To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue was observed." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "multiple batches" and examining "prostate tissue." Despite this, the exact sample type isn't clearly stated, so we should be cautious. Given the options and the context, we might lean towards "biopsy" as a plausible sample type, but it's not definitive.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy based on the information provided. The appropriate response would be "NA" as the statement does not confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma and mentions that reliable conclusions cannot be drawn, it does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is relevant for malignant findings, and since the statement is inconclusive regarding malignancy, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind choosing "NA" for "Sampletype" is due to the lack of explicit information about the sample type in the statement. While it could be inferred as potentially being a biopsy, the statement does not directly confirm this, and given the constraints of the allowed values and the need for clarity, "NA" is a safe choice when the information is not directly stated.

Thus, the JSON output reflects the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding the sample type, malignancy, and consequently, the Gleason grade.
