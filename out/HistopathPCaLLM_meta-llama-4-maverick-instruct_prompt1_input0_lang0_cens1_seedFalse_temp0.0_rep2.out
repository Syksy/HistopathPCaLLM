To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue was observed." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the material was run in "multiple batches," which could imply a significant amount of tissue, possibly suggesting TURP. Yet, without a clear indication, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" or "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and it doesn't explicitly state "TURP" either. Given the context, the sample type isn't clearly identified among the allowed values, so it should be considered as "NA" due to lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Thus, it should be considered as "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma and doesn't provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing the required information based on the most severe lesion (which, in this case, isn't identified due to the lack of a clear malignancy diagnosis).
