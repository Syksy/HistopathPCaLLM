To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue was observed." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "multiple batches" and examining "prostate tissue." Despite this, the exact sample type isn't clearly stated, so we must infer or directly state "NA" if not explicitly mentioned. Given the context, it seems like it could be a biopsy, but since it's not explicitly stated and could potentially be TURP or another type, and the instructions are to be precise with allowed values, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy based on the provided information. Hence, the appropriate answer would be "NA" as it reflects the inconclusive nature of the malignancy assessment.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that "reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia" and explicitly states that an inference of malignancy or carcinoma cannot be conducted, it implies there's no diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, the Gleason grade, which is used for malignant tumors, would be "NA" as the statement is related to a benign or inconclusive condition.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" (since the exact type isn't explicitly mentioned)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (as the statement is inconclusive about malignancy)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no confirmed malignancy)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
