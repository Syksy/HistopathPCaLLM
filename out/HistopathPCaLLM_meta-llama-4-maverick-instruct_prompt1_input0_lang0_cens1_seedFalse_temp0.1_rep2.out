To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue was observed." It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context, we can infer it's likely a biopsy or possibly TURP due to the mention of "multiple batches" and "spot-like inflammation." However, without explicit information, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. Thus, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as the statement doesn't confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma and doesn't provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a flat JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
