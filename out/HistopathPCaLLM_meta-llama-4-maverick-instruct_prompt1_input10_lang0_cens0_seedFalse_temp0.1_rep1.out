To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," indicating the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes the presence of "some basal cell hyperplasia" and mentions that "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." It concludes with "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign."
   - This indicates that while there's a suspicion of carcinoma, the diagnosis is not definitive and leans towards benign. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed.
   - Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because the statement leans towards a benign diagnosis and does not confirm malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement does not confirm the presence of carcinoma and leans towards a benign diagnosis, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported.
   - Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" for benign or non-malignant statements.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information extracted from the given histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
