To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It specifies that the samples are prostate tissue material but does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it is reasonable to infer that the sample is likely a "biopsy" since it's discussing prostate tissue material and the issue of staining, which is common in biopsy samples. There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions observing "normal basal cells" in the prostate tissue material and discusses issues related to the immunological staining panel. The presence of normal basal cells and the lack of a clear mention of malignant cells or tumor suggest that there might not be a confirmed malignancy. The text does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings; instead, it focuses on the technical issues with the staining. Therefore, based on the information given, it seems that there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" could be considered as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. It discusses the issue with the immunological staining panel and the observation of normal basal cells but does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. Since there's no mention of malignancy or Gleason grades, the "Gleason" field should be "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy" (as it's the most plausible sample type given the context)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since there's no clear indication of malignancy and the presence of normal basal cells is noted)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no discussion of Gleason grades)

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
