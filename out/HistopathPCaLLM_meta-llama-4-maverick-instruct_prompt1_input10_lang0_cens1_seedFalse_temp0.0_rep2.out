To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue material" and "prostate samples" without specifying the type. Since the type is not directly mentioned, and there's no clear indication towards "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" as it is not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue and mentions the observation of "normal basal cells" and issues related to immunological stainings. It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. However, the presence of "normal basal cells" is often used to rule out malignancy in prostate pathology because their absence is a feature that can support a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The statement concludes with a suspicion related to the staining immunopanel failing, not directly addressing malignancy. Since there's no clear statement about malignancy and the presence of normal basal cells could imply a benign condition, the closest interpretation would be "no" for malignancy, given the context that normal basal cells are typically associated with benign glands.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. It discusses issues with sample examination and immunological stainings but does not provide any information on the Gleason score. Therefore, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade would be "NA" since there's no mention of it, and the context suggests a potentially benign condition.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" because the sample type is not specified.
- **Malignancy**: "no" because the presence of normal basal cells is mentioned, which is typically associated with benign conditions.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because there's no discussion or mention of Gleason grades.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
