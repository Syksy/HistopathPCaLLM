To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them arriving in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it mentions "prostate tissue material" and "prostate samples." Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that these are biopsy samples, as the statement discusses examining tissue material and the use of immunological stainings, which is consistent with biopsy procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material." The presence of normal basal cells typically suggests that the tissue is benign because basal cells are usually absent in malignant prostate glands. There's a mention of "suspicious formations," but it's in the context of the staining immunopanel failing, not directly indicating malignancy. Thus, based on the information given, it appears there were no clear malignant tumor findings reported; instead, the focus is on the integrity of the staining process.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is not indicated here. The discussion revolves around the reliability of the immunostaining panel rather than assessing malignancy or grading.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy."
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not clearly indicate malignancy; instead, it suggests a benign finding by mentioning "normal basal cells." Thus, "Malignancy" can be considered as "no."
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
