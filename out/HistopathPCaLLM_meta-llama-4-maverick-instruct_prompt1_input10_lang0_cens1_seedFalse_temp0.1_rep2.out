To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them arriving in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies that the samples are related to prostate tissue. However, it does not directly indicate the sample type. Given the context, it seems the sample type is likely "biopsy," but it's not explicitly stated. Since it's not directly mentioned, one might lean towards "NA" for Not Available or directly stated type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the examination of prostate tissue and mentions observing "normal basal cells," which is typically indicative of benign tissue since basal cells are absent in prostate adenocarcinoma. It also talks about "suspicious formations" but concludes with a discussion on the reliability of staining rather than confirming malignancy. The presence of normal basal cells suggests the tissue is likely benign, so "Malignancy" could be considered as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It discusses the issue with immunological stainings and the observation of normal basal cells, which implies a benign condition. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" since Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tumors.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: The statement doesn't directly specify the sample type, so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: Given the presence of normal basal cells and the lack of a clear malignancy diagnosis, it should be considered as "no".
- **Gleason**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, it should be "NA".

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
