To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "invasive tumor tissue" and describes it as "malignant focus", which confirms that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grading is given as "4+3". Although the sum is not explicitly mentioned, it can be calculated as 7. The Gleason grade is therefore "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
