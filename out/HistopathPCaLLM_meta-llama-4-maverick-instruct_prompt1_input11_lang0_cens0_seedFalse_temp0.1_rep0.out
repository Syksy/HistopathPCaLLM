To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for prostatectomy is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed" and describes a "malignant focus in the apex and central lobe." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason grading of "4+3". Although it doesn't explicitly mention the sum, it is implied that the Gleason score is "4+3=7". Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement about prostate cancer, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
