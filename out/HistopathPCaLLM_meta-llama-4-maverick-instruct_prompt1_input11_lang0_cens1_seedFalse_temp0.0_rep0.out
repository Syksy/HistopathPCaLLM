To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue" and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a limited sample size, more indicative of a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, we'll have to make an educated guess. Given the information and the fact that it's not explicitly mentioned as RP or TURP, and considering the limited percentage of material investigated, we might lean towards "biopsy." However, it's not a clear-cut decision based on the text.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "prostate tissue" that "appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages." While it doesn't directly state the presence of malignancy, the mention of "Gleason scores" (though not assessed) implies a context where malignancy is being considered. However, the presence of malignancy isn't explicitly confirmed. The text does not directly state that the tissue is malignant or benign; it remains somewhat ambiguous. The mention of Gleason scores typically relates to prostate cancer assessment, suggesting a context where malignancy is a possibility. Yet, without a clear statement on malignancy, we must be cautious.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that these "could not be reliably assessed." This implies that while there is an indication of what the Gleason scores might be, they are not definitively reported. For the purpose of structuring the data, if the Gleason score is not reliably assessed or reported, it might be considered as not available or "NA."

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely is "biopsy" due to the limited material available for investigation.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm malignancy, so it could be considered "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the Gleason score could not be reliably assessed, it is "NA."

Thus, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given statement, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is made based on the available information and the specific requirements of the task.
