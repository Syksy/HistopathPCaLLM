To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about examining prostate tissue and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a limited sample size, more indicative of a biopsy. But, it doesn't explicitly state the sample type. Given the context, it seems like it could be a biopsy due to the limited amount of material examined. However, without a clear indication, one might lean towards "NA" (Not Available) due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes observing prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions fractions of Gleason scores 4 and 3. The mention of Gleason scores implies that there are malignant tumor findings since Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but indicates that their fractions "could not be reliably assessed." Despite this, it implies that a Gleason score is relevant, suggesting malignancy. However, it does not provide a definitive Gleason score or sum. For the purpose of structuring, since a specific Gleason score isn't provided and it's indicated that the assessment couldn't be reliably made, one might consider this as not having a clear "Gleason" score to report. However, given that the scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, a possible interpretation could be "4+3=7" if we were to assume the scores were being considered. Yet, the text explicitly states that the fractions could not be reliably assessed, which complicates this interpretation. Thus, strictly speaking, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" due to the lack of a definitive assessment.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (and noting that the sample doesn't explicitly provide multiple lesions to compare), could be represented as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This representation is based on the available information and the instructions provided:
- "Sampletype" is "NA" because the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned.
- "Malignancy" is "yes" due to the implication of malignant findings through the mention of Gleason scores.
- "Gleason" is "NA" because, despite mentioning Gleason scores 4 and 3, the statement indicates that a reliable assessment of their fractions couldn't be made.
