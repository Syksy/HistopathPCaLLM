To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about examining prostate tissue and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a limited sample size, more indicative of a biopsy. But, there's no explicit mention of the sample type. Given the context, it seems like it could be a biopsy due to the limited amount of material examined. However, without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" since we can't conclusively determine the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes observing prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions fractions of Gleason scores 4 and 3. The mention of Gleason scores implies that there is a malignant tumor finding since Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Although the statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3, it explicitly states that these "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, despite the implication of malignancy, the Gleason grade cannot be confidently reported. Hence, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" due to the lack of a reliable assessment.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't explicitly compare multiple lesions, the information given is used as is). The values are chosen based on the closest interpretation of the given text according to the allowed values for each field.
