To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue" and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a limited sample size, more indicative of a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, we'll have to make an educated guess. Given the information and the fact that it's not explicitly mentioned as RP or TURP, and considering the limited percentage of material investigated, we might lean towards "biopsy." However, it's not a straightforward conclusion.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "prostate tissue" forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions Gleason scores (4 and 3), which are terms typically used in the context of prostate cancer assessment. However, it does not explicitly state the presence of adenocarcinoma or malignancy. The mention of Gleason scores implies a suspicion or context of malignancy, but the statement does not directly confirm malignancy. The presence of "Gleason scores" is a strong hint towards a malignant context, but the conclusion about malignancy is not directly stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that the fractions of these scores "could not be reliably assessed." This implies that while there is a context suggesting malignancy (due to the mention of Gleason scores), the specific Gleason grade (in the form of major+minor=sum) is not provided due to the inability to assess it reliably.

Given these considerations:

- For "Sampletype," we'll choose "biopsy" based on the context provided, though it's not a definitive conclusion.
- For "Malignancy," despite the context suggesting a potential malignancy (mention of Gleason scores), the statement doesn't directly confirm malignancy. Thus, it might be more appropriate to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a direct statement on malignancy.
- For "Gleason," since the fractions of Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed, we should technically consider it as "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given statement, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers for the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't explicitly compare multiple lesions, the context provided is used to infer the required information). The values are chosen based on the closest interpretation of the given text against the allowed values for each field.
