To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue by electrosection or electrocautery. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." Thus, there were no malignant tumor findings, meaning the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no malignant tumor, and hence, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
