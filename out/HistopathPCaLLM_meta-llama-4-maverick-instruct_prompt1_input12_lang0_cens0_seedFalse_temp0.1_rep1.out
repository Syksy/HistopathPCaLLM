To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a specific medical procedure. "Electrosection shavings" is another term for the material obtained during a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the material is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade reported for malignant findings. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, so there's no issue of multiple lesions having different severities).
