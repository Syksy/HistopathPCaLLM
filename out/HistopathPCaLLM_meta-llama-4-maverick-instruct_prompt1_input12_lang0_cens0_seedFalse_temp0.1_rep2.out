To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a specific medical procedure. "Electrosection shavings" is another term for the material obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the material is classified as benign, there is no malignant tumor to grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
