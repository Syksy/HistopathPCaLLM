To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches" but does not directly indicate the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate cancer tissue," which could be obtained through various methods like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, so we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not clearly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grades or their sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since it's not mentioned.

Now, let's address the sample type more directly: The statement doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or another type. Given the information that the sample "has been started in eight batches," it could imply a larger sample possibly obtained through a surgical procedure. However, without explicit information, we should be cautious. Commonly, a sample being processed in multiple batches could be more indicative of a larger tissue sample like those from RP or TURP. However, without clear indication, and given the constraints of the allowed values, if we cannot definitively categorize it, we should consider it as "NA" for the sake of this task.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the task's requirements by providing a flat JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values. The "Sampletype" is "NA" due to the lack of explicit information about the sample type, "Malignancy" is "yes" because the statement confirms the presence of prostate cancer tissue, and "Gleason" is "NA" since the Gleason grade or its components are not mentioned.
