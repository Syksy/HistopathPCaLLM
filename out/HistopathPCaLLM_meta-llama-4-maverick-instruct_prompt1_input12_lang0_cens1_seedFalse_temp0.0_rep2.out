To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches" but does not directly indicate the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate cancer tissue," which could be related to various sample types like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, so we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not clearly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grades. It mentions that "high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue," suggesting that a detailed examination is pending or not completed. Therefore, we cannot determine the Gleason grade from the given information, and it should be considered as "NA."

Given the information and the instructions:

- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's "NA."
- Malignancy is "yes" because it mentions "prostate cancer tissue."
- Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not mentioned.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
