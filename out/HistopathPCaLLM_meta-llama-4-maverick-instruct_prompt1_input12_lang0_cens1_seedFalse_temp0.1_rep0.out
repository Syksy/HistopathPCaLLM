To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches" but does not directly specify the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate cancer tissue," which could be obtained through various methods like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, so we'll have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not clearly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grades or their sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since it's not mentioned.

Now, let's analyze the given text to infer the sample type:
- The text doesn't explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). It mentions the sample has been "started in eight batches," which could imply a significant amount of tissue, possibly suggesting RP or TURP. However, without explicit information, it's challenging to determine.

Given the information and the constraints:
- **Sample Type**: Since it's not explicitly mentioned and can't be confidently inferred, it could be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: "yes" because it mentions "prostate cancer tissue".
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" because there's no information provided about the Gleason grades.

Thus, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given statement.
