To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches" but does not directly indicate the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate cancer tissue," which could be obtained through various methods like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, so we'll have to deduce or directly infer it as "NA" if not clearly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grades or their sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" since it's not mentioned.

Now, let's address the sample type more directly. The statement doesn't explicitly state whether it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or another type. Given the information that the sample "has been started in eight batches," it suggests a significant amount of tissue was processed, which could be more indicative of a larger specimen like RP or TURP rather than a biopsy. However, without explicit information, the safest choice is "NA" for Sample type.

Thus, structuring the given information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information that can be reliably deduced from the given statement.
