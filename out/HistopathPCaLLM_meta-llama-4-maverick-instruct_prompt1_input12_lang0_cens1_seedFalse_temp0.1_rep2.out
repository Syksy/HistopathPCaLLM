To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches" but does not directly indicate the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate cancer tissue," which could be obtained through various methods like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, so we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not clearly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "prostate cancer tissue," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grades or their sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since it's not mentioned.

Now, let's determine the sample type more closely. The statement doesn't directly specify if it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or another type. It mentions the sample is "prostate cancer tissue" and has been processed in "eight batches," which could imply a larger sample possibly obtained from a surgical procedure like RP or TURP. However, without explicit information, we can't be certain. Given the lack of clear indication towards the sample type, the most appropriate answer for "Sampletype" would be "NA".

Thus, structuring the given information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information that can be reliably extracted from the given statement.
