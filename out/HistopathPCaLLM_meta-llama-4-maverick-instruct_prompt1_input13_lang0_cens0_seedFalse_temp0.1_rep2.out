To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the "biopsy" category.

2. **Malignancy**: It is stated that "In sample B carcinoma is observed," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason score as "5" and the "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)." The Gleason grade is typically represented as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it is given as "4+5=9," which matches the required format.

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned.
