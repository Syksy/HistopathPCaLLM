To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate..." but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that multiple samples are taken from different locations and sides of the prostate, and the mention of "sample B," it suggests a biopsy. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves the removal of the prostate gland, and Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) involves removing prostate tissue through the urethra, usually for relieving obstruction. The description best fits a biopsy due to the mention of sampling from different locations. Therefore, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "In sample B some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague." It also mentions that "This suspicious pattern includes enough material for inspection and assessment" and that "further verification is needed via consultation." The presence of "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" suggests a potential malignancy, but it is not definitively diagnosed as the statement concludes with "further verification is needed." However, the presence of suspicious findings leans towards a potential malignancy. Since it's not explicitly confirmed, one might argue it should be considered as "yes" due to the suspicious nature indicating potential malignancy, but given the uncertainty ("further verification is needed"), it could be debated. For the purpose of this task, we'll consider it as "yes" because the text implies a strong suspicion of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection" but does not specify a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it is not provided.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the task's requirements by providing a structured JSON output with the requested fields, based on the information available in the given statement.
