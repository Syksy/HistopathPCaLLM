To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that multiple samples are taken from different locations and sides of the prostate, and the mention of "sample B," it suggests a biopsy. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves the removal of the prostate gland, and Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) involves removing prostate tissue through the urethra, usually for relieving obstruction. The description best fits a biopsy due to the sampling nature. Thus, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some irregularities are observed" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B, which "warrant further inspection" and "further verification is needed via consultation." While this suggests that there are abnormal findings that could potentially be malignant, it does not confirm malignancy. The language used ("suspicious pattern," "warrant further inspection") implies uncertainty and a need for further evaluation, rather than a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, the statement does not conclusively indicate malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is not explicitly "yes" or "no" based on the given information, leaning towards "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection," indicating some abnormality but does not specify a Gleason score. The Gleason score is typically reported for diagnosed adenocarcinomas. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy and no Gleason grades are mentioned, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score is provided)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
