To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that multiple samples are taken from different locations and sides of the prostate, and considering typical medical practices, it's reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), as those procedures have different characteristics. Thus, we'll categorize it as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some irregularities are observed" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B, which suggests a potential malignancy or at least a need for further inspection to rule out malignancy. However, it explicitly states that "further verification is needed via consultation," implying that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy hasn't been made. Despite the suspicious findings, the text does not directly confirm malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" for malignancy. The most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" because the statement doesn't definitively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection" but does not specify any Gleason scores. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no information provided about the Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a structured answer in valid JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, sample B is noted as having irregularities), and not using nested structures.
