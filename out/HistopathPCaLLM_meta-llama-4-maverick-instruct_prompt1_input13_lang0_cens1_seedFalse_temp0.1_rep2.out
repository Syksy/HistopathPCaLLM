To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" being taken from "typical locations in the prostate," which is a common description for biopsy procedures. There's no explicit mention of it being a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." Since it's not explicitly stated, one might argue it could be "NA" for not available. However, given the context, we'll lean towards "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" in sample B, indicating a potential malignancy or at least a need for further inspection due to abnormal findings. However, it does not confirm malignancy, stating that "further verification is needed via consultation." Thus, while there's a suspicion, malignancy isn't confirmed. For the purpose of structuring, since it's not explicitly confirmed as malignant, we might consider it as not having confirmed malignant tumor findings, leaning towards "no" because it doesn't definitively state "yes." However, the ambiguity here is notable.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection" but does not specify Gleason scores. Thus, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it's not provided.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions with varying severity, it does mention one sample being suspicious), would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structuring is based on the available information and the cautious interpretation that the malignancy is not confirmed, and no Gleason grade is provided.
