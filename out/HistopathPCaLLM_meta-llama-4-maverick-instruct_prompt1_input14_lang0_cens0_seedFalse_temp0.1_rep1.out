To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." The term "prostatetectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is commonly known as Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "tumorous growth" and describes it as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma." This confirms that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with further details that the larger portion has a score of 3, approximately 60% in the findings. This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because the larger portion is score 3 and it is a common convention in pathology to list the most prevalent pattern first. Therefore, if the sum is 7 and the primary grade is 3, the secondary must be 4.

Thus, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
