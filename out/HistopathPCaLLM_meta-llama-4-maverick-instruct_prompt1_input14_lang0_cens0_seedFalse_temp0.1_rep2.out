To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." The term "prostatetectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is commonly known as Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "tumorous growth" and describes it as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma." This confirms that there were malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with further details that the larger portion has a score of 3, approximately 60% in the findings. This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because the larger portion is score 3 and it's a common practice to list the more prevalent pattern first. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion as per the given statement.
