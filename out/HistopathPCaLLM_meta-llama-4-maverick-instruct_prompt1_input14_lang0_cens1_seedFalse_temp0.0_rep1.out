To structure the given text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The text mentions "prostate tissue, prepared to be run on casettes following the normal routine" and discusses various samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), indicating it's a tissue sample. However, it doesn't directly state if it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The context suggests it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of sampling and the uncertainty about surgical margins and prostate capsule breach, which is more typical in a diagnostic setting rather than a post-surgical specimen. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The text mentions "some special patterns of cell growth are observed peripherally" and discusses the possibility of a Gleason score, which implies suspicion or consideration of malignancy. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The text suggests further investigation is needed and mentions a comparison to a "recent Gleason 7 score patient," indicating that while there's suspicion or discussion about malignancy, it's not explicitly confirmed in the provided statement. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not definitively stated, but there's an implication that it's being considered. The most accurate answer based on the information given is "NA" because it's not directly stated.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The text does not directly report a Gleason grade for the current patient but mentions a comparison to another patient with a "Gleason 7 score." Since the Gleason score for the patient in question is not provided, and the statement is about further investigation, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements, providing a straightforward answer to each of the three questions based on the information available in the statement.
