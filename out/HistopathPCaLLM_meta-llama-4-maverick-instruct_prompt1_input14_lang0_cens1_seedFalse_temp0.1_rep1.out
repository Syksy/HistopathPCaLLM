To structure the given text into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The text mentions "prostate tissue, prepared to be run on casettes following the normal routine" and discusses various samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), indicating it's a tissue sample. However, it doesn't directly state if it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The context suggests it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of sampling and the uncertainty about surgical margins and prostate capsule breach, which is more typical for a biopsy report. Thus, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The text mentions "some special patterns of cell growth are observed peripherally" and discusses the need for further histopathological investigation to rule out "mid-grade GG findings." This implies suspicion or uncertainty about malignancy rather than a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. However, it doesn't explicitly state that the findings are malignant or benign. The discussion about comparing the patient to another with a "Gleason 7 score" and the concern for "mid-grade GG findings" suggests a potential for malignancy but doesn't confirm it. Thus, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes" or "no," leaning towards "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The text does not directly report a Gleason grade for the current specimen. It mentions a comparison to a patient with a "Gleason 7 score" but does not state the Gleason score for the specimen in question. Thus, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since no Gleason score is reported for the specimen)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
