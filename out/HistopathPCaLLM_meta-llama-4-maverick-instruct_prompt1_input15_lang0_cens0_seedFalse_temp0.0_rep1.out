To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Typically, the Gleason score is reported as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason grades. Although it doesn't explicitly state the minor grade, we can infer that if the major is 4 and the sum is 8, the minor must be 4 as well, making it 4+4=8.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
