To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue material" being processed. The context suggests it could be a biopsy, but it's not explicitly stated. Since it's not directly mentioned, we might consider it as "NA" if we strictly follow the given information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it also indicates that this suspicion was "not based on any histopathology." The histopathological examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy due to the lack of representative material for Gleason grading or other markers. Thus, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because the examination was inconclusive.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not possible to determine it.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and using the allowed values. The result reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics, although in this case, the examination was inconclusive.
