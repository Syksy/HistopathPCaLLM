To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could imply a biopsy. There's no clear indication of it being RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, it seems most likely to be a "biopsy" due to the mention of processing tissue material and the uncertainty around Gleason grading, which is common in biopsy samples. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignancy through histopathology. It indicates that representative Gleason or other markers could not be determined, and potential findings need to be revised. Thus, while there's a suspicion of malignancy, it's not confirmed. Therefore, the malignancy status is not definitively "yes". Since there's a suspicion but no confirmation, and given the allowed values, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" because "yes" implies confirmation, and "no" implies a definitive absence of malignancy, which is also not stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the clinical notes suspected an adenocarcinoma with a Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this was not based on histopathology, and it was not possible to determine the Gleason grade from the sample. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not determined or confirmed through histopathological examination.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements by providing the sample type as "biopsy", indicating that malignancy was not confirmed ("NA"), and reporting the Gleason grade as "NA" since it was not determined through histopathology.
