To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could imply a biopsy. There's no clear indication that it's RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Since it's not explicitly stated, we have to infer or consider it as "NA" if it can't be determined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it also indicates that this suspicion was "not based on any histopathology" from the sample provided. It suggests that the histopathological examination was not conclusive regarding malignancy. Therefore, based on the histopathology report, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." It references a suspected Gleason sum based on clinical notes but not from the histopathological examination of the sample. Thus, the Gleason grade is not reported for this sample.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly state the sample type, so we'll consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The histopathological examination did not confirm malignancy; hence, it's considered "no" based on the histopathology report provided.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the Gleason grade could not be determined, it's "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data as per the instructions.
