To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could imply a biopsy. There's no clear indication of it being RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, it seems most likely to be a "biopsy" due to the mention of processing tissue material and the uncertainty around Gleason grading, which is common in biopsy samples. Thus, we'll consider it as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignancy through histopathology. It indicates that the suspicion needs to be confirmed or discarded in the next histologic examination. Therefore, based on the histopathological examination mentioned, malignancy is not confirmed. Hence, "Malignancy" should be considered as "no" because the statement does not definitively state the presence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." It references a suspected Gleason sum based on clinical notes but does not provide a Gleason grade from the histopathological examination. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" since it was not determined.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information provided in the statement according to the required format.
