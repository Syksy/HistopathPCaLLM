To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "carcinoma focuses" and describes characteristics of the carcinoma, such as Gleason grades. Thus, there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grade 3 and Gleason grade 4 components. It mentions that the "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 3 (major, since it covers more area) + 4 (minor) = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion described in the statement, following the required format and allowed values.
