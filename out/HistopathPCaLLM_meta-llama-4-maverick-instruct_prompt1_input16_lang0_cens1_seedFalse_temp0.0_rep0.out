To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the prostate" and refers to "the total sample material" without directly stating the type of sample. However, it implies that the material is from a biopsy or a similar procedure since it talks about "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and the need for manual grading on slides. The most likely sample type related to the context given (especially mentioning "prostate biopsy" is not directly stated but "suspicious foci" and the need for manual grading on slides) could be a "biopsy." However, the text does not explicitly state the sample type as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, we can infer it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of "suspicious foci" and the process described, but it's not a clear indication. Therefore, we might consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement refers to "suspicious foci" and various grades of cell differentiation, which implies that there is a suspicion of malignancy. However, it does not conclusively state that malignant tumor findings were present. The text indicates that the material "exhibits patterns that were closely inspected" and that there are "various grades of cell differentiation," suggesting a potential malignancy but not confirming it due to the limitations in digitalized images. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. The most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is inconclusive "due to resolution issues in the digitalized images" and suggests that grading should be done manually. It implies that there might be a need to assess for Gleason grades like "3+4 or 4+3" but does not provide a definitive Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not conclusively determined.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information provided in the statement, adhering to the allowed values for each field.
