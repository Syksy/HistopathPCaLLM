To address the given task, let's analyze the provided statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the prostate" and refers to "the total sample material" without directly stating the type of sample. However, it implies that the material is from a biopsy or a similar procedure since it talks about "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and the need for manual grading on slides. The most likely sample type related to the context given (especially mentioning "prostate biopsy" is not directly stated but "suspicious foci" and the need for manual grading on slides) is "biopsy." There's no clear mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and the context doesn't directly support these. Therefore, based on the information and the process described, we'll consider "biopsy" as the most plausible sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement refers to "suspicious foci" and various grades of cell differentiation, which suggests that there is a suspicion of malignancy. However, it does not conclusively state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The text indicates that the material "exhibits patterns that were closely inspected" and that there are "various grades of cell differentiation," which could imply a potential malignancy but is not definitive. The statement concludes that grading should be conducted manually, implying uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty, the context suggests a leaning towards potential malignancy due to the mention of "suspicious foci" and the discussion around grading, which is typically relevant for malignant tissues. However, the statement does not directly confirm malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images" and discusses the difficulty in assessing "mid-grade (i.e., 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation." This indicates that while there is a consideration for Gleason grading, the actual grade is not conclusively determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" due to the lack of a definitive grading.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the required format and provides the structured data based on the information given in the statement.
