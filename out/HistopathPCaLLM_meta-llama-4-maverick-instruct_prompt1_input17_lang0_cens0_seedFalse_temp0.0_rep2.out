To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and describes characteristics of the tumor such as Gleason grades and perineural invasion, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is "4+3". To determine the sum, we add the two numbers: 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion as required.
