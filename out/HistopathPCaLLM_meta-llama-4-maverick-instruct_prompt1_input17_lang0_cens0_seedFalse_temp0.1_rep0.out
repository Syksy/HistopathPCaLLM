To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP" which stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and describes characteristics like "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and "perineural invasion" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." These indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is "4+3=7". Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
