To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and mentions characteristics like "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3" and "perineural invasion" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is "4+3". Although it doesn't directly state the sum, based on standard practice, the sum would be 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion as required, in a non-nested JSON format.
