To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sites" and implies a detailed examination but does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses the processing and examination of prostate samples in a detailed manner, suggesting it is a significant sample. The term "RP" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, which is a larger sample that could be processed and examined in the detailed manner described. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another possibility for a significant sample, but the detailed differentiation between various parts (basis to apex, specific labeling of samples) is more suggestive of a prostatectomy specimen. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" due to the extensive description of sample processing and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate. Therefore, based on the context, "RP" seems a plausible sample type, though it's not explicitly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement hints at the possibility of assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" which implies that there could be malignant findings since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it also mentions the possibility of the material being "fully healthy," indicating that malignancy is not confirmed. The presence of Gleason grades is typically associated with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, but the statement does not directly confirm malignancy. It suggests an assessment is pending or will be discussed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions the possibility of Gleason grades between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score. It implies that an assessment for Gleason grading is possible or will be done, but it does not confirm a specific score.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "RP" due to the detailed description of the sample processing and differentiation between various prostate parts, though it's not a direct statement.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm malignancy; it suggests the possibility of malignancy and the assessment of Gleason grades but also mentions the material could be "fully healthy." Thus, malignancy is not confirmed.
- **Gleason Grade**: Not provided; the statement only discusses the possibility of assessing Gleason grades.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given instructions and focusing on the most severe lesion (though not directly identified) or the information available, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of direct information in the statement regarding malignancy and Gleason grade. The sample type is inferred based on the context provided.
