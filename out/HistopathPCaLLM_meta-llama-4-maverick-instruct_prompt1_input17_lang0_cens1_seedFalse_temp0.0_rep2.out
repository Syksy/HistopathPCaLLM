To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue sites" and the processing of samples (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O), which could imply a surgical specimen. The term "biopsy" is not explicitly mentioned, nor are "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) directly referenced. Given the context, it seems more likely to be a surgical specimen like RP due to the detailed description of the prostate's parts. However, without explicit mention, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because we cannot be certain.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" which implies the presence of malignant cells since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it does not directly state that malignant tumor findings were present; instead, it suggests the material "likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This indicates uncertainty and does not confirm malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement does not definitively say there are malignant findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions the possibility of Gleason scores between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score for a malignant finding. It implies that the assessment for Gleason grading is possible but hasn't been concluded. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as there's no definitive malignant diagnosis provided.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not providing nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, no lesion was definitively identified as malignant). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
