To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sites" and implies a detailed examination but does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses the processing and examination of prostate samples in a detailed manner, suggesting it is a significant sample. The term "RP" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen, which is a larger sample that could be processed and examined in the detailed manner described. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another possibility for a significant sample, but the detailed differentiation between various parts (basis to apex, specific labeling of samples) is more suggestive of a prostatectomy specimen. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" due to the extensive description of sample processing and the differentiation between various parts of the prostate. Thus, based on the context, "RP" seems a plausible sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions the possibility of "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" being present, which implies that there is a consideration for malignancy since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy, stating that it's to be assessed. The phrase "if the material is fully healthy" also suggests that the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy based on the information given; it seems to be pending assessment.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores between 3 to 5, indicating that if there is malignancy, the Gleason score could be within this range. However, it does not provide a specific Gleason score for a malignant finding. It implies that the assessment is to be done, suggesting that a definitive Gleason score is not available.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "RP" due to the detailed description of the sample processing and differentiation between various prostate parts.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm malignancy; hence, it should be considered as "NA" because the presence or absence of malignancy is not definitively stated.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide a specific Gleason score, it should be considered "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields and values based on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) described in the statement.
