To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostate tissue sites" and the processing of samples (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O), which could imply a surgical specimen. The term "biopsy" is not explicitly mentioned, nor are "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) directly referenced. Given the context, it seems more likely to be a surgical specimen like RP due to the detailed description of the prostate's parts. However, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. Since it's not directly stated, we might consider it as "NA" if we strictly follow the given text.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" which implies the presence of malignant cells since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it does not directly state that malignant tumor findings were present; instead, it suggests the material "likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This indicates uncertainty and does not confirm malignancy. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The statement leaves open the possibility of the material being "fully healthy," suggesting malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" because it's not definitively stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement discusses the possibility of assessing Gleason scores between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score for a malignant finding. Since it doesn't confirm the presence of cancer and doesn't provide a specific Gleason score, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not providing nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, no malignancy is confirmed). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
