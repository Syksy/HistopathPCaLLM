To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sites" and refers to samples labeled A-D, E-F, and G-N, indicating a detailed examination of prostate tissue. However, it doesn't directly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or another type. The context suggests a detailed pathological examination, which could be consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen given the detailed description of the prostate's anatomy (e.g., basis toward apex, right side vs. left side). However, the text doesn't explicitly state the sample type. Given the detailed anatomical description, it is more likely to be "RP". Thus, we'll consider "RP" as the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement hints at the possibility of assessing "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5" which implies the presence of malignant tissue since Gleason scores are used for prostate cancer. However, it also mentions the possibility of the material being "fully healthy." The presence of a discussion about Gleason grades suggests that there is a consideration for malignancy, but it does not directly confirm malignant findings. The statement is somewhat ambiguous regarding the final assessment of malignancy. However, the fact that Gleason grades are mentioned implies an expectation or possibility of malignancy. Still, the final determination is pending, as indicated by "The status update from the consensus will then be appended to this preliminary report." Thus, we can't conclusively determine malignancy from the given text, so we'll have to consider it as not definitively stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5 but does not provide a specific Gleason score for a malignant finding. It implies that the assessment is ongoing or pending. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific Gleason grade from the information provided.

Given these considerations:

- For "Sampletype", we'll choose "RP" based on the detailed anatomical description.
- For "Malignancy", since the statement doesn't definitively confirm malignancy and implies further assessment is needed, we'll choose "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement on malignancy.
- For "Gleason", since no specific Gleason score is provided and the statement is not definitive about malignancy, we'll choose "NA".

Thus, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the information available in the statement and adheres to the allowed values for each field.
