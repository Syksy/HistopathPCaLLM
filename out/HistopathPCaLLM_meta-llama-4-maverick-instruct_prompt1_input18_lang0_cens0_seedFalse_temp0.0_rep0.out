To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through 12 tissue blocks. The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in small chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma," which directly implies the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason sum as 7 and further details that the larger fraction has a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is composed of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 is the larger fraction and the sum is 7, the other grade must be 4). Therefore, the Gleason score can be deduced as "3+4=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
