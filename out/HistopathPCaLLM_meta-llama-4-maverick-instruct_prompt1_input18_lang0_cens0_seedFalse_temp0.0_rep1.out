To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through 12 tissue blocks. The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in small chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies the Gleason score is 7. Further, it's mentioned that the larger fraction has a stage 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area, suggesting the Gleason score can be broken down into 3 (major or minor) and another component to sum up to 7. If 3 is the larger fraction, it is likely the primary grade, making the secondary grade 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7). Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion described in the statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
