To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through multiple tissue blocks. This context suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) since it involves chippings and a shaving procedure, which is typical for TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, there are malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason sum is mentioned as 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because the larger fraction is grade 3 and it makes up the majority (60%) of the tumor, suggesting the other component is grade 4 to sum up to 7.

Therefore, structuring the information:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the larger fraction is grade 3 and the sum is 7, it implies the minor grade is 4. Hence, "3+4=7".

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
