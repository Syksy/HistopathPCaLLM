To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through 12 tissue blocks. The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in small chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Carcinoma refers to cancer, so there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." It implies the Gleason score is 7, and further details that the larger fraction has a Gleason grade of 3. Since the sum is 7 and one component is 3, the other must be 4. The statement doesn't directly give the major and minor components in the conventional sense used for Gleason scoring (where the primary/ major grade is the most prevalent), but it implies the primary grade is 3 (since it's the larger fraction) and the secondary/minor grade is 4. Thus, the Gleason score can be represented as "3+4=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
