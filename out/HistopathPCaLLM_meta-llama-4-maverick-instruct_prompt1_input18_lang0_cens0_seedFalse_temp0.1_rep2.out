To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through 12 tissue blocks. The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a surgical procedure where prostate tissue is removed in small chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason sum, stating it is 7, with the larger fraction having a Gleason grade of 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is made up of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 is the larger fraction and the sum is 7, the other grade must be 4). Therefore, the Gleason score can be deduced as "3+4=7".

Given this analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured fields based on the information extracted from the given histopathological statement.
