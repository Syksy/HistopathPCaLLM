To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches." It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's processed in multiple tissue batches and mentions "prostate related procedures," we can infer it's likely a biopsy. However, without explicit information, one might lean towards "NA" due to the lack of direct mention. Yet, considering common practices and the context, "biopsy" seems a plausible inference.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction would require further inspection" and "the smaller portion that warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above." This implies suspicion of malignancy but not a definitive diagnosis. However, the presence of a suspicious area that "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above" leans towards a potential malignancy. Thus, the answer could be considered as "yes" due to the implication of potential malignancy (ISUP GG 1 or above suggests a Gleason Grade that is associated with malignancy).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group." This directly implies that a Gleason Grade or ISUP Grade Group cannot be assigned due to the small size of the suspicious area. Therefore, the Gleason Grade should be considered as "NA" because it's not provided or determinable.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the inference that the sample is likely a biopsy due to the context, the presence of a potentially malignant lesion (though not definitively diagnosed), and the inability to determine the Gleason Grade due to the small size of the suspicious area.
