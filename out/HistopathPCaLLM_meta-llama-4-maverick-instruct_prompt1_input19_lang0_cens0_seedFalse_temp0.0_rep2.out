To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in sample 4, so the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: For sample 4, which is malignant, the Gleason grades are given as 3 (approx 90%) and 4 (10%). The major grade is 3, and the minor grade is 4, resulting in a sum of 3+4=7.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case), and adheres to the specified format and allowed values.
