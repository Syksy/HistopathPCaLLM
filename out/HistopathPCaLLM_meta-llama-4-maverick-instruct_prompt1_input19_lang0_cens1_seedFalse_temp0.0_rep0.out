To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly state the sample type. However, it refers to samples being "divided into 4 batches" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length" in the context of sample 4. The term "cylinder" is often associated with biopsy samples. Thus, we can infer that the sample type is likely "biopsy." Since it's the most specific information available, we'll use it.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is mentioned that cell architectures "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and that it is "possibly malignant." However, it also states that it is "uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue." Despite the uncertainty, sample 4 is the most severe lesion mentioned and has the potential for malignancy. Therefore, we will consider it as having malignant tumor findings because it's the most severe case and the statement leans towards the possibility of malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Since there's no Gleason grade mentioned for the potentially malignant sample (sample 4), and given that Gleason grading is typically applied to malignant prostate tissue, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because it's not provided.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the provided statement. The sample type is inferred to be a biopsy, there are potential malignant findings in the most severe lesion (sample 4), and no Gleason grade is reported.
