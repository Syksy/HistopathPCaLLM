To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly state the sample type. However, it refers to samples being "divided into 4 batches" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length" in the context of sample 4. The mention of "cylinder's length" suggests that the sample is likely a biopsy, as biopsies often involve taking cylindrical samples of tissue.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is mentioned that cell architectures "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and that it is "possibly malignant." However, it also states that it is "uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue." The uncertainty and the fact that a verification step is suggested before proceeding further into histopathology imply that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy has not been made.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - There is no mention of Gleason grades in the statement. The Gleason grade is typically used for diagnosing and assessing the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide Gleason grades, this information is not available.

Based on the analysis:

- The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy" due to the mention of a "cylinder's length."
- Malignancy is not confirmed; the statement indicates "possibly malignant" but with significant uncertainty and a need for further verification. Thus, it cannot be definitively classified as "yes" for malignancy. The most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the uncertainty and lack of a definitive diagnosis.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grades are mentioned.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
