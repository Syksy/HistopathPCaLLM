To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly state the sample type. However, it refers to samples being "divided into 4 batches" and mentions "the whole cylinder's length" in the context of sample 4. The term "cylinder" is often associated with biopsy samples. Thus, we can infer that the sample type is likely "biopsy." Since it's the most plausible option based on the context, we'll consider it as "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes samples 2 and 3 as "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it mentions cell architectures that "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and notes the uncertainty of whether it's "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)." Despite the uncertainty and the possibility of malignancy, the statement does not confirm malignant tumor findings. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't definitively confirm or rule out malignancy for sample 4, and samples 1, 2, and 3 are either unrepresentative or benign.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for any of the samples. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades, and given that the malignancy is not confirmed, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case, as it's the one with potential abnormality) would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and the instructions provided, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4) and not using nested structures.
