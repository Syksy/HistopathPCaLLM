To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed." This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer to malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the growth observed is "benign-like" and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate cancer.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no malignancy and no Gleason score).
