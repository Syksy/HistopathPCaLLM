To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that it's inspecting "representative prostate cancer samples," it's likely referring to a biopsy, as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) and TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are specific procedures. Biopsy is a more general term that could apply to various sampling methods for cancer diagnosis. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP or TURP and given that biopsy is a common method for initial assessment, we'll consider it as "biopsy" for the purpose of this task.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples," which directly implies the presence of malignancy. However, it also states that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. Despite the mention of "prostate cancer samples," the inconclusive nature regarding malignancy might suggest that the diagnosis isn't definitive. Still, the presence of "prostate cancer samples" leans towards malignancy being "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a conclusive Gleason grade was not provided due to the mentioned artefacts and the need for further inspection. Thus, we cannot determine a specific Gleason grade from this statement, making it "NA" for the purpose of structuring.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the information provided and the instructions to structure the data. The sample type is inferred as "biopsy" due to the context, malignancy is considered "yes" due to the mention of "prostate cancer samples," and Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement does not provide a conclusive Gleason grade.
