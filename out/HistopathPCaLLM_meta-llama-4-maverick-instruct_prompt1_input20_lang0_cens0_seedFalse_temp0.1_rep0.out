To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatectomy is often abbreviated as "RP" in medical terminology, which stands for Radical Prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in the sample, as it is mentioned that "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Thus, there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades for different parts of the sample. For the apex, it's "3+4", and for the basis, it's "4+4". Since "4+4" is more severe than "3+4" (because 8 is greater than 7), we consider the Gleason grade from the basis, which is "4+4=8". Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
