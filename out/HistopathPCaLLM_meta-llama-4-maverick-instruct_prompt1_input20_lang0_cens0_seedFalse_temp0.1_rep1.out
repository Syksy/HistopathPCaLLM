To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatectomy is often abbreviated as "RP" in medical terminology, which stands for Radical Prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades for two different parts of the sample. For the apex, it's "3+4", and for the basis, it's "4+4". Since "4+4" is more severe than "3+4" (because 8 is greater than 7), we consider "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

- Sample type: "RP"
- Malignancy: "yes"
- Gleason grade: "4+4=8"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
