To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from different regions (apex, middle, and basis). It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the sample is from a biopsy since it mentions "re-sampled" later on, suggesting an initial sampling procedure. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, or TURP) isn't directly stated. Since "RP" typically refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen and "TURP" refers to a transurethral resection of the prostate, and the text doesn't directly support these interpretations, and given that the text implies sampling, "biopsy" seems the most plausible.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that examination for possible adenocarcinoma is considered "impossible due to the therapies given in the region" and that the prostate tissue samples have been "highly affected." This implies that there is uncertainty or inability to assess malignancy due to prior treatments, rather than a clear indication of malignancy or benignancy. Thus, it leans towards "NA" as the malignancy status is not determinable.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions a hypothetical Gleason score (3+4) but clearly indicates that assessing Gleason grade is not feasible due to the effects of previous therapies on the tissue. Therefore, there is no reported Gleason grade, making "NA" the appropriate response.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: Given the context, "biopsy" is the most appropriate choice.
- **Malignancy**: Since the statement doesn't confirm malignancy due to the effects of previous treatments, "NA" is the most suitable answer.
- **Gleason**: The Gleason grade is not reported due to the condition of the samples; hence, "NA" is appropriate.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
