To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided:

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from different regions (apex, middle, and basis). It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the sample is from a biopsy since it mentions "re-sampled" later, indicating an initial sampling procedure likely to be a biopsy.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is considered but is "impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that there is a context where adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) is being considered or suspected, but the current samples are not conclusive due to prior treatments.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions a hypothetical Gleason grade (3+4) but emphasizes that assessing Gleason grade is currently impossible due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue samples. Thus, there is no actual reported Gleason grade from the current samples.

Given these observations:

- **Sample type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" based on the context provided.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not conclusively confirm malignancy due to the impact of previous therapies on the samples. However, it discusses the possibility of adenocarcinoma, suggesting a context where malignancy is considered. Since it's not directly stated as "yes" or "no" due to the limitations in assessment, and given the constraints of allowed values, we should lean towards "NA" as the samples are not conclusive for malignancy.
- **Gleason grade**: The Gleason grade is not reported for the samples due to the effects of previous therapies. The mention of a hypothetical Gleason grade (3+4) is not considered an actual report.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the given statement and the constraints provided.
