To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided:

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples" divided into six main sets from different regions (apex, middle, and basis). It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the sample is from a biopsy since it mentions "re-sampled" later, implying an initial sampling. However, the exact type isn't directly stated, and "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is less likely given the context of sampling and potential for re-sampling. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a possibility but not directly indicated. The statement implies a sampling that is not necessarily "RP." Given the information and the allowed values, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is considered but is "impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that while adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) is a consideration, the current samples cannot be used to confirm or deny its presence due to prior treatments affecting cell morphology. Thus, it's not directly stated as "yes" or "no" for malignancy. Given the context and the allowed values, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions a "hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" could be found, implying that no actual Gleason grade was determined or reported due to the reasons mentioned (treatments affecting cell morphology). Thus, the Gleason grade is not provided, and given the context, "NA" is the most appropriate answer.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements: it represents the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses the challenges in assessing the prostate tissue), does not consist of nested structures, and provides answers in the specified allowed values.
