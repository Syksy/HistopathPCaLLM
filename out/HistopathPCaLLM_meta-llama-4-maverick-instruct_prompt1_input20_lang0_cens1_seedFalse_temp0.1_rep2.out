To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue samples" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples" without specifying a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and the context suggests a biopsy due to the mention of sampling from different regions (apex, middle, basis). Thus, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that examination for possible adenocarcinoma is mentioned but concludes that it's "impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that there is uncertainty or difficulty in assessing malignancy due to prior treatments. However, it does not directly state the presence or absence of malignancy. The text leans towards suggesting that a definitive assessment of adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) cannot be made. Therefore, we might consider "Malignancy" as "NA" due to the inability to assess.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement hypothetically mentions a "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clearly indicates that assessing Gleason grade is not feasible due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue. Thus, the Gleason grade is not actually reported for any observed tumor. Hence, "Gleason" should be considered "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation of the given statement according to the instructions.
