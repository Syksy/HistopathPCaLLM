To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a specific type of sample. "Prostate chippings" is commonly associated with the procedure "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and mentions "tumor-like tissue", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grading as "5" being the most common and "4" as the second most common. Therefore, the Gleason score can be represented as "5+4=9".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
