To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a specific type of sample. "Prostate chippings" is commonly associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves the removal of prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and mentions that "roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer should be "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades, mentioning "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 5 (major) + 4 (minor) = 9. Thus, the Gleason grade should be structured as "5+4=9".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the instructions, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
