To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology." This indicates that the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context (fragments being put to histology and the mention of prostate), it is likely referring to a biopsy or possibly a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve removing tissue for examination. The term "fragments" could be associated with either, but "TURP" typically results in multiple fragments. However, without a clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or explicitly stating "biopsy" or "TURP," and considering the context, we might lean towards "TURP" or "biopsy." The statement doesn't directly support "RP" as it's not typically described as "fragments." Given the information and the allowed values, if we had to choose, "TURP" seems plausible due to the mention of "fragments," but it's not a definitive identification.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of a tumor, but it also states that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." This implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. It doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions that "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns," indicating that a detailed analysis like Gleason grading is not possible.

Given these observations:
- For "Sampletype," we might consider "TURP" due to the mention of "fragments," but it's not a strong indication. The most cautious choice, given the uncertainty, is "NA" because the text doesn't directly state the sample type.
- For "Malignancy," since the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy due to the sample quality, the most appropriate answer is "NA."
- For "Gleason," since there's no Gleason grade provided or assessable due to the sample quality issues, it's "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information in the provided statement regarding the required fields.
