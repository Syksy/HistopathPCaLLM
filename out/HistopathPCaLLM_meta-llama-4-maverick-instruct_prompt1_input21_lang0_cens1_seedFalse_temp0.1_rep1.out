To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology." This indicates that the sample is from a prostate procedure. Although it doesn't directly state the type, the fact that it's "extracted prostate material" and mentions fragments being put to histology suggests it's likely a biopsy or possibly a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated. Given the context and the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"), and since "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves a larger specimen and the statement talks about "fragments," we can lean towards either "biopsy" or "TURP." The description of "several fragments" could fit either, but "TURP" often results in multiple fragments. Without a clear indication, the most conservative choice based on the information given and the fact that it's not clearly "RP," would be to consider it as "TURP" or "biopsy." However, the statement does not clearly indicate it is a biopsy either. Since the exact nature isn't clear and it doesn't directly state it's a biopsy, and given that TURP is a plausible interpretation due to the mention of "several fragments," we might consider it as "TURP." However, the lack of a definitive statement about the procedure type makes this a bit speculative.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of malignancy in certain contexts, but it also talks about "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material." This implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. There's no clear statement confirming malignancy, and the overall tone suggests uncertainty. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy due to the limitations in assessing the sample. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions difficulties in assessing cell differentiation patterns due to "technical noise," implying that a Gleason score could not be reliably determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly indicate multiple lesions or their severity), would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the available information and the constraints provided. Note that "TURP" is chosen here due to the context suggesting multiple fragments, but it's acknowledged that the sample type isn't explicitly stated.
