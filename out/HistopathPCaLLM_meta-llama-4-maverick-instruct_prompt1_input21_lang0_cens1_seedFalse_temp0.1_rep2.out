To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology." This indicates that the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context (fragments being put to histology and the mention of prostate), it is likely referring to a biopsy or possibly a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve removing tissue for examination. However, "TURP" is more associated with larger tissue fragments and is often used in the context of relieving urinary obstruction. The description of "several fragments" could fit either biopsy or TURP, but the lack of specific mention of chips or fragments typical of TURP and the context of histological examination leans more towards a biopsy. Therefore, we'll consider it as "biopsy" for the sake of this task, acknowledging that without more specific information, this is an educated guess.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be indicative of a neoplastic process, but it also mentions that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." This implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy is challenging due to the quality of the sample. However, it does not directly state that the findings were malignant or benign. The presence of "carpet-like growth" might suggest a suspicion or indication towards a neoplastic process, but the overall assessment is confounded by technical issues. Since it doesn't directly confirm malignancy and given the uncertainty, one might be inclined to say "NA". However, the context suggests an issue that could be related to malignancy, but it's not conclusive.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions that "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns," which implies that a detailed analysis like Gleason grading was not possible. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions or their severity) and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the information available and the constraints provided in the task. The sample type is inferred as "biopsy" based on the context, malignancy is marked as "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement on malignancy, and Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not reported or assessable.
