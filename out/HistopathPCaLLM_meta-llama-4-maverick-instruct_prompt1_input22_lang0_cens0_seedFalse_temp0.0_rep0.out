To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments "exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," and there's mention of "cancerous growth." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason scores mentioned are 3 and 4. The statement does not explicitly provide the sum, but based on standard practice, it should be calculated as 3+4=7. The Gleason grade should be reported in the format "major+minor=sum." Since the primary score is 3 and the secondary is 4, it should be represented as "3+4=7."

Given that the left side is malignant and has a Gleason score, and it's more severe than the right side (which is benign), the structured data should reflect the findings from the left side.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (the left side in this case).
