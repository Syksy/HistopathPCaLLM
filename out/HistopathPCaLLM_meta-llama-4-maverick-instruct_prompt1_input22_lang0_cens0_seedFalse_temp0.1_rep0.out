To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments exhibit "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason scores mentioned are 3 and 4. The statement does not explicitly provide the sum, but based on standard practice, it should be "3+4=7." Since the left side is malignant and has a Gleason score, and it's more severe than the right side (which is benign), we use the Gleason score from the left side.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (the left side in this case).
