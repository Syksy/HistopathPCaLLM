To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments exhibit "carcinoma tissue structures" and mentions "cancerous growth," indicating the presence of malignancy. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason scores mentioned are 3 and 4. The statement does not explicitly provide the sum, but based on standard practice, it should be "3+4=7." Since the left side is malignant and has a Gleason score, and it's considered the more severe lesion compared to the benign right side, we use this information.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the provided histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
