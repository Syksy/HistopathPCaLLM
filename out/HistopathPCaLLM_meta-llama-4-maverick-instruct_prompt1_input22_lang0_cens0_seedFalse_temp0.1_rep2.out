To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments exhibit "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason scores for the malignant tissue on the left side, mentioning "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." This implies the Gleason grade is "3+4=7." Since the task is to report the most severe lesion and the left side is malignant with a reported Gleason score, we will use this information.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the most severe lesion described in the statement.
