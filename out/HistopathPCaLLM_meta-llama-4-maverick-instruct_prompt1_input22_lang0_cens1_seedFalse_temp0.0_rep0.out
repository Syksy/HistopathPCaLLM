To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context of "tissue sampling material" and the description of fragments, it is most likely referring to a "biopsy." TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves larger tissue fragments and is often used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but the term "biopsy" is more commonly associated with needle biopsies which provide smaller tissue samples. However, without explicit mention, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the context of sampling. RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical removal of the prostate and is not a sampling method per se but a therapeutic procedure. The description doesn't fit an RP specimen as it's not a whole gland removal description.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult." It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates that despite some atypical features, the presence of malignancy couldn't be confirmed due to the quality and nature of the samples.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement directly mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult and implies that a definitive assessment of malignancy or Gleason grading cannot be made.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the context provided.
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that malignancy could not be assessed, so it leans towards "NA" (Not Available or Not Assessable) rather than a definitive "yes" or "no" because the assessment was inconclusive.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample couldn't be assessed for malignancy and Gleason grading, it should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and provides the structured data as requested.
