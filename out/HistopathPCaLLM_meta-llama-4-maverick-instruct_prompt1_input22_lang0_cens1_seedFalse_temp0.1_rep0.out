To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context of "tissue sampling material" and the description of fragments, it is most likely referring to a "biopsy." TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves larger tissue fragments and is often used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but the term "biopsy" is more commonly associated with needle biopsies which provide smaller tissue samples. However, without explicit mention, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the context of sampling. RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical removal of the prostate gland and is not a sampling method per se but a therapeutic procedure. Given the description, "biopsy" seems the most plausible.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. It also mentions the need for "proof-checking... that the material truly originates from prostate" and assessing if the samples "have not been contaminated." However, it does not directly state the presence or absence of malignancy but implies uncertainty due to the sample's condition and variability. The presence of "chronic inflammation" is noted, but malignancy is not confirmed. The statement concludes that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed," indicating that a determination of malignancy could not be made.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult," and due to the highly fragmented and varying nature of the samples, they "cannot be assessed for malignancies." Thus, a Gleason score is not provided.

Based on the analysis:
- The **Sample Type** is likely "biopsy" due to the context provided.
- **Malignancy** cannot be determined ("NA") because the statement concludes that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies.
- The **Gleason Grade** is "NA" since the statement does not provide a Gleason score due to the difficulty and uncertainty in assessing the samples.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
