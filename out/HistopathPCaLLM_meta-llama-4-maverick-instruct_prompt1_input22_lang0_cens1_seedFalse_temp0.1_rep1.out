To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's describing fragmented tissue samples from both sides of the prostate and mentioning specific lengths, this is indicative of a biopsy. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves larger tissue fragments and is often used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical removal of the prostate and is not typically described in terms of fragmented samples in this manner. Therefore, the most likely sample type based on the description is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score is difficult. It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates uncertainty regarding malignancy due to the sample's condition and quality, rather than a definitive statement of benignancy or malignancy. However, the presence of an "abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" could suggest a potential concern for malignancy or at least an abnormal finding. Despite this, the explicit statement that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" leans towards an inability to determine malignancy status rather than confirming it. Thus, the most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates that a Gleason score could not be reliably determined, which aligns with the answer "NA" for the Gleason grade, as it's not provided or determinable from the given information.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the required format and provides the structured data based on the analysis of the given statement.
