To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate" which indicates the sample is from a radical prostatectomy (RP). So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", indicating the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4 (60%)" as the most common, followed by "stage 5 (approx 30%)", and a tertiary grade of "class 3" with the least area. The conclusion directly states "Gleason-score sum 9", and it is implied that the major and minor grades are 5 and 4, respectively, summing up to 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "5+4=9".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
