To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4 (60%)" as the most common, followed by "stage 5 (approx 30%)" as the second most common. It also mentions a tertiary grade of "class 3" but notes it is "diminishingly small." The Gleason score sum is directly stated as "9" with the grade group being 5. The major and minor Gleason grades are 4 and 5 (or vice versa based on the percentages given), and their sum equals 9. The statement implies the Gleason score is "5+4=9" because it mentions stage 5 as the second most common after stage 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
