To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate." Prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4 (60%)" as the most common, followed by "stage 5 (approx 30%)" as the second most common. It also mentions a "tertiary grade with the least area, class 3," but for Gleason scoring, the tertiary component is not typically included in the basic Gleason score formula. The statement directly provides the "Gleason-score sum 9," which corresponds to the major and minor grades. Since the major grade is 5 and the minor is 4 (or vice versa, but typically the higher grade is considered the major), their sum equals 9. The Gleason score is thus represented as "5+4=9".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
