To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate" which indicates the sample type is from a radical prostatectomy (RP).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma" indicating the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4 (60%)" as the most common, "stage 5 (approx 30% proportion)" as the second most common, and a tertiary grade of "class 3" with the least area. The Gleason score sum is directly stated as "9", with the major and minor grades being 5 and 4, respectively, as inferred from the description (since the most prevalent is grade 4 and the second most is grade 5). The statement "Gleason-score sum 9" directly supports this, and it is typical to represent this as "5+4=9" for a Gleason score.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
