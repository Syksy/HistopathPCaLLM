To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and later refers to "the sample is to be reprocessed." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies that a sample has already been taken and is being further investigated or reprocessed. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the type of the original sample. Therefore, we have to infer or directly state "NA" if not clearly mentioned. Since the original sample type isn't directly stated, we'll have to consider it as "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings." Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer, implying malignancy. However, the current conclusion is about reprocessing the sample to validate initial suspicions rather than confirming malignancy directly from the given statement. Still, the mention of Gleason grade in the context implies that there was a suspicion or indication of malignancy. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignancy due to the context of Gleason grading.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to "potential Gleason 3 findings" but does not provide a complete Gleason score (which typically includes a major and minor grade and their sum). It doesn't directly state the Gleason score for the current sample but mentions a prior report. For structuring, we need to focus on the most severe lesion and the information directly available or implied. Since it doesn't give a complete Gleason score but implies a score involving "3", and there's no other more severe lesion's Gleason score provided, we'll have to make do with what's available. However, the instructions require a "major+minor=sum" format. The statement doesn't directly fulfill this, and since it's not a definitive diagnosis but rather a potential finding, it poses a challenge. Still, we can infer that if Gleason 3 was considered, a possible score could be "3+3=6" as a minimal interpretation, but this is not directly stated.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: "NA" because it's not directly stated.
- **Malignancy**: "yes" due to the context of Gleason grading and suspicion of malignancy.
- **Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't directly provide a complete Gleason score. However, it implies a potential malignancy with a Gleason grade of "3". For the sake of providing an answer and following the format, one might be tempted to infer "3+3=6" as it's the most straightforward interpretation involving "3". However, this isn't directly stated, and the statement is about reprocessing to validate suspicions rather than confirming a Gleason score.

Therefore, a strict interpretation based on the given data and avoiding assumptions beyond what's directly stated or clearly implied would result in:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the exact Gleason score isn't confirmed or directly stated for the sample in question, and we're focusing on the information directly available. 

However, if one were to provide a more interpretive answer based on the context (and this is a bit of a stretch given the instructions), they might consider the malignancy context and the Gleason "3" mention. Still, the most accurate representation based on the provided instructions and avoiding over-interpretation is the one provided above.
