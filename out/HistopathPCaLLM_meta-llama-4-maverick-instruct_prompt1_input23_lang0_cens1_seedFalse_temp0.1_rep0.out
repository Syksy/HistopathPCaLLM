To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and later refers to reprocessing the sample with a focus on the apex. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies that a sample has already been taken and is being further investigated. However, it doesn't specify the original sample type directly. Since it mentions "ultrasound report and palpation" and the context is prostate cancer histopathology, it's likely referring to a biopsy. However, the exact original sample type isn't clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Given the context and the fact that it's being reprocessed for further investigation, if we had to choose, "biopsy" might be a plausible guess due to the mention of ultrasound, which is commonly used to guide prostate biopsies. However, the statement doesn't directly confirm this, so a more cautious approach would be to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior incomplete report of the sampled apex. The mention of "Gleason" implies a context of prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma), as Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer. Therefore, there are indications of malignant tumor findings ("yes") because Gleason grading is associated with prostate cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to "potential Gleason 3 findings" but doesn't provide a complete Gleason score (which typically includes a primary and secondary grade, e.g., 3+4=7). It implies a possible Gleason score involving a grade of 3 but doesn't give a complete score. For the purpose of structuring, since it doesn't provide a complete Gleason score and is discussing a potential finding rather than a confirmed diagnosis, one might be inclined to consider it as not having a definitive Gleason score to report. However, since it directly mentions a Gleason grade (albeit incompletely), and we're focusing on the most severe lesion, we still need to decide based on available information. The statement is not conclusive about the final Gleason score.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly state the sample type, so we'll consider it "NA".
- **Malignancy**: Since there's a mention of "Gleason 3 findings", it implies malignancy, so "yes".
- **Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't provide a complete Gleason score. It only mentions "Gleason 3" without a complete score. For the purpose of this task, we'll treat it as "NA" because it doesn't provide a sum or both the major and minor grades.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is based on the information provided and the constraints of the allowed values for each field.
