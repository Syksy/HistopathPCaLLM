To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and "the sample is to be reprocessed." It implies that a sample has been taken, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions "ultrasound report and palpation," which are commonly associated with biopsy procedures. There's no clear indication that it's RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement does not directly confirm malignant tumor findings in the current sample. It mentions a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings," which suggests there were suspicions or indications of malignancy (since Gleason score is used for prostate cancer), but it does not confirm malignancy in the current sample. The conclusion is to "validate the initial suspicions," implying that the malignancy is not confirmed in the statement's context. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the statement doesn't directly report malignant findings; it's about reprocessing to validate suspicions.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior report but does not confirm the Gleason score for the current sample. It is planning to reprocess the sample to validate initial suspicions, which included a Gleason score. Since the statement does not directly report a confirmed Gleason score for the sample in question, and given that the task is to report on the most severe lesion and the statement is not conclusive about the current sample's malignancy or Gleason score, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements by providing a flat structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
