To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation" and later refers to "the sample is to be reprocessed." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies that a sample has already been taken and is being further investigated or reprocessed. However, it doesn't explicitly mention the type of the original sample. Since there's no clear indication of the sample type being "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and given that the statement doesn't directly relate to any of these procedures explicitly, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA" due to the lack of direct information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings." Gleason scores are used to grade prostate cancer, and a Gleason score of 3 implies malignant tumor findings. However, the current sample being discussed is not confirmed to have malignancy; it's being reprocessed to "validate the initial suspicions." Thus, while there's a suspicion or a prior report suggesting potential malignancy, the current statement does not confirm malignant findings in the sample being reprocessed. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" because the statement is about a sample being reprocessed and not directly confirming malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement refers to a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings." However, it does not provide a complete Gleason score for the sample being discussed (i.e., it doesn't give both the major and minor grades and their sum). The mention of "Gleason 3" is from a prior report and not a confirmed finding for the sample in question. Therefore, the Gleason grade for the sample being reprocessed isn't confirmed or fully reported, making "NA" the most appropriate response.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the lack of definitive information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided statement.
