To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which clearly suggests that there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Although it doesn't explicitly state the major and minor grades, it implies a sum of 8, which is typically represented as either 4+4=8 (since it's not specifying different grades, it suggests that both major and minor are likely the same). However, given the information and the format required, we can infer that the Gleason score is 4+4=8 because it mentions a sum of 8 without specifying different grades for major and minor.

Therefore, structuring the given information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
