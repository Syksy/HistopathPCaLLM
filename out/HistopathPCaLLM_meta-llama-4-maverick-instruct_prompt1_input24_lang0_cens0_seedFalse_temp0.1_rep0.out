To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates the sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which signifies that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Although it doesn't explicitly state the major and minor grades, it implies a sum of 8. A common combination for a sum of 8 is "4+4=8." However, since the statement initially mentions "Gleason 4," we might infer that one of the grades is 4. Without explicit major and minor grades but knowing that the sum is 8 and one component is 4, a plausible Gleason score could be "4+4=8." 

Given the information and the requirement to provide the most severe lesion's details, we will structure the data as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the given histopathological statement.
