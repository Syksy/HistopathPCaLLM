To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which signifies that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and later states "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." Although it doesn't explicitly state the major and minor grades, it implies a sum of 8, which is typically represented as either "3+5=8" or "4+4=8" or "5+3=8". Given that it initially mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth," one might infer that the tumor is at least "4+4=8". Without further detail, and assuming the most straightforward interpretation where the Gleason score is directly mentioned as summing to 8, we can represent this as "4+4=8" for the purpose of this task.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
