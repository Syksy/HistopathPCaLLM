To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "biopsies" corresponds to "biopsy," "radical prostatectomies" corresponds to "RP," and "shavings" can be interpreted as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, it does not specify a single sample type for a particular lesion. Since the task is to return the results from the most severe lesion and the statement discusses multiple types of samples collectively, we'll have to infer or directly state "NA" if not explicitly mentioned for a specific case. The statement doesn't directly link a specific sample type to a malignant or severe lesion. Thus, we might consider "NA" for sample type due to the lack of specificity to a single severe lesion.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement initially mentions that the samples were "post-benign diagnosis," indicating that the initial diagnosis was benign. It then discusses the re-evaluation and upgrading of some cases to Gleason scores corresponding to malignant findings (e.g., Gleason 3+3 or 3+4). This implies that there were malignant tumor findings in some cases. However, it does not directly state that the most severe lesion was malignant in a straightforward manner. The presence of upgrading to Gleason scores like 3+3 or 3+4 indicates malignancy in some cases. So, we can infer "yes" for malignancy for the cases that were upgraded.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions upgrading to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" and "Gleason 6." Gleason 3+3=6 is the most specific malignant grade mentioned, and "Gleason 6" is a common representation for 3+3=6. The most severe lesion mentioned is "3+4," which equals 7. So, the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "3+4=7."

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion:

- **Sample Type**: Since the statement doesn't directly link the most severe lesion to a specific sample type, and given the collective nature of the samples discussed, we'll consider "NA" for this field due to the lack of direct association.
  
- **Malignancy**: The presence of malignant findings is confirmed through the upgrading to Gleason scores indicative of malignancy, so "yes."

- **Gleason Grade**: The most severe lesion is associated with a Gleason score of "3+4=7."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
