To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step according to the required structured fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." Here, "biopsies" corresponds to "biopsy," "radical prostatectomies" corresponds to "RP," and "shavings" can be interpreted as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, it does not specify a single sample type for a particular lesion. Since the task requires identifying the most severe lesion and the statement discusses multiple types of samples collectively, we'll have to infer or directly state "NA" if not explicitly mentioned for a malignant case.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement starts with mentioning samples from patients "post-benign diagnosis," indicating that the initial diagnosis was benign. It then discusses the re-evaluation and upgrading of some cases to Gleason scores corresponding to malignant findings (e.g., Gleason 3+3 or 3+4). This implies there were malignant tumor findings in some cases after re-evaluation. However, it doesn't directly state the malignancy status of a specific "most severe lesion." The presence of Gleason scores indicates malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions upgrading to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" and "Gleason 6." Gleason 6 can be interpreted as 3+3=6. The most severe lesion mentioned is "3+4," which implies a sum of 7.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion:

- The sample type is not directly linked to the most severe lesion, so we'll consider "NA" due to the lack of specificity.
- Malignancy is "yes" because the statement discusses upgrading to malignant Gleason scores.
- The most severe Gleason grade mentioned is "3+4=7."

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement.
