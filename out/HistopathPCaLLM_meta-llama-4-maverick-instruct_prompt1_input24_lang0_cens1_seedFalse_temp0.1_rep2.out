To address the task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." The task requires identifying the sample type for the most severe lesion. 
   - "Biopsies" correspond to "biopsy."
   - "Radical prostatectomies" correspond to "RP."
   - "Shavings" can be considered as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve removal of prostate tissue, though the context is slightly different.

   The statement does not specify a single sample type for a particular lesion but mentions multiple types used in the study. However, it does not directly relate to a specific "most severe lesion." For the purpose of this task, we will consider the types mentioned and the context.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the original material was "post-benign diagnosis," suggesting that initially, the samples were benign. However, it mentions that in around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4. This implies that there were malignant findings in some cases after re-evaluation.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions upgrading to "Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4" and "Gleason 6," which corresponds to 3+3=6. The most severe lesion mentioned in terms of Gleason grade is "3+4."

Given the information and focusing on the "most severe lesion," we can infer:
- The sample types mentioned are "biopsy," "RP," and "TURP" (implied by "shavings"). Since we are dealing with multiple sample types and not a single lesion, we'll have to choose "NA" if we cannot directly associate a sample type with the most severe lesion described.
- Malignancy is "yes" because some cases were upgraded to malignant categories (Gleason 3+3 or 3+4).
- The most severe Gleason grade mentioned is "3+4=7."

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics as described in the statement. Note that "Sampletype" is "NA" because the statement does not directly associate the most severe lesion with a specific sample type.
