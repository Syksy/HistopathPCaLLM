To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "tissue cylinders," which is indicative of a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "tumor growth" and "tumor tissue" in samples (1) and (2) and concludes with the presence of "prostate adenocarcinoma." Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Both samples (1) and (2) contain tumor with Gleason patterns. Sample (1) has Gleason patterns 4 and 3, and sample (2) also has Gleason patterns 4 and 3. To determine the most severe lesion, we need to look at the Gleason scores. 
   - For sample (1), the Gleason score can be inferred as 4+3 because it mentions "Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%." The sum is 7.
   - For sample (2), it similarly has a Gleason score of 4+3, with the sum being 7.
   Since both samples have the same Gleason sum, we can consider either as the most severe. The statement for both is consistent with a Gleason grade of "4+3=7."

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion's characteristics.
