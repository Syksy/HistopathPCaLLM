To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it's related to prostate cancer histopathological statements and the samples are being discussed in terms of tissue material and Gleason differentiation patterns, we can infer it's likely a biopsy. Since the exact type isn't specified and it doesn't clearly fit into "RP" or "TURP," and given that it's not explicitly stated, the most appropriate answer based on the information given and the context would be "biopsy" if we had to choose from the allowed values. However, the statement doesn't directly confirm the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified due to the limitations in assessing the samples. This implies that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy was not made. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" because it's neither confirmed nor denied.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the Gleason differentiation patterns could be assessed in Sample (1) "in the only measurable plane," but it also states that the case will be discussed at the next uro-meeting due to differing views. It does not provide a specific Gleason score. For Sample (2), differentiation could not be assessed. Thus, the Gleason grade is not reported conclusively for any sample, making "NA" the appropriate answer.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind choosing "NA" for "Sampletype" is that the statement doesn't directly specify the sample type among the given choices, and it involves multiple samples. For "Malignancy" and "Gleason," "NA" is chosen because the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy or provide a Gleason score due to the limitations and uncertainties in the assessment.
