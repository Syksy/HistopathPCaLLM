To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate". Prostatectomy preparate is commonly referred to as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) in medical terminology. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates "Histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor", which confirms the presence of a malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "where the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent". This implies the Gleason grades are 3 and 4. Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, the convention is to sum these values, so 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion as required, in a non-nested JSON format.
