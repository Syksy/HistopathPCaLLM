To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "samples marked with indices A-C for material attributed to apex and indices D-F for sources closer to basis." This kind of detailed sampling is typical in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens where the prostate is sampled at different locations. There's no explicit mention of it being a biopsy or TURP. Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "RP". However, it's not explicitly stated, so one might argue it could be considered as "NA" due to the lack of direct information. For the purpose of this task, we'll consider it as "RP" due to the detailed sampling described.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that the histological inspection is difficult due to recent radiation therapy and refers to clinical notes about a possible 'Gleason sum 7'. The presence of cancer is implied by the mention of "recent radiation therapy" and a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'", but it's not a direct confirmation of malignancy. However, given the context, it seems reasonable to infer that there were malignant findings or at least a strong suspicion of malignancy. The statement doesn't directly state "adenocarcinoma" or another type of cancer, but the reference to Gleason sum implies prostate cancer. Thus, we'll consider "Malignancy" as "yes" due to the context provided.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" and questions whether it is "GG 2 or 3" (presumably referring to Gleason grade groups, but more likely intending to refer to the components of the Gleason score). It is unclear if the sum was verified. The Gleason score is not directly reported from the histopathological examination due to the effects of radiation therapy. Therefore, we cannot confirm the Gleason score with certainty. However, the clinical notes mention a "Gleason sum 7", which could imply a score like "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Since we are to provide the most severe lesion's details and given the information available, we'll have to consider "Gleason" as "NA" because the Gleason score wasn't directly confirmed by the histopathological examination.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested JSON structure with the required fields. The "Sampletype" is considered as "RP" based on the detailed sampling described, "Malignancy" is "yes" due to the context implying cancer, and "Gleason" is "NA" because the Gleason score wasn't directly confirmed by the histopathological examination.
