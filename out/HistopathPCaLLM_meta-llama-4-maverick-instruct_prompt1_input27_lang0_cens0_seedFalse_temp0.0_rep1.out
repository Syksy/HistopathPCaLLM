To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." This context suggests a surgical procedure where tissue is removed and examined. The term "shavings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which involves removing prostate tissue in the form of shavings or chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G". The presence of carcinoma signifies malignancy, so the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason score as "3+3=6", directly indicating the Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "3+3=6".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
