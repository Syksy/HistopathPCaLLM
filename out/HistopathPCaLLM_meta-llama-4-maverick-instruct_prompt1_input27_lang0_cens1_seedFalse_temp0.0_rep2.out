To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it implies a significant amount of tissue was processed, which is more characteristic of a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a TURP rather than a biopsy. However, the exact sample type isn't clearly stated. Given the context and the options available, we can infer it's likely not a standard biopsy due to the quantity of tissue. The statement doesn't directly support "RP" or "TURP" conclusively, so we might lean towards "NA" for not having a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "the growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation," which suggests that there was some expectation or suspicion of tumor differentiation. However, it also mentions that "Histological inspection verified prostatic tissue material present in samples indexed F and G," without directly stating the presence of malignancy. The phrase "did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation" is somewhat ambiguous but leans towards indicating that there wasn't a clear malignant pattern, as it questions the tumor differentiation. The presence of "debatably Gleason score 3" suggests some malignant features, as Gleason score is used for malignant tumors. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignancy due to the mention of Gleason score, indicating some level of malignancy was considered.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." This implies that there is some level of uncertainty about the Gleason score. However, it does not provide a clear "major+minor=sum" format. For the purpose of structuring, since it's debatable and not clearly stated, and there's no clear major and minor grade provided, we might consider this as not having a definitive Gleason score in the required format. Thus, we could consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a clear and definitive Gleason score.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because:
- The sample type is not clearly identified.
- There are indications of malignancy (due to the mention of Gleason score).
- The Gleason score is not definitively provided in the required "major+minor=sum" format.
