To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders," indicating that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in multiple foci, so the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason scores for multiple foci. Focus #1 has a Gleason score of 4+4=8, Focus #2 has a score of 4+3=7, and Focus #3 has a score of 3+4=7. The statement explicitly mentions that the "highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8." Therefore, the most severe lesion has a Gleason grade of 4+4=8.

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
