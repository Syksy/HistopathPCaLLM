To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "six different sites of interest" inspected due to elevated PSA status, and it refers to "prostate tissue." The context implies a biopsy since multiple regions of interest are mentioned, which is common in biopsy reports. Therefore, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical growth patterns," "odd growth patterns," and "possible pre-malignant changes" across different regions of interest. However, it does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The language used suggests suspicion or potential for malignancy but does not confirm malignancy. Thus, the malignancy status is not explicitly "yes." Since there's no clear statement of malignancy or benignancy, and given the context that it's not definitively stated as malignant, we should be cautious. However, the presence of "possible pre-malignant changes" in 80% of one region suggests a significant concern but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we might consider it as not having a definitive "yes" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. Gleason grading is typically associated with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or other specific types of cancer. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not mention Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy" because the context suggests a biopsy with multiple regions of interest examined.
- **Malignancy**: "NA" because while there are suspicious findings, the statement does not definitively diagnose malignancy.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy and thus no Gleason grading provided.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
