To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen..." and describes a detailed process of sampling from different parts of the prostate. The description indicates that the prostate gland was surgically removed and sampled for examination. This process is characteristic of a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen because it involves examining the prostate gland after it has been removed. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the samples taken from the prostate, specifically from the left lobe. This confirms that there were malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused glandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." This indicates that the Gleason score is based on two grades, both of which are 4. The summary mentions "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections," which seems to be a discrepancy because if both observed grades are 4, the sum should be 8. However, interpreting this as the most severe lesion having a Gleason score where one component is likely misreported or misinterpreted as both being grade 4 when it should be 4 and 3 (since 4+3=7), it suggests the Gleason score is intended to be 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion described in the statement.
