To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen..." and describes a detailed process of sampling from different parts of the prostate. The description indicates that the prostate gland was surgically removed and sampled for examination. This process is characteristic of a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as it involves examining the prostate gland after its removal.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the samples taken from the prostate, specifically from the left lobe. This confirms that there were malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused glandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." It then concludes with "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." The description indicates a Gleason score but is somewhat ambiguous in the detailed breakdown. However, it mentions "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4," which could be interpreted as Gleason 4+4=8. Yet, the summary directly states "Score sum 7." Given the information and the summary, it seems there might be a slight inconsistency in interpreting the Gleason score directly from the text. However, the summary directly states the sum is 7, and given the context, it is reasonable to infer the Gleason score is likely intended to be represented as such. A common interpretation for a sum of 7 could be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The text supports a more aggressive tumor with "mostly grade 4," suggesting 4+3=7 as a plausible interpretation.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and using the allowed values, is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the histopathological statement. The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), indicating the prostate was surgically removed and examined. The presence of malignant findings is confirmed with "yes." The Gleason grade is represented as "4+3=7," indicating a sum of 7 with a primary grade of 4 and a secondary grade of 3, consistent with the description of the tumor being "mostly grade 4" and the summary stating a score sum of 7.
