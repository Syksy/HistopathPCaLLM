To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and lists samples taken from different parts of the prostate (left lower, right lower, left middle, right middle, left higher, right higher). It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that samples were taken from specific locations within the prostate, it suggests a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "From sample indices A and C non-prostatic tissue is observed" and that there was a request for the "assessment of potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure observations arising from the said samples." The mention of assessing "poor differentiation" and "fusing grandular structure" could imply a suspicion or context of malignancy, but it does not directly state that malignant tumor findings were present. However, the fact that they are discussing differentiation and glandular structures in the context of potentially needing re-examination suggests that there is a concern for malignancy, but it's not a clear "yes". The statement concludes with "Score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined," which implies an issue with the sample or the assessment rather than a clear statement of malignancy status. Therefore, the malignancy status is not directly stated as "yes" or "no" based on the information given, making it somewhat ambiguous. However, given the context, it seems more aligned with "yes" because they are discussing aspects relevant to cancer assessment.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," which directly relates to the Gleason score. This implies that while there might be an attempt to assess malignancy or its characteristics, the Gleason score could not be determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not provided or determinable from the information given.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't directly compare multiple lesions, it discusses issues with samples A and C and the need for re-examination), would be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structuring assumes that the context implies a potential malignancy being assessed, hence "Malignancy" is "yes", despite the lack of a direct statement confirming malignancy. The Gleason score is "NA" due to the explicit statement that the score sum determination was not possible.
