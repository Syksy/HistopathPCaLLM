To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and lists samples taken from different parts of the prostate (left lower, right lower, left middle, right middle, left higher, right higher). It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests that the material was obtained through a procedure that allows for sampling from different parts of the prostate, which is typical for a biopsy. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "non-prostatic tissue is observed" in samples A and C, suggesting contamination, and discusses the assessment of tumor characteristics (capsule penetration, perineural invasion, differentiation stages of tumor cells) but does not explicitly state that malignancy was found. However, it refers to "tumor cells" and the assessment of "differentiation stages of tumor cells," indicating that malignancy is likely present. The statement also mentions that "Score sum determination was not possible," which implies that there was an attempt to assess the Gleason score, further suggesting that malignancy was suspected or identified. Therefore, we can infer "yes" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," indicating that the Gleason score could not be determined. This implies that while there might be malignant findings, the Gleason grade (in the form of "major+minor=sum") could not be assessed or reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not possible to determine it.

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
