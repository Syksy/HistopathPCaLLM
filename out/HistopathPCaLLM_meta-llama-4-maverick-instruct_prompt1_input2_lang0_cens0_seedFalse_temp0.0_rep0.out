To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen..." Although it initially suggests a prostatectomy (RP), it later clarifies that "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values for "Sampletype", and given that the closest related specimen type is not explicitly listed, we will have to choose the most appropriate value from the given options or use "NA" if none are suitable. Prostatectomy is referred to as "RP" in the allowed values, but the sample is actually from an autopsy. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be "NA" since "autopsy" is not an allowed value.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there are "no tumor growth" findings in the seminal vehicles and describes the growth as "normal benign growth" with some atrophy, inflammation, and hyperplasia. It concludes that the prostate tissue contains "at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." This implies there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the "Gleason" field should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
