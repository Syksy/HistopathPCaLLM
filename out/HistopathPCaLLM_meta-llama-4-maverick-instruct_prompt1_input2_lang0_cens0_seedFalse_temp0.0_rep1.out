To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement describes the sample as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later mentions it was "originally an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. However, it's also stated that the original sample is from an autopsy. For the purpose of this task and based on the given allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"), the closest relevant sample type related to the information given would be "RP" because it directly relates to a prostatectomy specimen, even though it's mentioned that the original intent was for it to be an autopsy sample. The fact that it's described as a prostatectomy specimen takes precedence for determining the sample type related to prostate cancer assessment.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes that the prostate tissue contains "at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It explicitly states that there is "no tumor growth" in the seminal vesicles and that the resection surfaces are clean with no abnormal growth noted. This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (because it's described as a prostatectomy specimen, which aligns with "RP" as the closest relevant category).
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since there's no tumor growth detected).
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (because the sample is benign).

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
