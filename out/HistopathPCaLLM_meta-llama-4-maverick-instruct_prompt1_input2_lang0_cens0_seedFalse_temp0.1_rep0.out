To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is a surgical procedure to remove the prostate gland. However, it's also mentioned as an "autopsy sample." For the purpose of this task and based on the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"), the most appropriate classification seems to be "RP" because it directly relates to a prostatectomy specimen, despite the later mention of it being an autopsy sample. Autopsy samples are not listed among the allowed values, so we'll have to choose the closest relevant sample type related to prostate tissue examination.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and concludes with "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignant findings; instead, it emphasizes benign growth and the absence of tumor growth in the seminal vesicles and at the resection surfaces. Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
