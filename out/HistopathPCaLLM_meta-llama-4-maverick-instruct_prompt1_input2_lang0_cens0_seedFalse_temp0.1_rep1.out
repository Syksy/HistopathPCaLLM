To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a prostate removal surgery, which is often denoted as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, it is described as an "autopsy sample," which is not a standard clinical sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values and it seems to be a specimen obtained after death, it might not directly fit into the categories provided. The closest clinical interpretation related to the provided options would be "RP" due to the mention of it being a "prostatectomy specimen," even though it's noted as being for research and from an autopsy. However, given the context that it's not a standard surgical pathology report but rather an autopsy, the most appropriate answer based on the given choices and the context that it's not a standard "RP" in clinical terms might be considered "NA" due to the confusion and the fact that "autopsy" doesn't directly map to the given choices.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and concludes that "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There's no mention of malignant findings; instead, it emphasizes benign growth. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: Given the confusion between being described as a prostatectomy specimen but also as an autopsy sample, and since "autopsy" is not an allowed value, the closest related clinical sample type might be considered. However, the description leans more towards not being a standard "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." So, "NA" could be considered due to the non-standard context (autopsy).
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the given statement and the allowed values for each field.
