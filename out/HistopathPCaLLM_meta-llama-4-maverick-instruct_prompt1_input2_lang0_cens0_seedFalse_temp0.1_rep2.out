To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a prostate removal surgery, which aligns with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, it's also mentioned as an "autopsy sample," which is not among the listed allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Given that "RP" is the closest relevant surgical specimen type mentioned and it directly relates to the prostate, we will consider "RP" as the sample type despite the later clarification as an autopsy sample, because "autopsy" is not an allowed value.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and concludes that "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." There is no mention of malignant findings; instead, it emphasizes benign growth and the absence of tumor growth in the seminal vesicles and at the resection surfaces. Thus, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
