To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample types allowed are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match any of the specified sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses various findings including "atrophy and inflammation" and mentions that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The presence of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" indicates that there is a suspicion or possibility of malignancy, but it's not definitively stated as malignant. However, the context suggests that malignancy is being considered or looked for, but not confirmed. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy but rather a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma", the most conservative interpretation based on the given text would lean towards "NA" because it's not explicitly confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements or "NA" for benign or non-applicable statements. Since there's no specific Gleason grade provided and the malignancy is not confirmed, the appropriate answer would be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the statement regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade.
