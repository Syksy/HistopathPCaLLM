To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample types allowed are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since "autopsy specimen" is not among the listed options, it should be categorized as "NA" because it doesn't directly correspond to any of the specified sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue..." The presence of "potential adenocarcinoma" suggests that there are indications or suspicions of malignancy, but it's not a definitive diagnosis. However, the question asks for "Malignant tumor findings," and the allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy but rather a potential or suspicion, and given the context that it's not a clear "yes", we should consider it as not having a definitive malignant tumor finding. Therefore, it should be classified as "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned or implied in the statement. The statement does not provide a Gleason score or any related information. Therefore, it should be categorized as "NA" since there's no information about the Gleason grade.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the statement according to the specified requirements.
