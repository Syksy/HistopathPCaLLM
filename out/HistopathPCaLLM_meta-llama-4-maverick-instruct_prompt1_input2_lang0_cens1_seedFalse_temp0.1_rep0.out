To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample types allowed are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since "autopsy specimen" does not match any of the given categories directly and is not explicitly listed among the allowed values, we should categorize it as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue..." This implies that there is a potential for malignancy but it's not definitively stated as present. However, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed; hence, we cannot conclusively say "yes". The most appropriate answer would be "NA" because the statement doesn't directly confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not provided in the statement. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma but does not give a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing the required fields with appropriate values based on the given statement. Since the statement does not directly relate to a specific malignant lesion or provide a clear diagnosis, it is treated as "NA" for the required fields, focusing on the most severe lesion as per the instructions (though no specific lesion is identified).
