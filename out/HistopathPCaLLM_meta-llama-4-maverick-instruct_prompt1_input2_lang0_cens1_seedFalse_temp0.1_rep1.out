To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample types allowed are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since "autopsy specimen" does not match any of the given categories directly and is not explicitly listed among the allowed values, we should categorize it as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue..." The presence of "potential adenocarcinoma" suggests that there is a possibility of malignancy, but it's not definitively stated as being present. However, the context implies that there are findings that could be related to malignancy, but they are not conclusive. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since the statement does not definitively confirm malignancy but hints at the possibility, the most appropriate categorization based on the given instructions would lean towards "NA" due to the ambiguity and lack of a clear "yes" or "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma but does not confirm it or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be categorized as "NA" since there's no definitive malignancy diagnosis or Gleason score provided.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation of the given statement according to the instructions and allowed values.
