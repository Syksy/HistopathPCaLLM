To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample types allowed are "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since the sample is from an autopsy, it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't match any of the specified sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses various findings including "atrophy and inflammation" and mentions that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The presence of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" indicates that there is a suspicion or possibility of malignancy, but it's not definitively stated as malignant. However, given the context that it's discussing "potential adenocarcinoma," it implies that there are some findings that could be related to malignancy, but it's not conclusive. The allowed values are "yes", "no", or "NA". Since there's a mention of "potential adenocarcinoma," it suggests that malignancy is not ruled out, but it's not confirmed either. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The allowed format is "major+minor=sum" or "NA" for benign or non-applicable statements. Since there's no specific mention of Gleason grades, the appropriate answer is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information provided in the statement according to the specified rules and allowed values.
