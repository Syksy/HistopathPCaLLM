To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is from a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) because it involves chippings and is near urothelial cells, which line the urethra and are more likely to be encountered in a TURP procedure.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement confirms the presence of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," indicating that there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer is "yes."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that the "most common pattern" is grade 4, the "secondary pattern" is grade 3, and there's a "tertiary pattern" grade 5. For Gleason scoring, the major and minor patterns are typically considered. Here, the major pattern is 4, and the minor is 3. The sum is 7. Although a tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned, the standard Gleason score is based on the two most prevalent patterns. Therefore, the Gleason score is reported as "4+3=7."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement.
