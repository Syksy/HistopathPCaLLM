To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because it involves chippings and is near urothelial cells, which is typical for TURP samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the "most common pattern" is grade 4, the "secondary pattern" is grade 3, and there's a "tertiary pattern" grade 5. For structuring the Gleason score, we typically consider the two most prevalent patterns (major and minor). Even though a tertiary pattern is mentioned (grade 5), the major and minor patterns are grade 4 and grade 3, respectively. Thus, the Gleason score is reported as "4+3=7."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement.
