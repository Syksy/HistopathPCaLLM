To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION," which doesn't clearly indicate the sample type. Therefore, we should categorize it as "NA" since the specific sample type isn't mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses "atypical findings" and "uncertainties regarding the findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the suspicions could not be confirmed or denied, and further examination is required. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The correct categorization would be "NA" because the statement doesn't definitively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and no Gleason grades are provided, the Gleason grade should be categorized as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing a non-nested structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
