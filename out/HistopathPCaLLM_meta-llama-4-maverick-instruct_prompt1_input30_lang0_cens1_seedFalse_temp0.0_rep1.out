To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION," which doesn't clearly indicate the sample type. Therefore, we should categorize it as "NA" since the specific sample type isn't mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses "atypical findings" and "uncertainties regarding the findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. In fact, it indicates that the suspicions of atypical findings could not be confirmed or denied, suggesting that there isn't a clear diagnosis of malignancy. Hence, we should consider this as "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason grades are provided, we should categorize the Gleason grade as "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by not including nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there's no clear indication of any lesion being malignant or the severity). The values are also within the allowed values for each field.
