To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION," which doesn't clearly indicate the sample type. Therefore, the sample type is not explicitly stated, and we should categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses "atypical findings" and "uncertainties regarding the findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the suspicions could not be confirmed or denied, and the diagnosis remains uncertain, requiring further examination. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, and the text does not directly state the absence of malignancy either, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because the presence or absence of malignancy is not determined.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The discussion revolves around uncertain or atypical findings without confirming a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or any other malignant condition that would necessitate a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no malignant diagnosis confirmed.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by not including nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, no lesion was confirmed). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
