To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies." Since the task is to consider the most severe lesion and the second targeted biopsy is mentioned to have hit a large focus with significant details about the Gleason grade, we will consider the sample type as "biopsy." The specific type (systematic vs. targeted) isn't required; hence, "biopsy" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma with Gleason grades mentioned, indicating malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The most severe lesion is described in the context of the second targeted biopsy, where the primary differentiation pattern is 4 and the second most common is 5. This implies a Gleason score of 4+5. The sum of these grades is 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "4+5=9."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This structured data captures the essence of the most severe lesion described in the statement.
