To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies." Since the task is to consider the most severe lesion and the second targeted biopsy is mentioned to have hit a large focus with significant details about the Gleason grade, we will consider the sample type as "biopsy." The specific type (systematic vs. targeted) isn't required; hence, "biopsy" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (implied by mentioning Gleason grades) in the biopsies, especially in the second targeted biopsy. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement initially mentions a Gleason score of 3+3=6 from the first biopsy. However, it later details a more severe finding from the second targeted biopsy, with a primary differentiation pattern of 4 and a secondary pattern that appears to be 5. Thus, the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9."

Putting it all together, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement.
