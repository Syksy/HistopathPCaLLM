To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to taking samples, which is most closely related to "biopsy." There's no clear indication of it being "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." Therefore, "Sampletype": "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "suspicious findings" but does not confirm malignancy. It mentions that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult" and that "additional samples and treatment planning needed." This implies that while there are suspicious findings, malignancy is not definitively confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The statement does not allow for a definitive "no" either. Hence, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the text does not clearly state the presence or absence of malignancy. So, "Malignancy": "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. It mentions "suspicious findings" but does not confirm malignancy or provide Gleason scores. Therefore, "Gleason": "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information available from the statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
