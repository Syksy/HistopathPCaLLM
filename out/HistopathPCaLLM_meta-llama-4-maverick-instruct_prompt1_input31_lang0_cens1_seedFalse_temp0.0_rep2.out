To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It does mention a "first sample" and "other samples" and "additional samples," indicating sampling was done, but the type is not directly stated. Given the context, it is likely referring to a biopsy, but it's not explicit. Since we can't determine the exact type, we'll have to consider it as not clearly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspicious findings" in the samples, which "encompass only 5% of the original samples." It indicates that there was difficulty in interpretation and that additional samples and treatment planning were needed. However, it does not directly confirm malignancy. The presence of "suspicious findings" does not equate to a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy based on the information given.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information regarding the Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is only reported for malignant tumor findings with specific differentiation scores.

Given these observations:

- For "Sampletype", the statement doesn't explicitly mention the type, so it should be considered as "NA".
- For "Malignancy", since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, it should be considered as "NA" because "suspicious findings" do not confirm malignancy.
- For "Gleason", there's no information provided about the Gleason grade, so it should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
