To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports various Gleason patterns observed in the adenocarcinoma, including "4+4" along with other patterns like "3+3", "3+4", and "4+3". The most severe lesion is associated with the highest Gleason score. Among the mentioned Gleason scores (3+3=6, 3+4=7, 4+3=7, 4+4=8), "4+4=8" is the highest and thus represents the most severe lesion. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
