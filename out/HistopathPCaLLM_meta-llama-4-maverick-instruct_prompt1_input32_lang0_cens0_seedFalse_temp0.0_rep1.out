To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports various Gleason patterns observed in the adenocarcinoma, including "4+4" among others. Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and "4+4" is mentioned as being observed particularly and is one of the higher sums mentioned, it is reasonable to consider "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the instructions, focusing on the most severe lesion reported.
