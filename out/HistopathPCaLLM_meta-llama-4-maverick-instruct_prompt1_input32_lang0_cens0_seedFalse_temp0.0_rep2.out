To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports multiple Gleason patterns observed in the adenocarcinoma, including "4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3." The most severe lesion is typically considered the one with the highest Gleason sum. Among the given Gleason scores:
   - 3+3 = 6
   - 3+4 = 7
   - 4+3 = 7
   - 4+4 = 8
   
   The highest Gleason sum is 8 (4+4). Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
