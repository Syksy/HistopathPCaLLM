To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It talks about samples from different locations and mentions examination results from macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue, but it doesn't specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is "NA" because it's not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, which implies they were not malignant, but it doesn't directly state the malignancy status of the prostate tissue itself. However, the absence of a direct statement about malignancy in the prostate tissue and the focus on other aspects (like lymph nodes and seminal vesicles being clear) suggests that the statement is not directly indicating malignancy. Still, without a clear statement about the prostate tissue being malignant or not, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not mentioned.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
