To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It talks about samples from different locations and mentions examination results from macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue, but it doesn't specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it should be considered as "NA".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, but it doesn't provide a clear statement about the malignancy in the prostate tissue itself. Since there's no direct mention of malignancy or benignancy, and given the context that it doesn't explicitly state the presence of cancer, the most appropriate answer based on the information given would be "NA".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement doesn't mention Gleason grades at all. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" because there's no information provided about the Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement according to the specified requirements.
