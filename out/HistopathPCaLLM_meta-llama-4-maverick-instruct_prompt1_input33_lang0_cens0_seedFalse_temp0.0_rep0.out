To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate", which indicates that the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement talks about "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and mentions a finding in lymph nodes (N1), indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3", indicating the Gleason grades. For the most severe lesion, we consider the higher grade, which in this context is represented by "4+3". The sum of these grades is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion as required.
