To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since there's no explicit information about the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy in the prostate or the sample taken. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not conclusive for malignancy. Hence, we cannot definitively say "yes" for malignancy. The most appropriate answer seems to be "NA" or potentially "no" if we consider the lack of a definitive statement about malignancy in the sample. However, given the ambiguity and the fact that it mentions "possibly abnormal findings," the most cautious interpretation leaning towards the given options would be "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy in the sample.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though no specific lesion details were provided). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
