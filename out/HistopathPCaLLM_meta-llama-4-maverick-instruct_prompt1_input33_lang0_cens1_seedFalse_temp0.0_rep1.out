To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to "Collected samples" and "processed samples" but does not specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is "NA" because it cannot be determined from the information given.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not conclusive for malignancy, and there's no direct statement about malignancy in the prostate or the main sample. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" for malignancy. Since there's a mention of "possibly abnormal findings," it's not a clear "no" either. However, given the lack of a definitive statement on malignancy and the specific instruction to use "yes", "no", or "NA", and considering the statement does not directly confirm or deny malignancy in the context required, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the context of the prostate cancer histopathological findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. It discusses "Pathological findings" and "abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not provide any information on the Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not mentioned or relevant based on the information given.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements and reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the statement.
