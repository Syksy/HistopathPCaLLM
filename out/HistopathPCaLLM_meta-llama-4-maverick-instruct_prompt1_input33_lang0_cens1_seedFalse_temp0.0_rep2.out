To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since there's no explicit information about the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." The presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not conclusive for malignancy. However, the overall context does not definitively confirm malignancy either. Since there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings and the statement leans towards uncertainty or absence in seminal vehicles, we should consider it as "NA" or "no" based on the available information. Given the ambiguity but the explicit absence in seminal vehicles, we might lean towards "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy in the sample overall.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" since Gleason grading is related to the malignancy of prostate cancer, and there's no clear indication of malignancy or its grading.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning for "Malignancy" being "no" is based on the explicit statement of "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and the lack of a definitive statement confirming malignancy elsewhere in the sample. The statement's ambiguity regarding lymph nodes ("Possibly abnormal findings") is not sufficient to conclusively determine malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer, given the available choices and the context, is to reflect the absence of confirmed malignancy.
