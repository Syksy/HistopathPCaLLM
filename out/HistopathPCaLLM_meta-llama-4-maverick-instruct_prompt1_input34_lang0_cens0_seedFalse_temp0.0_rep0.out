To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr." The term "resection" in the context of prostate pathology often refers to a surgical removal of prostate tissue. The most likely sample type here is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, given that the sample is described as being prepared into "six tissue casettes" and weighing a total of 7gr (close to the original weight), and considering typical practices, "TURP" is a plausible interpretation because it involves removing prostate tissue in chips, which are then examined. "RP" typically refers to a more substantial removal of the prostate gland. The description doesn't directly indicate "RP" or "biopsy." Therefore, based on the context, "TURP" seems a reasonable choice for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
