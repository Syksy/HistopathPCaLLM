To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr." The term "resection" in the context of prostate tissue is most likely referring to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or RP (Radical Prostatectomy). However, given that it mentions "resection" and not "radical prostatectomy" explicitly, and considering the context of weighing and preparation into tissue cassettes, it's more likely referring to a TURP. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) is typically referred to as such or simply "prostatectomy." Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and "but no malignities." This confirms that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
