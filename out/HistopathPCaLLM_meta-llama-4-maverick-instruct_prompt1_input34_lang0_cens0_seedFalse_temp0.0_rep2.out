To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr." The term "resection" in the context of prostate pathology often refers to a surgical removal of the prostate or a part of it. The most likely sample type here is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), as it involves a significant amount of tissue (7.5gr) and is prepared into multiple tissue cassettes. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another possibility for a resection, but "RP" is more likely given the context of a single specimen and the weight. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma." and "but no malignities." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. So, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) and adhering to the specified allowed values.
