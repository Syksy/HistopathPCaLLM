To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "six tissue casettes" and discusses histological findings, which is common in biopsy or surgical specimens. The weight and preparation into tissue cassettes could be seen in various sample types, but "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) often involves weighing the specimen. The statement doesn't explicitly indicate it's a biopsy or TURP, but given the context (weight and histological examination), it could be inferred as likely being related to a surgical specimen. However, without explicit mention, the most cautious interpretation based on the given options and the context (weight of 7.5gr and preparation into tissue cassettes) might lean towards "RP". Yet, the exact sample type isn't directly stated, so one might argue it could be "NA" due to lack of explicit information. For the sake of this task, let's consider it as "RP" due to the weight being mentioned, which is a common practice in pathology reports for prostatectomy specimens.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (presumably meaning prostatic adenocarcinoma or cancer) and instead notes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings reported; instead, it highlights benign findings (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). Thus, the answer to this is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign ("Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen") and do not indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tumors. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics (or lack thereof, in this case, as it's benign) in the given statement.
