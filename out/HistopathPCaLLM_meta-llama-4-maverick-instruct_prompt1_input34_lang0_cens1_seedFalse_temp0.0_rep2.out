To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "six tissue casettes" and discusses histological findings, which is common in biopsy or surgical specimens. The weight and preparation into tissue cassettes could be seen in various sample types, but "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) often involves weighing the specimen. The statement doesn't explicitly indicate it's a biopsy or TURP, but given the context (weight and histological examination), it could be inferred as likely being related to a surgical specimen. However, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support identifying it as "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" based on the given information alone. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information given and the allowed values would be "NA" since the sample type isn't explicitly stated.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (presumably meaning prostatic adenocarcinoma or cancer) and instead notes "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings reported; instead, it highlights benign findings (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation) and do not indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for malignant prostate tissues. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the given statement.
