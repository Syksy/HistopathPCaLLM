To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative prostate biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of carcinoma." This means there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no signs of carcinoma (malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
