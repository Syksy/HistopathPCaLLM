To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative prostate biopsies," indicating the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of carcinoma." This means there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no signs of carcinoma (malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no carcinoma) in the given histopathological statement.
