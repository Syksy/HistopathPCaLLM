To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "left and right lobe" and mentions specific pathological findings, which could be seen in various sample types. Without explicit mention, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given information. Thus, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a pre-malignant condition, not malignant. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not report any malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
