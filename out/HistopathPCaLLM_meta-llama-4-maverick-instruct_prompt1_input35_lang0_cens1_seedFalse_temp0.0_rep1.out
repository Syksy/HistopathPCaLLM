To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "left and right lobe" and mentions specific pathological findings, which could be seen in various sample types. Without explicit mention, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given information. Thus, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous lesion but is not classified as malignant. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement discusses PIN changes and hyperplasia but does not report any malignant findings or Gleason scores. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there are no malignant findings.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information provided in the statement according to the required fields.
