To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we have to infer or directly state it as "NA" if not mentioned. Upon careful reading, it doesn't specify the sample type. Hence, the sample type is "NA".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" but does not directly indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. High-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous condition, not cancer itself. Therefore, based on the information given, there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades. Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer. Since there's no mention of cancer or Gleason grades, and the findings are more aligned with benign or pre-cancerous conditions, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
