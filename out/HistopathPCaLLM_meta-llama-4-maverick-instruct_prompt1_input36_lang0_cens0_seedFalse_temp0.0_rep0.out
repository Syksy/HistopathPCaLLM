To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." This context suggests a significant tissue sample, which is more indicative of a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) due to the size and weight mentioned, rather than a biopsy or TURP.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Therefore, the answer to this is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there are "No signs of malignity," the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it should be "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no Gleason score is provided).
