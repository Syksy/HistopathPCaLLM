To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and mentions "macro casettes" and "regular cassettes," which suggests a significant tissue sample. The size and weight are more indicative of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen rather than a biopsy. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimens can also be large but the context here (weight and size) is more suggestive of RP. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion (in this case, there being no malignancy) in the required format.
