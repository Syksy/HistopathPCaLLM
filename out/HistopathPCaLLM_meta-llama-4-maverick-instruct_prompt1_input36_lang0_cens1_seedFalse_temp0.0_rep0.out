To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about preparing "8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes," which is a process often associated with pathology labs handling various types of samples. The term "macro casettes" could imply a larger sample size, but it doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Without explicit mention, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given information. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but explicitly states that it "was not assessed reliably." More importantly, it doesn't mention the presence of adenocarcinoma or any malignant findings. The absence of a clear malignancy statement and the mention of hyperplasia (which is typically benign) could suggest a benign condition, but the reliability of the assessment is questioned. However, there's no clear indication of malignancy ("yes"), so we lean towards "no" due to the context implying a benign condition, despite the assessment not being reliable.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the mention of hyperplasia, suggests that the sample did not contain malignant tumor findings that would necessitate Gleason grading. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by providing a flat JSON structure with the required fields and values based on the analysis of the given statement.
