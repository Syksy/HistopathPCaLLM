To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about preparing "8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes," which is a process often associated with pathology labs handling various types of samples. The term "macro casettes" could imply a larger sample size, but it doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Without explicit mention, we have to infer or directly state "NA" if it can't be determined. In this case, the sample type isn't clearly stated, so we'll have to consider it as "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the condition "was not assessed reliably," but there's no direct mention of malignancy. The conditions mentioned (nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia) are typically benign. Therefore, we can infer "Malignancy" as "no" since there's no indication of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the description of benign conditions (hyperplasia), suggests that the Gleason grade is not applicable here. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information provided in the statement according to the required format.
