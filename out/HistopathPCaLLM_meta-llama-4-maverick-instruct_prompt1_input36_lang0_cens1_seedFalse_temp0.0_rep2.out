To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes," which implies a specimen was processed, likely from a surgical procedure. The mention of "cassettes" is common in pathology for processing specimens, and the context doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy. However, without explicit mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given that "biopsy" is a common specimen type that is processed in cassettes, one might lean towards "biopsy." Yet, the description doesn't directly support identifying the sample type with certainty. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information and the allowed values would be "NA" due to the lack of direct evidence.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia," indicating benign conditions. It explicitly states that the specimen "was not assessed reliably" for something (implied to be malignancy or the condition in question), but the context suggests that there was no clear indication of malignancy. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement doesn't indicate the presence of a malignant tumor and instead discusses benign conditions (hyperplasia), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the information given in the statement.
