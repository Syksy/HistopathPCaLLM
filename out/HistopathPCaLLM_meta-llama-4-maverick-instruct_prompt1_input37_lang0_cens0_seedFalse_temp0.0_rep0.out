To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." This indicates that the sample was obtained through a process related to "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as TURP involves the removal of prostate tissue by electrosection or resection. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the histological examination findings as "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation in typical places" with a conclusion of "hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "Findings indicate hyperplasia" and does not mention adenocarcinoma or any malignant tumor, it is a benign statement. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tumors.

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
