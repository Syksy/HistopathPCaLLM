To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." This context suggests a surgical procedure where tissue is removed and examined. "Electrosection chippings" is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue by electrosection or electrocautery.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the histological examination findings as "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation in typical places." It concludes with "Findings indicate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant cells or tumor; instead, it indicates hyperplasia, which is a non-cancerous condition. Thus, the malignancy finding is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and in this case, the diagnosis is hyperplasia, not cancer. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP" because the context implies a TURP procedure.
- **Malignancy**: "no" since the findings indicate hyperplasia, a benign condition.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" as there are no malignant findings.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
