To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate." This context suggests a surgical procedure where tissue is removed and examined. "Electrosection chippings" is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue by electrosection (a technique using electrical current). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the histological examination findings as "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation in typical places" with a conclusion of "hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, it indicates a benign condition (hyperplasia). Thus, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with a diagnosis of "hyperplasia" and does not mention adenocarcinoma or any malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" for this benign condition.

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
