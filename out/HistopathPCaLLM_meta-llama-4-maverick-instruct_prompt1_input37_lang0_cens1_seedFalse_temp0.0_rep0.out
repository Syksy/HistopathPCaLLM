To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "sample material preparated" and "prostate tissue," which could be related to any of these. Without specific information, we can't directly infer the sample type from the given text. Therefore, the sample type should be considered as "NA" since it's not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. It indicates that "further examination was not possible at this time," suggesting that a conclusive diagnosis wasn't made. Therefore, we should consider the malignancy as "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade and the statement doesn't confirm malignancy, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the original statement, adhering to the allowed values for each field.
