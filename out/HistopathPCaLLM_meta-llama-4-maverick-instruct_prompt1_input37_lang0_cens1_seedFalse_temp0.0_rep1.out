To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "sample material preparated" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "prostate tissue," which could be related to various sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP). Without specific information on the sample type, we have to consider the context or default to "NA" if not directly mentioned.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "Minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly mention malignancy. The description does not directly indicate cancer; hence, we should consider it as not having malignant findings or being uncertain. The statement does not directly say "benign" or "malignant," so we need to infer or directly state "NA" if no clear indication is given.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer diagnoses. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason grade is provided, it should be considered as "NA".

Given the statement and the required fields, let's analyze the details:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it should be considered as "NA".
- There's no clear indication of malignancy; hence, "Malignancy" could be considered "no" or "NA". Since the statement doesn't directly indicate cancer but also doesn't rule it out definitively and mentions further examination is needed, the most cautious interpretation would lean towards "NA".
- The Gleason grade is not mentioned, so it is "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given statement, is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the information provided in the statement and adhering to the allowed values for each field.
