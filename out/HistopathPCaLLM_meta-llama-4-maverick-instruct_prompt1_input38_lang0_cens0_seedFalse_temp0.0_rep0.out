To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy, as needle biopsies are a form of biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "No suspected malignity." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "No suspected malignity" and describes the tissue as "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" without mentioning any malignant features or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA" for benign statements.

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
