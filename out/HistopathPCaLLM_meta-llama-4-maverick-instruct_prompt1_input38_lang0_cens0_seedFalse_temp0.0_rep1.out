To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy, specifically needle biopsies.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "No suspected malignity." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Now, let's structure the information according to the given requirements:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" (since it's needle biopsies, it falls under the category of biopsy)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (as there's no suspected malignity)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since the sample is benign)

Here's the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements and format.
