To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Representative samples are collected" and discusses histological examination findings. Without specific mention of the sample type, and given the context that it's a histopathological statement, we can't directly infer the sample type from the information provided. Therefore, we should categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy status is "no" since there's no mention of cancer or malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since the statement is benign (indicating "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" without any malignancy), the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
