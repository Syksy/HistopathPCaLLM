To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Representative samples are collected" and discusses histological examination findings. Without specific mention of the sample type, and given that it's not directly related to the type of surgical specimen or procedure, we might infer it's a biopsy due to the context of "representative samples" often being used in this context. However, the exact type isn't specified, so we should consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "no" since there's no mention of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate the presence of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given histopathological statement.
