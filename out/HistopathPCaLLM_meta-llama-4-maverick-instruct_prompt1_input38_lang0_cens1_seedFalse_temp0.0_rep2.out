To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "Representative samples are collected" and mentions "histological examination," which is common for biopsy samples. Since it's not explicitly stated, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "no" since there's no mention of cancer or adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned, which is consistent with the absence of a malignancy diagnosis. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is not malignant).
