To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation." The term "prostatectomy preparate" is synonymous with "Radical Prostatectomy" (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor" and further discusses characteristics of the tumor such as "positive marginal" and "Gleason grade." The presence of a tumor with a Gleason grade implies malignancy. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as "3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages" and concludes that "Gleason grade is 7." The major grade is 3, and the minor grade is 4, summing up to 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be represented as "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement about prostate cancer, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
