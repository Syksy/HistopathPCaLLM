To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is often abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor" and further discusses characteristics of the tumor such as "positive marginal" and "Gleason grade." The presence of a tumor with discussion on Gleason grade implies malignancy. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7." This directly translates to a Gleason score where the major grade is 3, the minor grade is 4, and the sum is 7. Thus, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
