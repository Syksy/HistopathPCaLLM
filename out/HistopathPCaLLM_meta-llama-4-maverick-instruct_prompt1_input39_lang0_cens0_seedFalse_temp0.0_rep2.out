To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation." Prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor" and mentions "a positive marginal was seen," indicating the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as "3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages" and states "Gleason grade is 7." It implies the Gleason score is calculated as 3+4=7. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be structured as "3+4=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format for the provided statement is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information extracted from the histopathological statement.
