To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" and "Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations." This kind of description is more aligned with a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as it mentions slices and microscopic inspection. However, without a clear indication, we must be cautious. Since "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves examining the whole prostate gland and the statement doesn't directly imply this, and given that the sample size is mentioned as 20 ( likely in mm, but the unit is not specified), it's somewhat ambiguous. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a "TURP" either. Therefore, without explicit information, the most conservative approach would be to consider it as "NA" for Sample type due to lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Hence, the appropriate answer for Malignancy is "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." This means the Gleason grade is not available or "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the required format and reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the statement.
