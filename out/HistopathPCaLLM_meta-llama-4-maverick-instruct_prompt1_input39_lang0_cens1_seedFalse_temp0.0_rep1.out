To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" and "Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations." This kind of description is more aligned with a biopsy or possibly a TURP, but without explicit mention, it's a bit challenging. Since it doesn't clearly state the sample type and doesn't fall into the explicitly mentioned categories based on the given details, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This indicates uncertainty about the presence of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Hence, the appropriate answer is "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." This means the Gleason grade is not available or "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the requirements by not using nested structures and providing the results for the most severe lesion (though in this case, the severity or presence of a lesion is unclear). The values are also within the allowed ranges for each field.
