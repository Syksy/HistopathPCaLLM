To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" and "Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations." This kind of language is often used in the context of biopsy or TURP. Since it doesn't explicitly state the sample type and doesn't directly imply "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and given that "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) often involves examining slices of tissue, we might lean towards "TURP" or "biopsy." However, without a clear indication, the most cautious choice would be "NA" if we strictly follow the given information. But, considering typical scenarios and the fact that it mentions "some slices extracted," we might consider it as potentially "TURP" or "biopsy." For the sake of this task and without more specific details, let's consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This implies uncertainty about the presence of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Hence, the appropriate answer is "NA" as it reflects the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." This directly implies that the Gleason grade or score is "NA" because it was not possible to determine it.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects the uncertainty and lack of clear information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason score in the provided statement.
