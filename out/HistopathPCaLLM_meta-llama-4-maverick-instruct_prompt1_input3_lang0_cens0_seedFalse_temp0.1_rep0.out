To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which is indicative of a specific type of sample. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes that there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
