To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings," which is typically associated with a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy found, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
