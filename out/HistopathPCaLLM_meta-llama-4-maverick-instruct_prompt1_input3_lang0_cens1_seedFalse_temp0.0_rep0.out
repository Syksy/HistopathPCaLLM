To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material," which indicates a significant amount of tissue is present. The context suggests this is not a biopsy, as biopsies typically involve much smaller tissue samples. It mentions the sample is done in "a single run," which could imply a surgical procedure. Given the amount of material and the context, the most likely sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it is known for involving a substantial amount of prostate tissue. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is also a possibility but typically involves more extensive tissue removal and examination. The exact procedure isn't directly stated, but based on the information and the process of elimination, "TURP" seems a plausible choice.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement notes "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignant findings; instead, it highlights an inability to make a conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts. Therefore, the malignancy status is not definitively stated as "yes" or "no" based on the information given. Since no conclusive diagnosis of malignancy is made, and it's not explicitly stated as benign either, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade information. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer, and its absence here, combined with the lack of a definitive malignancy diagnosis, means the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: Given the context and the amount of tissue, "TURP" is a reasonable choice.
- **Malignancy**: "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" as there's no malignancy diagnosis and thus no Gleason grade provided.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
