To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate material, which is done in a single run." It indicates a significant amount of prostate material was examined, suggesting it could be from a procedure that removes a substantial amount of tissue. The key phrase here is "over a dozen grams of prostate material," which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) given the quantity of tissue. Thus, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement notes "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignant findings; instead, it highlights the inability to make a conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts. Therefore, the malignancy status is "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy and is inconclusive due to artefacts, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported. Hence, it should be "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information derived from the given histopathological statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
