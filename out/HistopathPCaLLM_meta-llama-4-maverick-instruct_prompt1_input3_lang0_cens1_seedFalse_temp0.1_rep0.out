To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate material, which is done in a single run." It indicates a significant amount of prostate material was examined, suggesting it could be from a procedure that removes a substantial amount of tissue. The key phrase here is "over a dozen grams of prostate material," which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy, as TURP typically involves removing larger amounts of tissue. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) also involves a significant amount of tissue but the context here (done in a single run) aligns more with TURP. So, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some inflammation is apparent" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. In fact, it concludes with "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run," implying that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy wasn't made. Therefore, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes," so it should be considered as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the examination.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and mentions that "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material," a Gleason grade is not provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because the statement is not conclusive for malignancy.

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "NA"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
