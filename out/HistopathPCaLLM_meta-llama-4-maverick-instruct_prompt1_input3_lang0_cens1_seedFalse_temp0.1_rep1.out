To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material," which indicates a significant amount of tissue is present. The context suggests this is not a biopsy, as biopsies typically involve much smaller tissue samples. It mentions the sample is done in "a single run," which could imply a surgical procedure. Given the amount of material and the context, this is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or an "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, the presence of "burn artefacts" is more commonly associated with TURP due to the cauterization involved in the procedure. Thus, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement notes "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignant findings; instead, it highlights an inability to conclude due to artefacts. Therefore, the malignancy status is "NA" because the statement doesn't conclusively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no conclusive diagnosis of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions by providing a flat structure with the required fields and using the allowed values.
