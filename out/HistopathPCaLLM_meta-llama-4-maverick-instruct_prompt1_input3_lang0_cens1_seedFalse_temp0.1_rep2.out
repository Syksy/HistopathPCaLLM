To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate material, which is done in a single run." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA), but given that it mentions "over a dozen grams of prostate material" and it's done in a "single run," it suggests a significant amount of tissue, which is more indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves more tissue and is not usually described as being done in a "single run." Biopsy samples are generally much smaller. Therefore, based on the context, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some inflammation is apparent" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run" due to "burn artefacts," implying that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy could not be made. Thus, the malignancy status is "NA" because the examination was inconclusive.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and mentions that detailed examination was prevented due to artefacts, it does not provide a Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "NA"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
