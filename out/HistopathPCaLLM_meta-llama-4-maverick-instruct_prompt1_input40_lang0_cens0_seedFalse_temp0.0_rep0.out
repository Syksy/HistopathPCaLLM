To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving material" which is often associated with a specific type of surgical procedure. Given the context, "shaving material" is most likely related to a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves removing shavings of prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia". This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign (Benign prostate hyperplasia) and does not mention any malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
