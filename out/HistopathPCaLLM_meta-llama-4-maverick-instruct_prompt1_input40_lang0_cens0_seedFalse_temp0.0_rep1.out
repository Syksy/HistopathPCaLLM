To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving material" and that it was "set on eight casettes." The context suggests a surgical procedure, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context of prostate examination and the mention of "shaving material," it is likely referring to a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as this involves removing shavings of prostate tissue.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign (Benign prostate hyperplasia) and there's no mention of malignant cells or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP" (as it's the most likely procedure given the context of "shaving material")
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since the statement clearly indicates benign findings)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (because the sample was benign and did not have malignancy)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
