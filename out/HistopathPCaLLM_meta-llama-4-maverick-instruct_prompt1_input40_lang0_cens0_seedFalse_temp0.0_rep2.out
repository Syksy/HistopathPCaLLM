To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving material" and that it was "set on eight casettes." The context suggests a surgical procedure, but it doesn't directly state the type. However, given the context of prostate tissue examination, "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a common procedure that involves removing shavings of prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign (Benign prostate hyperplasia) and there's no mention of malignant cells or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
