To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examined material weights 8.9, approx 8 casettes are used." This indicates that some material was examined, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, it implies a surgical specimen. The terms "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are specific types of samples. "RP" and "TURP" are more likely to be associated with significant weights and multiple cassettes due to the amount of tissue typically involved. "Biopsy" usually involves less tissue. The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given the context (weight and number of cassettes), it could suggest "TURP" or "RP". However, without a clear indication, and considering the ambiguity, the safest choice based on the information given would be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Histological examination reveals at least hyperplastic prostate and ...... At least inflammation, but possibly something else." It indicates the presence of hyperplasia and inflammation but does not confirm malignancy. The phrase "possibly something else" suggests uncertainty or the need for further evaluation, which implies that malignancy is not ruled out but not confirmed either. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because the statement does not definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no clear indication of malignancy ("adenocarcinoma" is not mentioned), and certainly no mention of Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions by not including nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed).
