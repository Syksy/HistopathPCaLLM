To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, which is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. So, the value for malignancy should be "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates there is no prostate cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the value for the Gleason grade should be "NA" as it is a benign statement.

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
