To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to the "biopsy" sample type. Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This means there are no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no prostate cancer detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof).
