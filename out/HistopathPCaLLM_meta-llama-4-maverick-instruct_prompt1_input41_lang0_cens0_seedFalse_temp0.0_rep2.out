To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, which is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This means there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for malignancy should be "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates there is no prostate cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) and adhering to the specified allowed values.
