To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes of the prostate and the description provided, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy" since it's common for biopsies to be taken from different parts of the prostate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes findings of "little chronic inflammation," "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation," and mentions that it's "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This indicates that there are no clear malignant tumor findings reported; the focus is on inflammation and atrophy, and there's uncertainty regarding cancer-related changes. Thus, it leans towards not having a confirmed malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and no mention of specific Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it's used for malignant statements.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's the reasoning:
- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" because samples were collected from the prostate lobes, which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
- **Malignancy**: "no" because there's no clear indication of malignant findings; the statement highlights uncertainty and describes benign or non-specific findings like inflammation and atrophy.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant tumors, and there's no confirmed malignancy here.
