To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes of the prostate and the description fits a diagnostic procedure, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes findings such as "little chronic inflammation," "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation," and mentions that it's "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This indicates that there are no clear malignant tumor findings reported. Thus, the malignancy is "no" because there's no confirmation of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" (because samples are taken from the prostate, likely indicating a biopsy procedure)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since there's no confirmation of cancer)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (because the statement is benign or inconclusive regarding malignancy)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
