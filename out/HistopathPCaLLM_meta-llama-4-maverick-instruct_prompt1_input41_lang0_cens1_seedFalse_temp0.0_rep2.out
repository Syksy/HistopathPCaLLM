To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes of the prostate and the mention of multiple samples, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy" since biopsies often involve taking multiple samples from different parts of the prostate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there are findings of chronic inflammation and atrophied glands but concludes with "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This implies that there is no clear evidence of malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy status can be considered as "no" because it does not confirm the presence of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer ("Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not"), it does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grade is used for malignant tumors, and in this case, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics (or lack thereof) as described in the statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
