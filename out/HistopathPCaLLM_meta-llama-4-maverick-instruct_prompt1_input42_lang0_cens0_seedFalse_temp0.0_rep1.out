To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a specimen obtained after a surgical removal of the prostate gland. The term "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The presence of Gleason grades (4 and 3) indicates that the statement is referring to a malignant tumor since Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as 4 and 3 with a sum of 7. It is mentioned as "score 7 (4+3)". Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
