To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the information provided, we can infer that it's likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear indication that it's RP or TURP, and considering the weight is mentioned ("Prostate sample weighing app 8?"), it might lean more towards a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as both can involve weighing or measuring tissue. However, without explicit information, the most cautious choice would be "NA" due to the lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty regarding the presence of cancer, so it cannot be definitively classified as malignant or benign based on the information given. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" because the presence of malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer and does not provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
