To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the information provided, we can infer that it's likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, we should be cautious. The weight is mentioned ("weighing app 8?"), which could hint at a larger sample, but without clear indication, we might lean towards "NA" if we were strictly interpreting. However, in many contexts, a prostate sample could imply a biopsy. For the sake of this task and without further clarification, we'll consider it as "biopsy" due to the lack of clear indication towards RP or TURP, and the fact that biopsy is a common sample type for such assessments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty regarding the presence of cancer, so we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the presence of malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer and does not provide Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions provided, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed), and presents the information in a non-nested JSON format.
