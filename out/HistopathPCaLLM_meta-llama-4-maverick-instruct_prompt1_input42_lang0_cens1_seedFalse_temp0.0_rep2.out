To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it's likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, we should be cautious. The weight is mentioned ("weighing app 8"), which could hint at a larger sample, but without more specific information, we can't be certain. Given the lack of explicit information, the most appropriate answer seems to be "NA" because we cannot confidently determine the sample type from the information provided.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty regarding the presence of cancer, and it hasn't been confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The correct interpretation here is "NA" because the presence of malignancy is uncertain and not definitively stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer and does not provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade in the original statement.
