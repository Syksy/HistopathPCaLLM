To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and that "about 15g left in the jar." This context suggests that the sample is from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves chippings and a significant amount of tissue.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable, hence it should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP" because the description fits the procedure.
- **Malignancy**: "no" as there's no adenocarcinoma detected.
- **Gleason**: "NA" since the sample is benign.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
