To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and "Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." This context suggests that the sample is from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves prostate chippings, which is typical for TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected ("no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma"), the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
