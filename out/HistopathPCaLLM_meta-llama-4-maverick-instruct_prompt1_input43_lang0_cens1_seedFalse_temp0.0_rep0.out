To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." This context suggests a significant amount of tissue is being examined, which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight (30g) is substantial and more typical of a prostatectomy or a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen. However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated. Given the context, it is less likely to be a simple biopsy due to the quantity of the sample. Between RP (Radical Prostatectomy) and TURP, the description doesn't directly point to either but given that it's not explicitly a biopsy and there's a significant amount of tissue, we can consider it might be either RP or TURP. The description doesn't directly indicate the type of surgery or procedure, but the quantity and the fact that it's weighed suggests a more substantial specimen like RP. However, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. For the sake of this task, let's consider it as "RP" due to the significant sample size and the detailed examination described.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." This indicates that there are no clear malignant findings reported. The pathologist mentions "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there's no definitive evidence of malignancy, leaning towards it being benign or inconclusive rather than malignant. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "no" because there's no confirmation of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy identified or Gleason grade assigned, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" (Not Applicable) for benign statements.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics (or lack thereof) as per the given statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
