To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Approx 30g prostate samples. Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar." This context suggests a significant amount of tissue is being examined, which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight (30g) is substantial and more typical of a prostatectomy or a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) specimen. However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated. Given the context, it is likely to be either "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP". Since it doesn't explicitly mention the nature of the surgery or procedure and given the weight and the fact that material is in cassettes and a jar, it could lean more towards "TURP" or "RP". However, "TURP" is often associated with chips of prostate tissue, and a weight of 30g could be plausible for a prostatectomy specimen. Without more specific procedural information, the most likely sample type based on the weight and processing (cassettes and jar) is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." This indicates that there are no clear malignant findings reported. The pathologist is unable to confirm cancerous changes, suggesting the sample is either benign or inconclusive for malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "no" since it doesn't confirm malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the given statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
