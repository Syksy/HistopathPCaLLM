To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it mentions "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar," it suggests a surgical specimen. The weight of the sample (approx 30g) and the description could be compatible with a prostatectomy (RP) or possibly a TURP, as both involve significant tissue sampling. However, the exact nature (RP vs. TURP) isn't directly stated. Since it's not explicitly a biopsy and given the quantity of tissue, it's more likely to be either RP or TURP. Without more specific information, we might lean towards "RP" due to the mention of a significant amount of tissue, but it's not a strong indication. For the purpose of this task and without clear indication, we might consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there were no clear malignant findings. It describes the tissue as "mostly ordinary prostate tissue" with "isolated atrophied glands visible," but no cancer is identified. Thus, the malignancy status can be considered as "no" since there's no indication of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing the required information in the specified format for the most severe lesion (which, in this case, is not malignant).
