To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the tissue as "normally structured prostate tissue" and mentions "nothing suspicious." It also explicitly states, "now no tumor tissue can be seen," indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings in the current sample. Although it mentions that "earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer," the question pertains to the current sample. Thus, the malignancy status for the current sample is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant findings in the current sample, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) in the sample.
