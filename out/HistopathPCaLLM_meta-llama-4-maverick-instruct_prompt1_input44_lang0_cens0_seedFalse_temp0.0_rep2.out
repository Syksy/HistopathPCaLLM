To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the tissue as "normally structured prostate tissue" and mentions "nothing suspicious." It also explicitly states, "now no tumor tissue can be seen," indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings in the current sample. Although it mentions that "earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer," the question pertains to the current sample. Thus, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant findings in the current biopsy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, hence it should be "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (or lack thereof) as per the instructions.
