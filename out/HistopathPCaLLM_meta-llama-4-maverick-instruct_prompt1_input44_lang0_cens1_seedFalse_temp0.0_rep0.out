To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," it implies the current sample is likely from a biopsy as well. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not conclusively show malignancy, but it does not rule it out either. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the purpose of this task, we focus on the current sample's findings. Since it doesn't conclusively show malignancy, we consider it as not having definitive malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "NA" or potentially "no" based on the current sample's conclusiveness. Given the allowed values and the context that it's not a clear "yes," we'll have to decide based on the presence of a clear statement on malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for the current sample, as it doesn't report any malignant findings. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy" (inferred from the context)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since it doesn't conclusively show malignancy and the statement directly related to the sample doesn't confirm it)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since there's no malignancy reported in the current sample)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given statement.
