To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," it implies the current sample is also likely from a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not conclusively show malignancy, so the malignancy status is not affirmative. However, it also mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the current sample, though, the malignancy finding is not conclusive. Thus, the malignancy finding for this sample should be considered as "no" because it does not confirm malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy ("Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes"), and there's no mention of Gleason grades for this sample, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given histopathological statement.
