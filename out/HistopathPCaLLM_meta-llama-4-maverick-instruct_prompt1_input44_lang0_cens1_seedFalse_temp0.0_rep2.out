To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," it is reasonable to infer that the current sample is also from a "biopsy." Therefore, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This implies that the current sample does not conclusively show malignancy, although it mentions that earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer. For the current sample, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no" because it does not confirm malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy in the current sample and does not provide Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" (Not Available or Not Applicable) for benign or inconclusive statements.

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no" (because the statement does not confirm malignant changes in the current sample)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since there's no malignancy confirmed in the current sample)

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing a flat structure with the required fields and values based on the most severe lesion (or the only lesion discussed) in the given statement.
