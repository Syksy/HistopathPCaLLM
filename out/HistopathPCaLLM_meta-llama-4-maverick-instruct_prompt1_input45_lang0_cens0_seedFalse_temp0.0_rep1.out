To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." The term "prostatectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "Perineural invasion seen, tissue gleason 3." The presence of a tumor and the mention of Gleason grade indicate that the findings are malignant. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "classes 3+4" and "tissue gleason 3." The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it seems there might be a slight confusion in the interpretation because it first mentions "classes 3+4" and then specifically mentions "tissue gleason 3." However, given the context, "classes 3+4" likely refers to the Gleason score, implying a score of 3+4=7. The subsequent mention of "tissue gleason 3" might be referring to a specific aspect or a dominant pattern but is not clearly the overall Gleason score. For the purpose of structuring, we'll consider "3+4=7" as the Gleason score because it represents the overall grading.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
