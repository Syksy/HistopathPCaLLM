To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate sample" but does not directly state the type. However, it refers to "sections O and P" and mentions "lymph nodes in the area," indicating it could be a surgical specimen. The mention of specific sections and the description might lean more towards a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) sample, as it involves detailed examination of the prostate and surrounding tissues like seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically involves chips of prostate tissue and doesn't usually include seminal vesicles or lymph nodes in the specimen. "Biopsy" is less likely due to the detailed description of multiple sections and the involvement of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. It describes a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be suggestive of cancer, but it also states "the structure is unclear and not able to detect." It concludes with "Further inspection is needed," indicating uncertainty or inconclusiveness regarding malignancy. Since there's no clear statement of malignancy, we'll have to consider this as "NA" due to the lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Since Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate cancer and the statement does not confirm malignancy, it's not surprising that Gleason grades are not provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information provided in the statement.
