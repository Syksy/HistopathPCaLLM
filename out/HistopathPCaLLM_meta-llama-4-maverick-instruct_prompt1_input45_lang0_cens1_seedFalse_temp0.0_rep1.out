To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate sample" but does not directly state the type. However, it refers to "sections O and P" and mentions "lymph nodes in the area," indicating it could be related to a surgical specimen. The terms "Sample material from the middle (E, F, G)" and the description of examining various sections and marginals suggest a significant surgical specimen. The mention of "capsel intact" and examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes points towards a more extensive surgical sample like a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) rather than a biopsy or TURP. Thus, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. It describes a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be suggestive of a pathological process. However, it explicitly states "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "Further inspection is needed," indicating that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy was not made. Therefore, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes." Given the uncertainty and the need for further inspection, the closest answer would be "NA" as it doesn't directly state "yes" or "no" to malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade and the malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the information given in the statement.
