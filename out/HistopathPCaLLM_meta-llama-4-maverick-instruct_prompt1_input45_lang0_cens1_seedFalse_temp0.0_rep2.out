To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions a "prostate sample" but does not directly state the type. However, it refers to "sections O and P" and mentions "lymph nodes in the area," suggesting it could be related to a surgical specimen. The terms "Sample material from the middle (E, F, G)" and the description of examining various sections and marginals imply a significant surgical specimen. The mention of "capsel intact" and examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as these are common assessments in RP pathology reports.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. It describes a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be suggestive of cancer, but it also states "the structure is unclear and not able to detect." The overall tone is inconclusive regarding malignancy, and it suggests "Further inspection is needed." Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not definitively stated.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the uncertainty about malignancy, suggests that either the sample was not conclusively malignant or the Gleason grade was not assessed.

Given these observations:

- **Sample type**: The description is most consistent with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), as it involves examination of seminal vesicles and lymph nodes, and the specimen is described in a manner consistent with a surgical resection.
  
- **Malignancy**: The statement is inconclusive about malignancy. It describes features that could be suggestive of cancer but does not confirm it. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

- **Gleason grade**: Since there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy and no Gleason grade is mentioned, the answer is "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
