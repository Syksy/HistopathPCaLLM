To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. So, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
