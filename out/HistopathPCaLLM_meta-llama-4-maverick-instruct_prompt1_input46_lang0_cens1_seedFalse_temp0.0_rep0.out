To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Prostate material" and that it was "set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run." This context suggests it's a biopsy or a similar diagnostic sample. However, it doesn't explicitly state "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, it seems most likely to be a "biopsy" due to the mention of material being set on cassettes, which is a common procedure for biopsy samples. Therefore, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "Regular prostate tissue with glands seen under microscope" and mentions "findings which might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia." It explicitly states, "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant tumor findings. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and the statement leans towards a benign or uncertain condition, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inability to confirm malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate answers based on the provided statement, adhering to the required structure and allowed values.
