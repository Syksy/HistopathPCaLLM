To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No malign findings on the left or the right." Therefore, the answer is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there were no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given free format text, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) as per the instructions.
