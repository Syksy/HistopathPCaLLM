To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostatic material" and mentions quantities ("approx 30+40=70"), which could imply a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since it's common for TURP samples to be quantified in terms of weight or volume. However, without explicit mention, we can't be certain. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or RP either. Given the context, "TURP" seems a plausible guess, but it's not definitive.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that malignancy could not be confirmed or ruled out, so the most appropriate answer is "NA" as it reflects the uncertainty.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there's no mention of Gleason grades or any indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response assumes "TURP" as the sample type based on the context provided, though it's not a definitive identification. The "Malignancy" is marked as "NA" due to the inability to determine malignancy as per the statement. The "Gleason" grade is also "NA" as there's no malignancy identified or Gleason score provided.
