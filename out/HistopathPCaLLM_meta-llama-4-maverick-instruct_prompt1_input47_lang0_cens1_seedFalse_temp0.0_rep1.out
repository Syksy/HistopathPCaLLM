To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostatic material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to material from both the right and left, with a total amount indicating a significant quantity, which is more suggestive of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample rather than a biopsy. "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is less likely because the description doesn't fit a whole gland examination. Since it's not explicitly stated and could be considered ambiguous, one might lean towards "TURP" due to the quantity of material mentioned, but it's not a clear indication.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive presence or absence of malignancy. Therefore, the answer to this should be "NA" as it is not conclusively stated.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. This is expected since there's no mention of malignancy being identified. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind choosing "NA" for "Sampletype" is due to the lack of explicit information about the sample type. While "TURP" might be a plausible guess based on the quantity of material, it's not a definitive identification. Therefore, to be cautious and follow the instructions precisely, "NA" is used when the information is not explicitly clear or stated.
