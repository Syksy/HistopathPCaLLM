To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "prostatic material" and mentions quantities ("approx 30+40=70"), which could imply a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since it involves removal of prostate tissue and the quantity is significant. However, without explicit mention, we can't be certain. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or RP. Given the context, "TURP" seems a plausible guess, but it's not definitive.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that it was "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that the presence of malignancy could not be confirmed or denied, so the most appropriate answer is "NA" as it is uncertain.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, and no Gleason grades are mentioned, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, malignancy is not confirmed), would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that "Sampletype" is an educated guess due to the context implying a significant amount of prostate tissue was examined, which is more typical of TURP. If the sample type is not clearly identifiable, a more conservative or "NA" might be considered for "Sampletype" as well. 

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This version reflects the uncertainty more accurately across all fields.
