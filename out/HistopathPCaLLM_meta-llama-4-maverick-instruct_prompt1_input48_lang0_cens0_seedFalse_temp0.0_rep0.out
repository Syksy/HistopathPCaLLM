To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." and describes the preparation of the sample including various parts of the prostate. The term "prostate resection" is most closely related to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) in the prostate, mentioning "Histologically found adenocarcinoma in two first basis macro sections." Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason grade 5 is predominant (>80%) with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and given that the second focus has a higher Gleason sum (5+4=9), the reported Gleason grade is "5+4=9".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format gives:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
