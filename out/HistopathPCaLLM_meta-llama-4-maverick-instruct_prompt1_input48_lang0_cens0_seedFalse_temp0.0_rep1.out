To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection" which indicates the sample is from a prostate resection. The sample type is referred to as "prostate resection" which can be interpreted as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Histologically found adenocarcinoma" indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. It mentions that in one focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4 and the next common is 3. In the second focus, Gleason 5 is predominant (>80%) with a small portion of Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since the task is to report based on the most severe lesion and the second focus has a higher Gleason sum (5+4=9), the relevant Gleason grade to report is "5+4=9".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by:
- Identifying the sample type as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- Confirming the presence of malignancy as "yes".
- Reporting the Gleason grade based on the most severe lesion as "5+4=9".
