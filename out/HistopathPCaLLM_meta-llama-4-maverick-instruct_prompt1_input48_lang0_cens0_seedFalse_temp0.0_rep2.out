To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." Prostate resection can be associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another type of prostate surgery, but it typically involves removing prostate tissue through the urethra and is often associated with a different context (e.g., relief of urinary obstruction). The statement does not explicitly mention "biopsy," which involves taking a sample of tissue for examination. Given the context (prostate resection, detailed examination of various parts of the prostate), the sample type is most likely "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) in the prostate. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first tumor focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, the predominant Gleason grade is 5 (>80%), with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and given that the second focus has a higher Gleason score (5+4 or 4+5, implying a sum of 9), and the summary directly mentions "Gleason 9," we can infer that the most severe lesion has a Gleason score sum of 9. The exact major and minor components aren't directly stated for the overall tumor, but based on the information about the second focus and the summary, we can deduce that the Gleason score is "5+4=9" because it mentions ">80% representation" of Gleason 5.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
