To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The sample types allowed are "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available). Since the sample is obtained from "autopsies," it doesn't directly fit into the categories of "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Therefore, the most appropriate answer for the sample type in this context would be "NA" as it doesn't directly correspond to any of the specified sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some exemplifying histological changes" but does not explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. It also mentions that due to the nature of the demonstration, it's not used to derive differentiation scores, implying the focus isn't on diagnosing malignancy. However, it doesn't directly state that the findings are benign or malignant. The closest interpretation based on the information given is that the statement doesn't confirm malignancy. Therefore, the answer for malignancy should be "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that the samples are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e., Gleason 1-5)," indicating that a Gleason score is not provided or applicable in this context. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the appropriate values based on the information given in the statement.
