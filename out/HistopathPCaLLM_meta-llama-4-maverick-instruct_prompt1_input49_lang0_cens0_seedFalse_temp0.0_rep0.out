To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses." This context indicates that the sample was obtained through a procedure that involves removing or scraping prostate tissue, which is characteristic of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma." Carcinoma indicates the presence of malignant tumor cells. Thus, the malignancy status is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason classes found in the sample. It mentions that the "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 3 (major) + 4 (minor) = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion mentioned in the statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
