To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses." This context indicates that the sample was obtained through a procedure that involves removing or sampling prostate tissue in a manner consistent with TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it refers to "chippings" and "shavings."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason classes found in the sample. It mentions that the "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." This implies a Gleason score that can be interpreted as 3+4. The sum of these grades is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "3+4=7."

Given this analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
