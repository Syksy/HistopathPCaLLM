To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses." The context suggests these are samples obtained for pathological examination. The types of samples mentioned in the allowed values are "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available). The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given that it's on "8 glasses," it implies a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as both can be examined on glass slides. However, "TURP" is more commonly associated with chips being examined, and the term "glasses" or "slides" is more general and can apply to biopsies. Since "RP" is typically a larger specimen and not usually described as being on "glasses" in this context (though it is examined on slides), and there's no clear indication that it's a TURP, the most likely sample type based on the given information is "biopsy." Therefore, "Sampletype": "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the "fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation." It does not explicitly state that there are malignant findings, but it suggests that there are significant findings that need further assessment. However, it does not confirm malignancy. The allowed values are "yes," "no," or "NA." Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy but rather indicates a need for further investigation, and there's no clear indication of malignancy, the most appropriate answer based on the given text is "NA" because it doesn't definitively state "yes" or "no." Therefore, "Malignancy": "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its mention is typically associated with a diagnosis of malignancy. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide Gleason grades, the appropriate value is "NA." Therefore, "Gleason": "NA."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
