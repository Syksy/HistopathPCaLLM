To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses." The context suggests these are samples obtained for pathological examination. The types of samples mentioned in the allowed values are "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available). The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, but given that it's on "8 glasses," it implies a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as both can be examined on multiple slides/glasses. However, without explicit mention, we must infer or directly state "NA" if it doesn't clearly fit. Since "RP" is typically a single specimen and not usually described as being on "glasses" (slides), and the quantity (8 glasses) is plausible for both biopsy and TURP, we still need to decide based on the context. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a "TURP" or "biopsy," but given the context, it's more likely to be a biopsy due to the phrasing "rest of the prostate samples." However, the exact nature isn't clear, so a cautious approach might be to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the "fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation." It does not explicitly state that there are malignant findings. The phrase "warrant further investigation" suggests that there is some abnormality, but it doesn't confirm malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The findings are not clearly benign either, but since there's no clear indication of malignancy, and the task requires a definitive "yes" or "no" or "NA," the most appropriate response would be "NA" due to the ambiguity and the fact that further investigation is needed to determine the nature of the findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its mention is typically associated with a diagnosis of malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason grade is provided, the appropriate response is "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the ambiguity and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided statement.
