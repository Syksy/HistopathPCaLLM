To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly states that "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma" and describes the observed tissue as "benign prostate tissue." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the samples are described as benign and there's no mention of adenocarcinoma or any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA" because Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate cancer.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
