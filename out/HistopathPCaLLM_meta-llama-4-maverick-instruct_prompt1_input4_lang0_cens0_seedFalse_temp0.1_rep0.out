To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed" and further clarifies that "the samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no indication of multiple lesions with varying severity).
