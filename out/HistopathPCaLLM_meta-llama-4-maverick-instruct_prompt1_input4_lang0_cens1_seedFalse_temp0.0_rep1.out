To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample part" and "sampled tissue," indicating it's talking about a biopsy. There's no mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Thus, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement says, "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies there's no clear evidence of malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or its precursor lesions (PIN-like changes), but it's also stated that the material is insufficient for a reliable assessment. However, based on the information given, there's no positive indication of malignancy. So, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "no" because it directly states that no atypic patterns (which could be suggestive of malignancy or pre-malignancy) are present.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the statement indicates insufficient material to assess for adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is "NA" (Not Available), which is appropriate for a benign or non-diagnostic statement regarding malignancy.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
