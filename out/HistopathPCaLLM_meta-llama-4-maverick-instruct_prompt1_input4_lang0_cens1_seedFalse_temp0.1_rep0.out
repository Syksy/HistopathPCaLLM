To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sampled tissue" and "sample material," indicating that it is discussing a sample obtained from the prostate. However, it does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Since it mentions "sampling sites" and "sample material" in a context that implies diagnostic sampling rather than a whole gland or a therapeutic resection, and given that "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy which is a major surgical procedure and "TURP" is a specific type of surgical resection, the most likely sample type here is "biopsy" due to the context of sampling and assessing tissue representativeness. Thus, "Sampletype" is likely "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and mentions that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies that there were no clear findings of malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or pre-malignant changes (PIN-like changes) detected, though it notes the assessment is not reliable due to insufficient material. However, based on the information given, it leans towards "no" for malignancy findings because it directly states no atypic patterns were observed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It discusses the absence of atypic patterns and the insufficiency of the sample to assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, indicating that a Gleason grade cannot be or was not provided. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" as there's no malignancy confirmed or graded.

Putting it all together:

- "Sampletype": "biopsy" because the context suggests a diagnostic sampling.
- "Malignancy": "no" since no malignancy or atypic patterns were noted, despite the sample being insufficient for a definitive assessment regarding adenocarcinoma.
- "Gleason": "NA" because there's no reported Gleason grade for a benign or inconclusive statement regarding malignancy.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
