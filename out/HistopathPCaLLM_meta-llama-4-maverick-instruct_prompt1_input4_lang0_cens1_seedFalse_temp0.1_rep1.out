To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the provided instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it's discussing prostate tissue and the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, and without specific mention of it being a radical prostatectomy (RP) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), the most likely sample type is a "biopsy" due to the mention of "sampling sites" and "sample material" being assessed for representativeness of prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is inferred as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies there's no clear evidence of malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or pre-malignant changes (PIN-like changes) due to insufficient material, but it leans towards not having notable atypic patterns. Thus, it can be considered as "no" for malignancy findings because it doesn't confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of adenocarcinoma and the statement highlights insufficient material to assess for adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable or is "NA".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions by providing the required fields in a non-nested format and uses the allowed values for each field.
