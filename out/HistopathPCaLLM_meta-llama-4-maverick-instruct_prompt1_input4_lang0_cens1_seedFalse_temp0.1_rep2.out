To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample part" and "sampled tissue," indicating it's talking about a biopsy. There's no specific mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement says, "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and "the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies that there were no clear malignant findings, but it also indicates that the sample was not sufficient for a definitive assessment. However, based on the information given, there's no positive indication of malignancy. Thus, we can consider "Malignancy" as "no" because it explicitly states no atypic patterns were observed, even though it mentions insufficiency for a reliable assessment regarding adenocarcinoma.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the statement indicates that the sample material is insufficient for a reliable assessment of adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" (Not Available).

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
