To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement provides Gleason grades for two macros (A and B) from the apex. 
   - For Macro A, the Gleason grade is "4+3".
   - For Macro B, the Gleason grade is "4+5" with a sum of 9, which is higher than the sum for Macro A.
   - Since the task is to report the results from the most severe lesion, we consider Macro B because it has a higher Gleason sum (9). Thus, the reported Gleason grade is "4+5=9".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the given instructions, focusing on the most severe lesion found in the histopathological examination.
