To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)." This indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades for two different macroblocks (A and B) of the apex. For macro A, the Gleason grade is "4+3", and for macro B, it is "4+5" with a sum of 9. Since macro B has a higher sum (9) compared to macro A (7), it represents the more severe lesion. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
