To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions that "Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + cross sections)." This indicates a detailed examination of prostate samples. The sample type is not directly stated as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), but given the context of sampling from different parts of the prostate (apex and basis) and the detailed processing, it is likely referring to a biopsy or possibly a prostatectomy specimen. However, the detailed processing and the fact that it mentions "samples taken from both apex and basis" could be more indicative of a biopsy or a prostatectomy. The statement does not directly support "TURP" as it typically involves chipping away at the prostate from within. Without a clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) and given the sampling nature, "biopsy" seems a plausible interpretation. However, the text does not directly state it, and the processing details could fit a post-RP specimen analysis. Since it's not explicitly mentioned and based on the context, we might lean towards "NA" if we strictly interpret the given options and the information provided.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." This suggests that there is no clear indication of malignancy as it describes the tissue as "clear prostate tissue." It also mentions that "Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection," which implies some suspicion or uncertainty regarding malignancy or its grading but does not confirm malignancy. The clinical report mentions the prostate capsule is likely intact and no perineural invasion, which is often associated with cancer, but the statement does not directly confirm malignancy. Thus, based on the information given, it seems to lean towards "no" due to the description of "clear prostate tissue," but there's an element of suspicion.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This directly indicates that a Gleason score could not be determined or reported, likely because the tissue did not clearly show malignancy or the patterns were not definitive enough for a Gleason grading. It also mentions a "suspected higher sum," implying some level of suspicion or abnormality but not a confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" due to the lack of a clear malignancy diagnosis or a reported score.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement does not clearly differentiate between multiple lesions in terms of severity) and adhering to the allowed values, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the available information and the constraints provided:
- "Sampletype" is "NA" because the statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type.
- "Malignancy" is "no" because the tissue is described as "clear prostate tissue," indicating no clear malignancy.
- "Gleason" is "NA" because the Gleason score could not be determined due to the lack of clear malignancy or definitive patterns for grading.
