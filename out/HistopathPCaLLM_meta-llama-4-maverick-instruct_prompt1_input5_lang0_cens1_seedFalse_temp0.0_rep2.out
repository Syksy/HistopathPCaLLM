To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a specimen from a "relatively enlargened prostate." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context (sampling from apex and basis, processing of multiple sections), it is suggestive of a more substantial specimen than a typical biopsy. However, the exact nature (RP or TURP) isn't directly stated. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "biopsy," and given that TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is often associated with an "enlargened prostate," one might lean towards TURP. However, the statement doesn't conclusively confirm any of these. Therefore, without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the given information would be "NA" due to the lack of a direct statement.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected higher sum" Gleason score and reference to a colleague for further inspection, implying a suspicion of malignancy. However, it does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The presence of "clear prostate tissue" and the lack of a definitive statement on malignancy make this tricky. The text implies a potential malignancy or at least a suspicion thereof due to the mention of Gleason classes and further inspection. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignancy due to the context suggesting a suspected malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This indicates that despite the suspicion of malignancy, a definitive Gleason score was not determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because it was not conclusively reported.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Not using nested structures.
- Providing answers for the most severe lesion (implied by the context of suspicion and further inspection).
- Using the allowed values for each field ("NA" for Sampletype and Gleason due to lack of conclusive information, and "yes" for Malignancy based on the suspicion and context provided).
