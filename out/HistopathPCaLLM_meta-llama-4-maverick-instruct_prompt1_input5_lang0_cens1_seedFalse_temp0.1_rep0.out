To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions that "Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + cross sections)." This indicates a detailed examination of prostate samples. The sample type is not directly stated as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), but given the context of sampling from apex and basis and the detailed processing, it is likely referring to a prostate biopsy or possibly a prostatectomy specimen. However, the detailed processing and the fact that samples are taken from both apex and basis and are indexed suggest it could be related to a surgical specimen. Yet, the most plausible interpretation based on the information given and the options available is "biopsy" due to the lack of explicit mention of a prostatectomy or TURP.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." The term "clear prostate tissue" in this context implies the absence of malignancy in the observed samples. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement indicates that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This implies that despite some suspicion or different architectures observed, a definitive Gleason score was not determined. For benign or non-malignant cases, the Gleason grade is typically reported as "NA." Since the sample is considered benign based on the observation of "clear prostate tissue," the Gleason grade should be "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the answers based on the most severe lesion (which in this case is considered benign across all samples examined).
