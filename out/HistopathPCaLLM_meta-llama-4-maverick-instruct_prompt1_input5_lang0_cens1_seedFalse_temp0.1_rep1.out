To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" and refers to a specimen from a "relatively enlargened prostate." It does not directly state the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context of sampling from apex and basis and the processing details, it is suggestive of a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as TURP typically involves chips of tissue and the detailed sampling from apex and basis is more characteristic of RP. Biopsy usually refers to needle biopsies. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. It mentions "suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection," indicating suspicion but not confirmation of malignancy. However, it also states that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings," which suggests that there might not be a clear indication of malignancy in the samples examined so far. The statement does not definitively say "yes" to malignancy; hence, we should consider it as "no" for the purpose of this structuring task because there's no clear indication of malignant findings being confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," and there's a mention of a "suspected higher sum," but it does not provide a specific Gleason score. Since the Gleason score is not definitively provided and malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA".

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (as it's the most likely scenario given the context)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since there's no clear confirmation of malignancy)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since the Gleason score is not provided and malignancy is not confirmed)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
