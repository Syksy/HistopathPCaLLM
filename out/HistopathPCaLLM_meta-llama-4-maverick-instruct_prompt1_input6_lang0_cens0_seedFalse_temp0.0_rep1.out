To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and that they are "run via three tissue casettes." The context suggests a surgical procedure, and given the options, "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is the most likely sample type because it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips or shavings. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no indication of malignancy. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant findings or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
