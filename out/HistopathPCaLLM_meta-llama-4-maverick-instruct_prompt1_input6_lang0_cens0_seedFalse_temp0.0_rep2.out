To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and that they are "run via three tissue casettes." This context suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) because it involves shaving chips, which is a characteristic of TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant findings. Thus, the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign) and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
