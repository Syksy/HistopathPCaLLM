To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue cassettes." This context suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) because it involves "shaving chips," a term commonly associated with TURP procedures.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement describes "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and mentions "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, it leans towards a benign condition.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement does not indicate any malignant findings but rather suggests "benign prostate hyperplasia," the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: The sample is from a TURP procedure.
- **Malignancy**: The findings are benign, so "no".
- **Gleason**: Since it's benign, "NA".

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
