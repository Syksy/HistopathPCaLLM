To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes." This context suggests that the sample is not a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, nor is it explicitly a biopsy in the traditional sense (though biopsies can be in the form of chips, the term "shaving chips" is more indicative of a TURP - Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). TURP typically involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips or fragments. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignant findings; instead, it indicates a benign condition. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign (benign prostate hyperplasia), there is no malignant tumor present to assign a Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics (or lack thereof, in this case, as the sample is benign) as per the given statement.
