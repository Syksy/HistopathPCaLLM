To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." It indicates the sample is from an operation, not a biopsy. The term "prostatic operation material" is most likely referring to a prostatectomy specimen, which is often associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another type of operation, but the term "operation material" is more commonly used with RP. However, without explicit mention, one might consider it could be either RP or TURP. Given the context that it's "very fragmented parts" and "run in three separate batches," it could lean more towards TURP, but the description "prostatic operation material" is a bit more suggestive of RP. However, the presence of "very fragmented parts" is not uncommon in TURP. The statement does not directly indicate it is a biopsy. Therefore, based on the information that it's an "operation material," we can infer it's likely either RP or TURP. Since it's not explicitly clear and given the fragmentation and batch processing, one might argue it could be TURP. Let's consider it as "RP" for the sake of clarity and because it's described as "prostatic operation material," which might be a more specific indication.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also states that "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact." It concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of malignancy is not confirmed due to the artefacts, so we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement is inconclusive regarding malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the results are inconclusive and there's no clear indication of malignancy or its grade, the Gleason grade is not reported. Hence, it should be considered as "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the provided statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the outcome is inconclusive).
