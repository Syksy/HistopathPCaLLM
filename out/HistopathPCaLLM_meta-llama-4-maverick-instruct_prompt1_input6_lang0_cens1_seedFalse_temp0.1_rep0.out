To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material." This indicates that the sample is from a prostate surgery, which could be either a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) or another surgical procedure. The term "prostatic operation material" is most closely associated with "RP" as it refers to the removal of the prostate gland. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a surgical procedure but is more commonly associated with symptom relief rather than cancer treatment. The statement does not directly indicate "TURP," and "biopsy" is clearly not the case as it refers to a diagnostic sampling rather than an "operation material." Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes observing "relatively normal prostate tissue structures" but also mentions that the majority of the sample material cannot be inspected due to a "heavy burn artefact." It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant findings. However, it implies that due to technical challenges (the artefact), the results are "inconclusive." This suggests that a definitive diagnosis of malignancy could not be made or ruled out. In the absence of a clear statement regarding malignancy, and given that the results are "inconclusive," the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Since the Gleason grade is related to the malignancy and the statement is inconclusive regarding malignancy and does not provide Gleason grades, the appropriate answer for "Gleason" would be "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (as it's related to "prostatic operation material")
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (since the results are inconclusive)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the sample is not conclusively malignant)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
