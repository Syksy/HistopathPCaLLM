To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material." This indicates that the sample is related to a prostate surgery. The terms "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), and "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are specific types of prostate samples. "RP" is a type of operation, and the statement refers to "prostatic operation material," which could imply RP. However, the term "very fragmented parts" and the fact that it's run in "three separate batches" could also be consistent with a TURP or another surgical specimen. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy. Given the context, it seems more likely to be related to a surgical specimen like RP or TURP rather than a biopsy. Since it specifically mentions "prostatic operation material," we'll lean towards "RP" as the most likely surgical specimen related to an operation. However, without a clear indication that it's not TURP, and considering "RP" is a specific type of operation, if we had to choose between "RP" and "TURP" based on the information given, "RP" seems plausible due to the mention of "original prostatic operation material." Thus, "Sampletype" could be considered as "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not clearly indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures" but also states that "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and the results are inconclusive, the most appropriate answer for "Malignancy" would be "NA" due to the lack of conclusive evidence.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Given that the sample's malignancy status is inconclusive and there's no specific mention of Gleason grades, the "Gleason" field should be "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the instructions provided, focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, the lesion's severity or presence is inconclusive), and presents the information in a non-nested JSON format.
