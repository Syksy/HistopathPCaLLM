To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material." This indicates that the sample is likely from a prostatectomy (RP), as it refers to "original prostatic operation material." TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a type of prostate surgery, but the term "operation material" is more commonly associated with RP. However, without explicit mention, one might consider it could be either RP or TURP. Yet, given the context that it's "very fragmented" and in "three separate batches," it could lean more towards TURP, which is known for producing fragmented tissue. However, the most straightforward interpretation based on the given options and the context is that it's not a biopsy. Since it's related to an "original prostatic operation material," we'll consider it as "RP" for the sake of providing a definitive answer, acknowledging that "TURP" could also be a plausible interpretation.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also notes that "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." There's no clear indication of malignancy, but the presence of cancer isn't ruled out due to the artefacts. However, the statement doesn't directly say there's no malignancy or that there is. It leans towards being inconclusive. Thus, we can't definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy and is inconclusive, and there's no mention of Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (Considering it as the most likely "original prostatic operation material")
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (Due to the inconclusive results)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (As there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade mentioned)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
