To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, the context implies a suspicion of malignancy. For the purpose of this task and based on the information given, we will consider this as indicating malignancy, hence "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not include a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" as it is not provided.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion described in the statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
