To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it concludes that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, the mention of "adenocarcinoma" indicates a suspicion of malignancy. For the purpose of this task, since there's a mention of a malignant tumor finding (even if not conclusive), we'll consider it as "yes" because the text implies the presence of something that "suggests adenocarcinoma."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not include a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because there's no actual Gleason score provided for a confirmed malignant finding.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
