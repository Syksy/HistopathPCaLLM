To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, the presence of "adenocarcinoma" is suggested. For the purpose of this task, since there's a mention of a malignancy (even if suspected), we'll consider it as malignant.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The description is limited to suggesting adenocarcinoma without specifying the Gleason grades.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The sample type is "biopsy" because the statement refers to "prostate biopsies."
- **Malignancy**: It's considered "yes" because the statement suggests the presence of adenocarcinoma, even though it's not conclusive.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the Gleason grade is not provided, it should be considered as "NA" because there's no information to calculate or infer the Gleason score.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given statement.
