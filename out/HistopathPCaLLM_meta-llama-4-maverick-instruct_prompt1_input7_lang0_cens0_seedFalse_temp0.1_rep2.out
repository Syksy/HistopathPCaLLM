To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that "the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet," the presence of morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma indicates a suspicion of malignancy. However, for the purpose of this task and given the allowed values, since there's a mention of suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis, we need to carefully consider this. The statement does indicate a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, which is malignant. Thus, we can infer that there are malignant tumor findings suspected, but the language used ("suspicion-level") might not constitute a definitive "yes." However, given the context and the fact that we're dealing with a histopathological statement, the most appropriate interpretation is that there is a suspicion of malignancy, which leans towards a "yes" due to the presence of morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The description is of a suspicious finding but does not include a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because there's no definitive malignancy diagnosis provided with a Gleason score.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the interpretation that the presence of morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is sufficient to consider it as malignant findings ("yes"), despite the overall conclusion being on a suspicion level. The Gleason grade is "NA" because it was not provided in the statement.
