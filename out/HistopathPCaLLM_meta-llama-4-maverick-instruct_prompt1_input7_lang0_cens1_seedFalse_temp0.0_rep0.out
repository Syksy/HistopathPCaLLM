To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support any of the specific sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP), so we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The closest answer would be "NA" because the statement does not definitively confirm or deny malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. This is likely because the finding was too small to make a definitive diagnosis, and Gleason grading is typically applied to malignant prostate cancer diagnoses. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided statement.
