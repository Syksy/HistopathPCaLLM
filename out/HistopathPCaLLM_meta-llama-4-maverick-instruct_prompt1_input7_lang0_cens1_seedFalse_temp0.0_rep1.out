To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, one might argue it could be "NA" for not available. However, given the context that it's a histopathological statement and sample material was collected, we'll have to make an educated guess. The statement doesn't directly support any of the specific sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP), so a strict interpretation might lean towards "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not confirmation of malignancy. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings should be "NA" or potentially "no" if we interpret "no definite conclusions" as leaning towards a lack of confirmation. However, given the phrasing, "NA" seems more appropriate as it reflects the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of definitive information in the original statement regarding the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.
