To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, one might argue it could be "NA" due to lack of clear information. However, given the context that it's a histopathological statement and sample material was collected, we'll have to make an educated guess or directly state "NA" if not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes" or "no". In such cases, "NA" might be considered due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades, which are typically associated with a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The absence of a Gleason grade, combined with the uncertainty around the malignancy, suggests that the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of definitive information in the original statement regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade.
