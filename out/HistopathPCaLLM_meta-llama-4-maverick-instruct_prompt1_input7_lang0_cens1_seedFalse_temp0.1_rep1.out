To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, one might argue it could be "NA" for Not Available. However, given the context that it's a histopathological statement and sample material was collected, we'll have to make an educated guess. The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type as "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" directly, so we'll consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The closest answer would be "NA" since the statement doesn't definitively classify the finding as malignant or benign.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. This is typically reported for malignant findings, and since there's no definitive malignancy diagnosis here, it's appropriate to consider it as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the ambiguity and lack of definitive information in the original statement regarding the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.
