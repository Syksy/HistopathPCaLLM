To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context and the information given, we can infer that it is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, one might argue it could be "NA" for Not Available. However, given the context that it's a histopathological statement and sample material was collected, we'll have to make an educated guess. The statement doesn't directly support any of the specific sample types (biopsy, RP, TURP), so a conservative approach would be to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" since it's neither clearly "yes" nor "no" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it did not result in a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Not using nested structures.
- Providing answers for the most severe lesion (though in this case, the diagnosis was inconclusive).
- Using the allowed values for each field.
