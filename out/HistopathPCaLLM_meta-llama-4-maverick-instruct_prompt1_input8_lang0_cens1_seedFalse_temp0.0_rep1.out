To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to a "prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol" and mentions samples and indices, which is common in biopsy reports. There's no explicit mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." For sample 3, it discusses various histological properties and Gleason patterns, suggesting that there might be malignant findings or at least a suspicion of malignancy. However, it explicitly states that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," which could imply that there was an expectation or suspicion of malignancy but does not directly confirm it for sample 3. Despite this ambiguity, the discussion around Gleason patterns and the fact that it's the most severe lesion considered, implies that malignancy is suspected or present. Thus, "Malignancy" could be considered as "yes" due to the context of discussing Gleason grades.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that "major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This indicates that a Gleason score was not properly recorded or reported, despite some level of tumor being present. Since the actual Gleason score is not provided and it's indicated as missing, one might be inclined to mark it as "NA." However, the task requires extracting information from the most severe lesion, and here it seems there's an implication of malignancy without a clear Gleason score.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy" (as it's the most plausible given the context)
- **Malignancy**: "yes" (since there's discussion around Gleason patterns and it's the most severe lesion)
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" (since the actual Gleason score is not reported or is missing)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required format and the instructions provided for handling the information given in the statement.
