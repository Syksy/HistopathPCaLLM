To address the task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to the samples being processed and examined histologically, which is consistent with a biopsy. There's no explicit mention of it being a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." Therefore, "Sampletype": "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." For Sample 3, it discusses various histological properties and suspicion of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) changes but does not explicitly confirm malignancy. However, it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," which implies that there was an expectation or suspicion of malignancy, but it does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings in Sample 3. Despite this, the discussion around Gleason patterns suggests an investigation for malignancy. Since the most severe lesion is in question and Sample 3 is the focus for potentially malignant findings, we will consider "Malignancy": "yes" due to the context implying an evaluation for malignancy and the mention of Gleason patterns, even though it's not a clear confirmation.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This indicates that a Gleason score was not properly recorded or reported for the sample where malignancy was potentially suspected (Sample 3). Therefore, despite the implication of an attempted Gleason grading, the actual Gleason score is not available. Hence, "Gleason": "NA" due to the lack of a reported score.

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics based on the provided statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
