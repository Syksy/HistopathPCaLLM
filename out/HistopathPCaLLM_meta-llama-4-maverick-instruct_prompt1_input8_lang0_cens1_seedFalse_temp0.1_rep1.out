To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" and refers to them as parts of a prostate examination. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context, it is likely referring to biopsy samples since it discusses examining multiple samples and segments, which is common in biopsy procedures.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement indicates that samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings." However, it discusses Gleason patterns and PIN-changes (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) for sample 3, suggesting some level of abnormality or concern for malignancy in sample 3, but it doesn't directly confirm malignancy. The presence of "Gleason patterns" typically implies a malignant context, but the statement is ambiguous regarding the final assessment of malignancy for sample 3.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and refers to empty fields for major and minor Gleason grades. It implies that there was an expectation or an attempt to report Gleason grades but doesn't provide the actual grades due to what seems to be a recording issue.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" based on the context provided.
- **Malignancy**: The statement is ambiguous regarding the confirmation of malignancy in the most relevant sample (Sample 3). While it discusses Gleason patterns and PIN changes, suggesting a concern for malignancy, it doesn't directly state that malignancy was found. However, the discussion around Gleason patterns typically relates to malignant findings.
- **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not directly reported due to what appears to be a recording or reporting issue.

Therefore, based on the information given and the need to select the most severe lesion (Sample 3 in this case), the structured data could be interpreted as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is chosen because:
- The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy" based on the context.
- "Malignancy" is marked as "NA" due to the ambiguity in the statement regarding the confirmation of malignancy in Sample 3.
- "Gleason" is marked as "NA" because the Gleason grade is not reported due to the mentioned recording mishap or issue.

This JSON structure adheres to the required format and the instructions provided.
