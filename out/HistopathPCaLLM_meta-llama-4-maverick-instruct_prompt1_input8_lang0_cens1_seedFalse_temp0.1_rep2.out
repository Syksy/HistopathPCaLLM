To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to a "prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol" and mentions samples and indices, which is common in biopsy reports. There's no explicit mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." For sample 3, it discusses various histological properties and Gleason patterns, suggesting that there might be malignant findings or at least a suspicion of malignancy. However, it explicitly states that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," which could imply that there was an expectation or suspicion of malignancy but does not directly confirm it for sample 3. Despite this ambiguity, the discussion around Gleason patterns and the fact that it's the most severe lesion considered, implies that malignancy is suspected or present. Thus, "Malignancy" could be considered as "yes" due to the context of discussing Gleason grades.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that "major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This indicates that a Gleason score was not properly recorded or reported for the sample. Despite this, the fact that Gleason patterns are discussed implies an expectation of malignancy. However, since the actual Gleason score is not provided, and it's not clear if a score was intended to be derived, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of a reported score.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (Sample 3 in this case), would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by:
- Identifying the sample type as "biopsy" based on the context.
- Confirming malignancy as "yes" due to the discussion around Gleason patterns and the implication of malignant findings in Sample 3.
- Reporting the Gleason grade as "NA" since the actual score was not provided or recorded.
