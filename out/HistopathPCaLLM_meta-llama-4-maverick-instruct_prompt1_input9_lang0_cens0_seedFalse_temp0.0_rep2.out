To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material. This is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue using electrocautery or electrosection.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed," which directly answers the question regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia," it implies that there is no malignant tumor. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value should be "NA" as per the instructions for benign statements.

Now, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP" because the sample was obtained through electrosection shavings, which is characteristic of a TURP procedure.
- **Malignancy**: "no" since the statement clearly indicates no malignant findings were observed.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the sample was benign, and thus, Gleason grading is not applicable.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
