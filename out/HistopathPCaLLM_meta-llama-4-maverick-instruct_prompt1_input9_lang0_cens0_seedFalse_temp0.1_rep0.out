To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "electrosection shavings were obtained as the sample material." This context suggests a surgical procedure where tissue is removed and examined. "Electrosection" is related to procedures like TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), where tissue is removed using an electric current. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since the statement concludes with "No malignant findings are observed," it implies the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer should be "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in the required format.
