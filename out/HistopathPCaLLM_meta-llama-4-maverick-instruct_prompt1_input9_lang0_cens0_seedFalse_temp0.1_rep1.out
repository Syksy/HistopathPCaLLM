To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material. This is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves the removal of prostate tissue using electrocautery or electrosection.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there are no malignant findings and describes the condition as "benign hyperplasia," the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer, and it's not relevant for benign conditions. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the given histopathological statement in the required format, focusing on the most severe lesion (which in this case is benign, hence no malignancy or Gleason score is reported).
