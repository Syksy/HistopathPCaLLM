To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings were obtained as the sample material." This context suggests a procedure where tissue is removed and examined. Given the context, "electrosection shavings" is most closely associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a surgical procedure used to treat an enlarged prostate. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "No malignant findings are observed," it implies the sample is benign. For benign samples, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (or the overall finding in this case, as there's no indication of multiple lesions with varying severity).
