To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about processing a large quantity of prostate tissue and mentions "Batches were run in 8 steps," which could imply a significant amount of tissue was processed, more suggestive of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) than a biopsy. RP (Radical Prostatectomy) typically involves examining the entire prostate gland, which might not be directly inferred here due to the lack of specific mention. The description doesn't conclusively point to any specific type, but given the context, TURP seems plausible due to the quantity of tissue. However, the statement doesn't directly confirm any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), so we should be cautious. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, the safest choice would be "NA" due to lack of clear information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and attributes some observed irregularities to "technical difficulties in processing of the sample." It concludes that "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" and suspects "faulty processing of the sample material." There's no clear indication of malignancy; in fact, the tone suggests that the examination was inconclusive rather than identifying a malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Gleason grades are used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Since there's no mention of cancer or Gleason grades, and given that the sample's examination was inconclusive, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, the inconclusive nature of the malignancy assessment, and the absence of any Gleason grade reporting.
