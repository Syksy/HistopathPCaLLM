To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about processing a large quantity of prostate tissue in batches and mentions technical difficulties in processing. The term "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is often associated with a large quantity of tissue being processed. Although not directly stated, the context hints towards "TURP" due to the large quantity of tissue. However, without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the given information would be "NA" since it's not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal, and there's a suspicion of faulty processing of the sample material. It does not conclusively state the presence of malignant tumor findings. In fact, it suggests that conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn, implying that malignancy is not confirmed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement does not definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and the statement does not mention Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not providing nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there's no clear indication of any lesion being malignant or severe). The values are chosen based on the information available in the statement.
