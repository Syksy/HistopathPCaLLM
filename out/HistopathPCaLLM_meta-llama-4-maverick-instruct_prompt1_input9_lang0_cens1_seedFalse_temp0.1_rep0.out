To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about processing a large quantity of prostate tissue and mentions "Batches were run in 8 steps," which could imply a significant amount of tissue was processed, more typical of a TURP or RP. But, there's no clear indication of the sample type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear context to deduce it directly from the given information, we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal," which suggests that there were no clear indications of malignancy. It also mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear to be disproportionate but attributes this to possible technical difficulties in processing the sample rather than to malignancy. Therefore, based on the information given, it seems there were no malignant tumor findings reported, so "no" could be considered.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Since Gleason grading is used for malignant tumors and the statement doesn't indicate malignancy, it's consistent that Gleason grade is not mentioned. Therefore, "NA" is appropriate.

Based on the analysis:

- Sample type: "NA" (since it's not specified)
- Malignancy: "no" (as the tissue appears normal and no malignancy is indicated)
- Gleason grade: "NA" (since there's no indication of malignancy)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
