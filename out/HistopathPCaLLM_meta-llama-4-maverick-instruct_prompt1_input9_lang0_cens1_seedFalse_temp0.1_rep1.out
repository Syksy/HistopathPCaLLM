To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about processing a large quantity of prostate tissue and mentions "Batches were run in 8 steps," which could imply a significant amount of tissue was processed, more typical of a TURP or RP. But, there's no clear indication of the sample type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, and there's no clear context to infer it directly from the given text, we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal," which suggests that there were no overtly malignant findings. It also mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear disproportionate but attributes this to possible technical difficulties in processing. There's no clear indication of malignancy. Thus, based on the information given, the answer would be "no".

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - Since there's no mention of malignancy or Gleason grades in the statement, and given that the sample's examination did not conclusively show malignancy, the Gleason grade would be considered "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the original statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
