To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to examining "prostate tissue." It indicates a significant amount of tissue was processed, which is more characteristic of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The statement does not directly mention "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, given the context of processing a substantial amount of tissue and the mention of "large quantities of prostate tissue," it is plausible to infer that the sample could be from a TURP or RP. Since it doesn't directly state "RP" or "TURP" and given the context that a significant amount of tissue was examined, we might lean towards "TURP" as a possibility due to the mention of processing issues and examining "grandular structures." However, without a clear indication, the most accurate answer based on the information given is "NA" because the text does not explicitly state the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the epithelial cell lining as "rather normal" and attributes some observed irregularities to "technical difficulties in processing of the sample." It concludes that "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" and suspects "faulty processing of the sample material." There is no clear indication of malignancy; in fact, the description leans towards a benign or inconclusive finding due to processing issues. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "no" because there's no clear evidence of malignancy mentioned.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the answer should be "NA."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics (or lack thereof) as described in the statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
