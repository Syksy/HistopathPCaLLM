To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g... In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed..." and later refers to a condition fitting "benign prostate hyperplasia." The term "Chipping samples" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chips. So, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" were observed, and the finding fits "benign prostate hyperplasia." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate tissue" and mentions no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
