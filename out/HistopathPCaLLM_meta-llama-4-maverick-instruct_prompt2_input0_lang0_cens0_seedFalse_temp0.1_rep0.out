To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g... In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed..." and later refers to a condition fitting "benign prostate hyperplasia." The term "Chipping samples" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in chips. So, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" and "benign prostate tissue was observed." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates the presence of "benign prostate tissue" and explicitly rules out malignancy or carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
