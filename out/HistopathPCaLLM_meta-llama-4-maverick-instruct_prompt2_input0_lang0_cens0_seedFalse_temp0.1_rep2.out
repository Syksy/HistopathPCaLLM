To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks." The term "chipping samples" is indicative of a specific type of sample collection. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a procedure that involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips or fragments. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." This means there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the tissue is benign with no carcinoma observed, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
