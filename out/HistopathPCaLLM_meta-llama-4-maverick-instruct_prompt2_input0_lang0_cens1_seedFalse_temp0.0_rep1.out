To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue," but it doesn't directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the information provided, it doesn't clearly fit into "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Therefore, the sample type is considered "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," which implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Thus, the malignancy status is "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma and doesn't provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is considered "NA."

Therefore, based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
