To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue was observed" and that "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it's prostate tissue and the process involved, we can infer it's likely a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly mentioned, and the exact nature (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't clear, the safest interpretation based on the information given is "NA" because the text doesn't directly state it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy based on the provided information. Hence, the appropriate answer is "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," it implies that there's no information available to determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the inability to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade from the given histopathological statement.
