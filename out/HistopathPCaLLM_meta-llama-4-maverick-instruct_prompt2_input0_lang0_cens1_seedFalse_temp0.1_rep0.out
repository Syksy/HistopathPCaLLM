To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue." It doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the fact that it doesn't clearly indicate RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and considering it's a common scenario for biopsies to be discussed in terms of "sample material," we might lean towards it being a biopsy. However, the statement doesn't explicitly confirm the sample type, so we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, so we'll have to consider it as not clearly defined or "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," which implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Thus, it is not a clear "yes" or "no" for malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma, and Gleason grading is applicable to malignant prostate cancer, the Gleason grade is "NA" in this context.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the inability to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade from the given statement due to its ambiguous and inconclusive nature regarding malignancy and specific sample details.
