To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A lot sample material was obtained" and refers to "prostate tissue," but it doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the information provided, we can't directly infer the sample type. Therefore, we should categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." This implies that the examination was inconclusive regarding malignancy. Hence, we should consider it as "NA" because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't mention Gleason grades or any form of grading related to prostate cancer. It discusses the inability to conclude regarding malignancy or carcinoma and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia" as a suspicion. Since there's no mention of a malignant tumor or Gleason grading, we should categorize the Gleason grade as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the provided instructions and the example given for a statement that is not a valid histopathological statement regarding malignancy or Gleason grading.
