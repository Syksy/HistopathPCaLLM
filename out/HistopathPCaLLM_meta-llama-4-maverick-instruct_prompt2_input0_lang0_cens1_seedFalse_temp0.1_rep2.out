To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue was observed" and that "A lot sample material was obtained," but it doesn't directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context and the information provided, we can infer that it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of "multiple batches" and examining "prostate tissue." Still, the exact sample type isn't clearly stated, so we should be cautious. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and directly calling it a biopsy might not be entirely accurate without more context, the safest choice seems to be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted," which implies that the examination did not conclusively identify malignancy, nor did it rule it out definitively. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. The most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't directly say "yes" or "no" to malignancy; it indicates an inability to make a conclusion.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of malignancy or carcinoma and doesn't provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response aligns with the instructions for handling statements that do not provide clear or direct information regarding the required fields.
