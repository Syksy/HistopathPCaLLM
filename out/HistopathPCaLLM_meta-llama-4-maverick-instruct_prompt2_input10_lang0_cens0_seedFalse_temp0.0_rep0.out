To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "suspicion-level" and "leaning towards benign." It also mentions that "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." This implies that there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy, so the malignancy is considered "no" because it leans towards benign and doesn't confirm carcinoma.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of carcinoma and leans towards a benign diagnosis, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
