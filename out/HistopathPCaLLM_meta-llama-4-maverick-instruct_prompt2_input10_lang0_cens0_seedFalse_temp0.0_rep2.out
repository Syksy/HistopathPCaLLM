To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," which directly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "suspicion-level" and "leaning towards benign," with the presence of "basal cell hyperplasia" and the inability to give a "definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." This implies that there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is not definitively "yes," so it should be considered as "no" because the diagnosis is leaning towards benign and there's no clear indication of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of carcinoma and leans towards a benign diagnosis, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data represents the information extracted from the given histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
