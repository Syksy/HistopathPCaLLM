To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," indicating the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "suspicion-level" and "leaning towards benign," with the presence of "basal cell hyperplasia" and positive staining for basal cells, which typically indicates a benign condition. It also mentions that the "suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma." Therefore, the malignancy is not definitively identified, but it leans towards being benign. Thus, the malignancy can be considered as "no" because it doesn't confirm the presence of a malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade, as it leans towards a benign diagnosis and doesn't confirm carcinoma. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
