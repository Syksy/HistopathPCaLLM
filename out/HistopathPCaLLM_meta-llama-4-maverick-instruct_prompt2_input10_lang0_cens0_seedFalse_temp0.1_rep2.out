To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies," indicating that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "suspicion-level" and "leaning towards benign," indicating uncertainty but leaning towards not being malignant. However, it does not definitively state the presence of malignancy. The key phrase here is "the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign," which suggests that malignancy is not confirmed. Thus, the malignancy should be considered as "no" because it leans towards benign and there's no clear indication of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions that "the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma," and there's no mention of Gleason grades. Since there's no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma (and thus no malignancy confirmed), the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the given requirements and provides the structured data as requested.
