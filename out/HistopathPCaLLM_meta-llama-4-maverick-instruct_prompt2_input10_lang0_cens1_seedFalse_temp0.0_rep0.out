To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and discusses issues related to their processing and examination. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it refers to "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material." The most likely sample type in this context, given the mention of "separate batches" and examination of tissue, is "biopsy." However, the text does not directly confirm this, and other types like "RP" or "TURP" are not mentioned. Since it's not explicitly stated and could be considered ambiguous, one might lean towards "NA" due to lack of clear indication. Yet, for the sake of providing a structured answer based on the most plausible interpretation, we might consider it as "biopsy" due to the context of examining prostate tissue.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions observing "normal basal cells" in the prostate tissue material. The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates a benign condition since basal cells are often absent in malignant prostate glands. There's no direct mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, the focus is on the suspicion of staining immunopanel failing in some samples. Therefore, based on the information given and the context that there's no clear indication of malignancy, the malignancy status can be considered as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or any scoring related to the tumor's aggressiveness. The discussion revolves around the technical aspects of sample processing and the reliability of immunological stainings. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" since there's no information provided about the Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "biopsy" is chosen here based on contextual clues, a more conservative interpretation without clear indication might suggest "NA" for "Sampletype." The choice between "biopsy" and "NA" for "Sampletype" can depend on how strictly one interprets the given information. 

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Both interpretations have their rationale, but based on the step-by-step analysis and leaning towards a more plausible sample type given the context, the first JSON is provided as the structured answer.
