To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and that they arrived in "8 separate batches due to a logistics error." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it refers to them as "prostate samples." However, it does not directly indicate the sample type. Given the context, it seems most likely that these are biopsy samples because it mentions "prostate tissue material" and "some of the earlier samples," which is consistent with biopsy sampling. However, the text does not directly confirm this, and there's no clear indication that it's RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Since it's not explicitly stated and doesn't directly fit into the more specific categories based on the information given, we might lean towards "biopsy" due to the context of sampling, but it's not a clear-cut decision.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions observing "normal basal cells in the prostate tissue material" and discusses issues with immunological stainings. The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates benign tissue because basal cells are often absent in malignant prostate glands. There's no direct mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, the focus is on the technical issues with staining. Therefore, based on the information given and the presence of normal basal cells, it suggests a benign finding or at least not a confirmed malignancy. Thus, "Malignancy" could be considered as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the mention of normal basal cells, suggests that there's no reported malignancy that would require Gleason grading. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" as there's no malignancy reported.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "biopsy" is chosen for "Sampletype" based on contextual clues, it's not a definitive identification. If adhering strictly to the information directly provided in the statement, one might argue for "NA" due to the lack of explicit sample type identification. Nonetheless, based on the process of elimination and the context provided:

The final answer is:
```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
