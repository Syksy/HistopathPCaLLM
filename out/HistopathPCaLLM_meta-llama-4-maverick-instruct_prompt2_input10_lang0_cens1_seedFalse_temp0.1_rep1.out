To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and refers to them being received in "8 separate batches." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it mentions "prostate tissue material" and "prostate samples." The most likely sample type based on the context is "biopsy." However, the statement does not directly confirm this, and there's no clear indication that it's RP or TURP either. Given the lack of explicit information, the safest interpretation might lean towards "NA" due to insufficient direct evidence.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions observing "normal basal cells in the prostate tissue material." The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates benign tissue since basal cells are often absent in malignant prostate glands. It does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings but implies a benign condition by mentioning normal basal cells. There's no clear indication of malignancy ("yes"), and it leans more towards not having malignant findings ("no") due to the mention of normal basal cells.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or any grading related to the prostate tissue. This information is crucial for malignant cases, but since the statement implies a benign condition or at least does not clearly indicate malignancy, and does not provide Gleason scores, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly specify the sample type, so it could be considered "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The presence of "normal basal cells" suggests a benign condition, so "Malignancy" could be considered "no."
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the context implies a benign condition, "Gleason" should be "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
