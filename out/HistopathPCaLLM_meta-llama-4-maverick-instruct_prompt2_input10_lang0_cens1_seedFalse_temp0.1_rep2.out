To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" and discusses issues related to their processing and examination. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but it refers to "prostate samples" and "prostate tissue material." The most likely sample type based on the context is "biopsy" since it's discussing examining tissue material and issues with staining, which is common in biopsy samples. However, the text does not directly confirm this, and there's no clear indication that it's RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the lack of explicit information, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the context of examining tissue and staining issues, but it's not a clear-cut decision.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions observing "normal basal cells" in the prostate tissue material. The presence of normal basal cells typically indicates a benign or non-malignant condition because one characteristic of prostate cancer is the absence or disruption of the basal cell layer. Therefore, based on this information, it suggests "no" malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the mention of normal basal cells, supports a benign diagnosis. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" for a benign or non-malignant statement.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "biopsy" is a reasonable guess for the sample type based on context, the statement doesn't explicitly state it. A more conservative interpretation without making assumptions beyond the provided text could suggest "Sampletype" as "NA" if the information is not definitive.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This version is more aligned with the information directly provided in the statement.
