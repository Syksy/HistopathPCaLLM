To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive tumor tissue" and describes it as "malignant focus," so the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason grading of "4+3". Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it is a standard calculation (4+3=7), so the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
