To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive tumor tissue" and describes it as "malignant focus." Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grading is given as "4+3". Although the sum is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied and can be calculated as 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information extracted from the histopathological statement.
