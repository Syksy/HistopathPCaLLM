To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. In the context of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"), "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is the same as prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive tumor tissue" and describes it as "malignant focus". This confirms that there were malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides a Gleason grading of "4+3". Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it is a common convention to calculate the sum (4+3=7). Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
