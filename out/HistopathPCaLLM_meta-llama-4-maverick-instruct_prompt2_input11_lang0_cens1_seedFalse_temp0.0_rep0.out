To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section" and mentions that "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated," which suggests a sample that could be from a larger prostate specimen or a biopsy. The term "prostate tissue" is broad and could apply to various sample types. However, the lack of specific mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) and the context of examining a portion of the material suggests it could be a "biopsy." Since it's not explicitly stated and could be interpreted in different ways, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the mention of limited material being investigated, but it's not conclusive. For the sake of this task and given the ambiguity, we'll consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions that fractions of the most usual Gleason scores (score 4 and score 3) "could not be reliably assessed." The mention of Gleason scores implies that there is a suspicion or presence of malignancy since Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. However, the statement does not directly confirm malignancy; it implies an investigation that is suggestive of a potential malignancy but does not conclusively state the presence of malignant tumor findings. The presence of "varying differentiation stages" could imply malignancy, as it often refers to cancerous cells. However, the statement is not definitive. For structuring, since it implies a potential malignancy but doesn't directly state it, and given the context that Gleason scores are mentioned (which are used for cancer grading), one might interpret it as suggestive of malignancy. Yet, the explicit confirmation is lacking, so a cautious approach would be to consider it as "NA" due to the ambiguity.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed." This indicates that while there is an implication of Gleason scores being relevant (suggesting malignancy), the actual Gleason grade could not be determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not reliably assessed.

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not provide clear, direct information on the sample type, does not conclusively state the presence of malignancy, and does not provide a reliable Gleason grade.
