To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which could imply a more substantial sample like RP (Radical Prostatectomy). Yet, the mention of "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated" suggests it might not be a full RP or it is referring to the portion that was analyzed. The text doesn't explicitly state the sample type, but given the context, it seems more aligned with a biopsy due to the percentage of material investigated. However, without a clear indication, this is somewhat speculative.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages," which could imply malignancy since it mentions varying differentiation stages, a characteristic often associated with cancer. However, it does not directly state the presence of malignancy. The presence of "Gleason scores" (score 4 and score 3) is mentioned, which is a grading system used for prostate cancer, indicating malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that these "could not be reliably assessed." This implies that while there is an indication of what the Gleason scores might be, they are not definitively stated due to the limitations in the material available for investigation.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: Since it's not explicitly stated and the context is somewhat ambiguous, we might lean towards "biopsy" due to the percentage of material analyzed, but it's not a clear indication. Thus, it could be considered as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The mention of Gleason scores indicates malignancy, so "yes".
- **Gleason Grade**: Although Gleason scores 4 and 3 are mentioned, it's stated that they "could not be reliably assessed." Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" because the information is not reliable or definitive.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (and noting that the statement doesn't clearly differentiate between multiple lesions or specify the severity), is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structuring reflects the ambiguity and limitations present in the original statement regarding sample type and Gleason grade, while affirming the presence of malignancy based on the context provided.
