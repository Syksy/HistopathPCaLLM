To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step and extract the required information.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it discusses inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which could imply a more substantial sample than a typical biopsy. Yet, without explicit mention, we must be cautious. The term "prostate tissue" is broad and could relate to any of the sample types. However, the detailed inspection of various prostate sections might lean more towards a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a biopsy. The lack of specific indicators like "chips" for TURP or explicit mention of a "biopsy" or "RP" makes this challenging. Given the information, we can't conclusively determine the sample type based on the description alone, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of direct evidence.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions that fractions of the most usual Gleason scores (score 4 and score 3) "could not be reliably assessed." The mention of Gleason scores implies that there is a suspicion or presence of malignancy since Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. However, the statement does not directly confirm malignancy; it only hints at it by discussing Gleason scores. Still, the context suggests that the tissue is being evaluated for or has cancerous changes, as Gleason scores are relevant in the context of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Thus, we can infer "yes" for malignancy due to the discussion around Gleason scores, even though it's not a direct statement.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but notes that these "could not be reliably assessed" due to the limited material investigated. Despite this, it implies that if assessed, the Gleason score would be "4+3" (since it mentions score 4 and score 3). However, because it states that the fractions could not be reliably assessed, and given the instruction to follow the format strictly and the ambiguity around the Gleason score, one might argue for "NA". Yet, based on the information given and typical practices, one could infer a potential Gleason score. Still, adhering strictly to the given instructions and the fact that it "could not be reliably assessed," the most appropriate response would be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the cautious interpretation of the provided statement, leaning on the explicit and implicit information given.
