To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it talks about inspecting "all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section," which could imply a more substantial sample like RP (Radical Prostatectomy). Yet, the text does not explicitly state it, and the mention of "approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated" might suggest a biopsy. Without a clear indication, we must be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" conclusively, so we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes prostate tissue forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages" and mentions Gleason scores (4 and 3), which are terms typically used in the context of prostate cancer. However, it does not directly state the presence of malignancy; instead, it implies an examination that could be related to cancer (due to the mention of Gleason scores). Yet, it concludes that the fractions of the most usual Gleason scores "could not be reliably assessed," which complicates the determination. The presence of Gleason scores implies a malignant context, but the statement is not conclusive. Still, the context suggests a suspicion or investigation of malignancy, so one might argue towards "yes" due to the Gleason score mention, but it's not a direct statement of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores 4 and 3 but indicates that these "could not be reliably assessed." This implies that while there's an implication of a Gleason score ( potentially 4+3), it's not definitively stated due to the inability to assess it reliably. Thus, providing a Gleason grade as "4+3=7" might not be accurate due to the uncertainty. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to consider it as "NA" because the assessment was not reliable.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, so "NA" seems appropriate.
- **Malignancy**: Despite the context suggesting a potential malignancy investigation (due to the mention of Gleason scores), the statement doesn't directly confirm malignancy. However, the implication is there, so one might argue for "yes," but with caution.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the Gleason score assessment was not reliable, "NA" is the most appropriate choice.

Therefore, a structured JSON response, taking into account the nuances and the instructions to follow the format strictly and focusing on the most severe lesion (though not directly applicable here due to lack of multiple lesion information), could be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the cautious interpretation that while malignancy is implied (due to the context of Gleason scores), the sample type and Gleason grade are not clearly or reliably stated.
