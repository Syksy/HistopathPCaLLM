To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue with an electrocautery device.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that the material is classified as "benign", meaning there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
