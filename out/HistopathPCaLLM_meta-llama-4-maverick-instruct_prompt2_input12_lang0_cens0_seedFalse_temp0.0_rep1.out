To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves shavings or chips from the prostate. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." Thus, there were no malignant tumor findings, meaning "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no malignant tumor to grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and "Gleason" should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
