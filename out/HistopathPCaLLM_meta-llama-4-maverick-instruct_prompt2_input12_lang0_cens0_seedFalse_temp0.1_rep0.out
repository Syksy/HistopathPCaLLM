To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate." This terminology is associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), which is a surgical procedure where shavings or chips of prostate tissue are removed.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates that "the material is classified as benign." Therefore, there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade to report.

Based on the above analysis:

- The sample type is "TURP" because it involves "electrosection shavings from the prostate."
- Malignancy is "no" since the material is classified as benign.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample is benign.

Therefore, the structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
