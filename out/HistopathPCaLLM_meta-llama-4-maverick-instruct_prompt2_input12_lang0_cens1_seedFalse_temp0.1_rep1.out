Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required JSON format.

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. However, it does not explicitly mention the sample type or the Gleason grade.

Upon closer examination, the statement does not provide clear information about the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). It only mentions that the sample has been "started in eight batches", which is not sufficient to determine the sample type.

Therefore, based on the available information, I will structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. Sampletype: "NA" because the statement does not provide clear information about the sample type.
2. Malignancy: "yes" because the statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings.
3. Gleason: "NA" because the statement does not mention the Gleason grade.
