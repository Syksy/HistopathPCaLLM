Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data in JSON format.

The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. However, it does not provide information on the sample type or Gleason grade.

Here's my interpretation:

* Sample type: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). Therefore, I will mark it as "NA".
* Malignancy: The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will mark it as "yes".
* Gleason grade: The statement does not provide information on the Gleason grade. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
