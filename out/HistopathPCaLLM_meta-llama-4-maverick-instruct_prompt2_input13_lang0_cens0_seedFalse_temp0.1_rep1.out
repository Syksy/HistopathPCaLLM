To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which corresponds to the sample type "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: It is stated that "In sample B carcinoma is observed," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason score as "9 (4+5)," indicating the Gleason grade is "4+5=9."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion mentioned and providing the information in a non-nested structure.
