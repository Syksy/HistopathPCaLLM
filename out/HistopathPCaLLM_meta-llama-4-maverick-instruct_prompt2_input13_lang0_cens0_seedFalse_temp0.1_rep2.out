To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies," which indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: It is stated that "In sample B carcinoma is observed," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason score as "9 (4+5)," indicating the major Gleason grade is 4, the minor is 5, and the sum is 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be structured as "4+5=9."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the most severe lesion mentioned in the histopathological statement.
