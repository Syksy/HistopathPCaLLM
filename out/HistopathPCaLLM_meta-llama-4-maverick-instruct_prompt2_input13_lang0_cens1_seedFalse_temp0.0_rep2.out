To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, we'll have to default to "NA" as it's not explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague" and that "This suspicious pattern includes enough material for inspection and assessment." However, it does not confirm malignancy but rather suggests a need for "further verification is needed via consultation." Since there's no definitive statement on malignancy, we cannot conclusively say "yes." The statement does not rule out malignancy either, but given the uncertainty, the most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grades or mention anything related to Gleason scoring. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no information provided about the Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
