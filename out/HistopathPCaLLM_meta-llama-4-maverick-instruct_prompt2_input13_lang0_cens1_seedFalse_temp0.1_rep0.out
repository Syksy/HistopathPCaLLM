To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). There is no clear indication of the sample type being any of the specified types. Hence, we will categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "In sample B some irregularities are observed" and that these "warrant further inspection by a colleague" due to "differentiation patterns." However, it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings; instead, it mentions that "further verification is needed via consultation." Since there's no definitive statement about malignancy, and the tone suggests uncertainty or suspicion rather than confirmation, we will categorize this as "NA" because it doesn't clearly state "yes" or "no" to malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade information. It mentions "differentiation patterns" that are suspicious and warrant further inspection, but it does not specify a Gleason score. Therefore, we will categorize the Gleason grade as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
