To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Since there's no clear indication of the sample type, we'll have to default to "NA" as it's not explicitly mentioned as biopsy, RP, or TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague" and that "further verification is needed via consultation." This suggests that there are suspicious findings but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. However, the presence of "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" could imply a potential for malignancy, but it's not confirmed. The statement does not directly confirm malignant tumor findings. Therefore, we should consider it as not having a clear "yes" for malignancy. Since it's not a clear "yes" or "no" due to the need for further verification, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grades or mention anything related to Gleason scoring. It indicates that further inspection is needed, suggesting that a definitive Gleason score hasn't been determined. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the statement does not provide enough information to determine the sample type, confirm malignancy, or report a Gleason grade.
