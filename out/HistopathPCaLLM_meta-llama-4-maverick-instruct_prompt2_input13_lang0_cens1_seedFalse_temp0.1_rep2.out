To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). There is no clear indication of the sample type being any of the specified types. Hence, we will categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some irregularities are observed" and "suspicious pattern" which indicates a potential for malignancy but concludes with "further verification is needed via consultation." It does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Since it doesn't explicitly state the presence or absence of malignancy, we'll have to consider it as not clearly malignant or benign. Hence, we'll categorize "Malignancy" as "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grades or scores. It mentions "differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection" but does not specify a Gleason grade. Therefore, "Gleason" will be categorized as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
