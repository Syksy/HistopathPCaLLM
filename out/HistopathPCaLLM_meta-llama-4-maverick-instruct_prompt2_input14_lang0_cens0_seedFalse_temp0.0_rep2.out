To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." The term "prostatetectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is commonly known as Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some tumorous growth is observed," which implies the presence of a malignant tumor. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because the larger portion is score 3 and it sums up to 7. The minor component must be score 4 since 7 - 3 = 4.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
