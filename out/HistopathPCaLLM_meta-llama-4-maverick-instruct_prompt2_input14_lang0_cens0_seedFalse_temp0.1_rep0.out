To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." Prostatetectomy is commonly referred to as Radical Prostatectomy (RP) in medical terminology. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some tumorous growth is observed," which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: It is mentioned that "The found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because the larger portion is score 3 and it sums up to 7. 

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
