To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." Prostatetectomy is commonly associated with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some tumorous growth is observed," which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" and further details that the larger portion of the score is 3, approximately 60% in the findings. It implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 because it mentions "Gleason 7-stage" and a larger portion being score 3. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be inferred as "3+4=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information extracted from the histopathological statement.
