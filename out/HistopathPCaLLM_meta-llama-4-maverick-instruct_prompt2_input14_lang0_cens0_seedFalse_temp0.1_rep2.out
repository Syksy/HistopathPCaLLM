To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate." The term "prostatetectomy" refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which is commonly known as Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some tumorous growth is observed peripherally," which implies the presence of a malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings." This implies that the Gleason score is 3 (major) + 4 (minor) = 7, as the larger portion being score 3 suggests that it is the primary or major grade, and the remaining portion is likely score 4 to make the total score 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
