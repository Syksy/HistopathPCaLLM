To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the patient's prostate tissue, prepared to be run on casettes following the normal routine" and discusses various samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q), indicating it is a tissue sample. However, it doesn't directly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The context suggests it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of sampling and not explicitly indicating a prostatectomy or TURP. However, the exact sample type isn't clearly stated, and the process described doesn't directly correlate with the typical definitions of biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and the possibility of "mid-grade GG findings" but does not directly confirm malignancy. It suggests further investigation is needed to assess the findings and their implications. The language used is cautious and doesn't directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" because it doesn't clearly state "yes" or "no" to malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement references a "Gleason 7 score patient" in the context of a different patient, not the one being discussed. For the patient in question, it doesn't provide a Gleason score but mentions the need for further histopathological investigation to possibly rule out "mid-grade GG findings." Since it doesn't directly report a Gleason grade for the patient in question, we should consider it as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not clearly indicate the sample type, does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy, and does not report a Gleason grade for the patient being discussed.
