Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue" and "sample material drawn from roughly the prostate capsule border region", which suggests that it is a biopsy or a surgical specimen. However, it does not clearly indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" for Sampletype.

The statement mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and suggests that further histopathological investigation is warranted to rule out "mid-grade GG findings", but it does not explicitly state that the tumor is malignant. However, the tone of the statement implies that there is some suspicion of malignancy, but it is not conclusive. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" for Malignancy.

The statement mentions a "recent Gleason 7 score patient" as a comparison, but it does not report a Gleason grade for the current patient. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" for Gleason.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
