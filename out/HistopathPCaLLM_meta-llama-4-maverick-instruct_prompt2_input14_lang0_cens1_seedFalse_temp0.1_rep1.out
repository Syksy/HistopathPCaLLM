Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement. Although it is mentioned that the specimen consists of prostate tissue and samples were run on cassettes, the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not clear. Therefore, the sample type will be marked as "NA".

2. The statement does not explicitly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further histopathological investigation to rule out mid-grade GG findings, but it does not directly state that the tumor is malignant. Therefore, the malignancy will be marked as "NA" due to the lack of a definitive statement.

3. The reported Gleason grade is not directly stated for the patient in question. A comparison is made to a different patient with a Gleason 7 score, but this is not relevant to the current patient's Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade will be marked as "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
