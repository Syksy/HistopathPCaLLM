Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned in the statement. Although it is mentioned that the specimen consists of prostate tissue and samples were run on cassettes, the specific type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not clear. Therefore, the sample type will be considered as "NA".

2. The statement does not explicitly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and the need for further histopathological investigation, but it does not directly state that the findings are malignant. Therefore, the malignancy status will be considered as "NA".

3. The reported Gleason grade is not directly mentioned as a finding for the current patient. However, it is mentioned that a colleague compared this patient to a different patient with a Gleason 7 score. This is not a report of the current patient's Gleason score, so the Gleason grade will be considered as "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
