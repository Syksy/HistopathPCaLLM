To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample type because it refers to the material being "chippings" or shavings from the prostate. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material. This indicates that there were malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grade information, mentioning that "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Although it doesn't explicitly state the minor grade, it implies a sum score. For TURP samples, typically, only the most prevalent Gleason pattern and the highest are considered, and sometimes the score is directly given. Here, it directly mentions a sum of 8 without the explicit major and minor. However, given that Gleason 4 is the most represented, we can infer that the score could be something like 4+4=8. Since the exact major and minor are not both explicitly stated but it is a malignant statement with a Gleason sum provided, we will directly use the information available.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON structure adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement. Note that we inferred "4+4=8" for the Gleason score as the statement directly mentions a sum of 8 and Gleason 4 being most represented, which is a reasonable assumption for a TURP sample where Gleason scores are often reported as a sum or with the predominant pattern.
