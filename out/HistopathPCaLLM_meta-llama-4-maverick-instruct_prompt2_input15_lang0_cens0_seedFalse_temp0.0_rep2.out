To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as this procedure involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grade information, mentioning that "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and leading to a "sum of 8". Although it doesn't directly state the minor Gleason grade, it implies a sum that could be derived from a major and minor grade. A common interpretation for a sum of 8, with 4 being the major, could suggest a Gleason score like 4+4=8 or another combination. However, given that it mentions Gleason 4 as the most represented and a sum of 8, a plausible Gleason score is 4+4=8.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This interpretation assumes that the Gleason score is 4+4=8 based on the information provided and the common representation of Gleason scores. If the exact minor grade were known (e.g., 3 or 5), it would be more accurately represented. However, with the given information, 4+4=8 is a reasonable interpretation for a sum of 8 with 4 being the most represented grade.
