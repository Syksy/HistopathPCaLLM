To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as this procedure involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Typically, the Gleason score is reported as the sum of the two most prevalent Gleason patterns. The statement implies a primary pattern of 4 and suggests a secondary pattern that together sum to 8. A common interpretation could be that the Gleason score is 4+4=8, as it mentions Gleason 4 being the most represented. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be structured as "4+4=8".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information extracted from the histopathological statement.
