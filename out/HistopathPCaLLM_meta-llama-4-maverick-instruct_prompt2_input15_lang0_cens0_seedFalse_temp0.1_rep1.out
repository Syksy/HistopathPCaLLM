To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as this procedure involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grade information, mentioning that "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and leading to a "sum of 8". Although it doesn't directly state the minor grade, it implies a sum that could be derived from a major and minor grade. Given that the sum is 8 and Gleason 4 is the most represented (implying it's likely the major grade), we can infer a possible Gleason score like 4+4=8. However, the statement doesn't explicitly provide both the major and minor grades. For the sake of structuring according to the given instructions and assuming the most severe lesion is being described, we'll directly use the information that implies a Gleason sum of 8. Since it mentions Gleason 4 as the most represented and doesn't directly give a minor grade but implies a sum of 8, a reasonable interpretation could be "4+4=8".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This structured data adheres to the required format and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
