To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as this procedure involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement confirms the presence of "adenocarcinoma" throughout the sample material, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason grade, mentioning that "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8." Although it doesn't explicitly state the minor grade, it implies a sum score. For TURP samples, typically, a Gleason score is given without detailing the primary and secondary patterns if the tumor is homogeneous or if the sample is not a biopsy. However, the statement implies a Gleason score of 8, and given that Gleason 4 is the most represented, we can infer a possible score like 4+4=8. Yet, to adhere strictly to the given information and the required format, we will directly use the information that leads to a sum of 8, assuming it could be represented as "4+4=8".

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement implies a Gleason score sum of 8 and mentions Gleason 4 as the most represented, we'll consider "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
