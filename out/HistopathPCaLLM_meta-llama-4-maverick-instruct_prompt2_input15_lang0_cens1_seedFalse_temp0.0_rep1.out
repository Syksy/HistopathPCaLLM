To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate tissue material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It implies that some form of tissue was taken but doesn't specify the procedure. Therefore, the sample type is not directly mentioned, so it should be considered as "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignancy through histopathology. It indicates that the suspicion needs to be confirmed or discarded in the next histologic examination. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy from the histopathological examination, and the statement does not directly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings from the sample examined, the malignancy status should be considered "NA" because it was not determined.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade were not determinable or not available from the given histopathological statement.
