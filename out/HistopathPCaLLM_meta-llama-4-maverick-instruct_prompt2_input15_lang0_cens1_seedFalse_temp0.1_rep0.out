Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data in valid JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "Prostate tissue material" being processed, which could be related to a biopsy. However, the exact sample type is not clear. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

The statement mentions "suspected presence of an adenocaricoma" in the clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. In fact, it states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that "Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session". This implies that the current examination did not confirm malignancy. Therefore, I will mark "Malignancy" as "NA" due to the lack of conclusive information.

The statement does not provide a reported Gleason grade. Although it mentions a "Gleason sum of 8 or above" in the clinical notes, this is not a confirmed finding. Therefore, I will mark "Gleason" as "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
