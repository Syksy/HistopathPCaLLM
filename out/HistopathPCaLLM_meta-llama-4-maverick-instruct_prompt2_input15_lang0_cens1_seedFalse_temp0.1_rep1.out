To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate tissue material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It implies that some form of tissue was taken but doesn't specify the procedure. Therefore, we should categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement refers to "suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma" based on clinical notes, but it also mentions that this suspicion "was not based on any histopathology." It further states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time," implying that malignancy was not confirmed through histopathology. Thus, we should consider it as "NA" because the malignancy was not confirmed.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time." It references a suspected Gleason sum based on clinical notes but not on histopathological examination. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the given statement does not provide sufficient or clear information to determine the sample type, confirm malignancy, or report a Gleason grade.
