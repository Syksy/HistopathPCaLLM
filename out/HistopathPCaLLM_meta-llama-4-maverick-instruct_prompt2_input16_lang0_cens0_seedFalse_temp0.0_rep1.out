To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "carcinoma focuses" and describes characteristics of the carcinoma, such as Gleason grades. This confirms that there were malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grade 3 and 4 carcinoma. It mentions that the "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7.

Given the information, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
