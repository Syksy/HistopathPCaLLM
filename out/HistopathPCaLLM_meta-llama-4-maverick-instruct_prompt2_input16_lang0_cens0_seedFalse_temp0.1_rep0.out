To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "carcinoma focuses" and describes characteristics of the carcinoma, such as Gleason grades. Thus, there are malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grade 3 and 4 carcinoma. It mentions that the "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 3 (major) + 4 (minor) = 7 because the primary or major component is grade 3 (covering 2/3) and the secondary or minor component is grade 4 (covering 1/3). Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
