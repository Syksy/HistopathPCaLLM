To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "carcinoma focuses" and describes characteristics of the carcinoma, such as Gleason grades. Thus, there are malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grade 3 and 4, with grade 3 covering approximately 2/3 and grade 4 covering approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma. It concludes with a score of 7. The Gleason score is derived from the major and minor grades, which are 3 and 4, respectively, summing up to 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7."

Given the information and the instructions, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information extracted from the histopathological statement.
