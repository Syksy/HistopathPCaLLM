To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. However, it refers to "the total sample material" and "digitalized images" and "slides prior to digitalization," which suggests it is a biopsy. There's no clear mention of it being "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." Therefore, "Sampletype" = "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement refers to "suspicious foci" and various "grades of cell differentiation," which implies the presence of malignant cells or at least a suspicion thereof. It discusses the difficulty in assigning explicit scores due to resolution issues but does not conclude the sample is benign. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, "Malignancy" = "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. It hints at the possibility of mid-grade differentiation (e.g., 3+4 or 4+3) but does not provide a definitive Gleason grade. Since a specific Gleason grade cannot be determined from the information given, and given that the sample is suspected to be malignant, the Gleason grade should be considered as not available or "NA." Therefore, "Gleason" = "NA."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
