To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it discusses inspecting "multiple suspicious foci" and issues related to digital histopathology and manual grading on slides, it suggests a biopsy. Yet, it's not explicitly stated, and other types like TURP could also potentially involve multiple foci. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as it doesn't mention features typical for RP specimens like extraprostatic extension or margin status directly. However, without a clear indication, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type, so we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement refers to "suspicious foci" and discusses issues with grading due to digitalization problems, implying that there's a suspicion or indication of malignancy. It mentions observing "various grades of cell differentiation," which suggests that there are malignant cells present since Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer (a malignant condition). Thus, it implies "yes" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. It hints at the possibility of mid-grade differentiation (like 3+4 or 4+3) but doesn't provide a definitive Gleason score. Since a specific Gleason score isn't given and the statement indicates that grading couldn't be conclusively done, we should consider it as "NA" for the structured data.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects that while malignancy is indicated, the sample type and Gleason grade are not conclusively determinable from the statement provided.
