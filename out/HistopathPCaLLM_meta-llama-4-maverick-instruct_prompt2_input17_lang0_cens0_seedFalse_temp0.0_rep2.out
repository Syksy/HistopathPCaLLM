To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3," which implies the presence of malignant tumor findings since Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer. Thus, malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is 4+3. Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it is conventional to calculate the sum as 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "4+3=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
