To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and mentions "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." This implies the Gleason score is "4+3". To determine the sum, we add the two numbers: 4 + 3 = 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3=7".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the information from the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
