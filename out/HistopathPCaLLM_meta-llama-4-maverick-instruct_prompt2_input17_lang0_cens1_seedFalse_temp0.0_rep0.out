Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D" and "E-F" and "G-N", which suggests that it is a pathology report. However, it does not clearly indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP, TURP, or other type of sample. Therefore, the sample type is uncertain.

The statement mentions that the assessment will determine if the material is "fully healthy" or if "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present". This implies that the presence of malignancy is uncertain at this point, and the report is preliminary.

There is no clear mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement.

Given the uncertainty and lack of clear information, I will structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not provide a clear indication of the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The report appears to be preliminary and awaiting further assessment.
