Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is that the statement does not provide any clear information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The text mentions that the samples are from the prostate and that Gleason grades between 3 to 5 are considered, but it does not provide a specific diagnosis or Gleason score. The statement also mentions that the material may be "fully healthy", implying that there may not be any malignant findings. However, without a clear statement about the presence or absence of malignancy, the most appropriate answer is "NA" for all fields.
