Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D" and "E-F" and "G-N", which suggests that it is a pathology report. However, it does not clearly indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP, TURP, or other type of sample. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Sampletype.

The statement mentions that the material "likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy", which implies that the presence of malignancy is not confirmed. It also mentions that the assessment will be held out as an assignment to specializing resident candidates, suggesting that the diagnosis is not yet concluded. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Malignancy.

The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade, as it is not a conclusive diagnosis. It only mentions that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 "are at all present or if the material is fully healthy", which is not a definitive Gleason score. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Gleason.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
