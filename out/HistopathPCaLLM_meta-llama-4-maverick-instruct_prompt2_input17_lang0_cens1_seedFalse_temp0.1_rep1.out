Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is that the statement does not provide any clear information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The text mentions that the samples are from the prostate and that Gleason differentiation stages between 3 to 5 are possible, but it does not provide a specific diagnosis or Gleason grade. Additionally, the text indicates that the assessment is pending and will be updated later. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is to mark all fields as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.
