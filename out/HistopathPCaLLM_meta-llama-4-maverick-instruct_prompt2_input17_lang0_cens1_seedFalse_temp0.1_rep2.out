Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D" and "E-F" and "G-N", which suggests that it is a pathology report. However, it does not clearly indicate whether it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Sampletype.

The statement mentions that the assessment will determine if the material is "fully healthy" or if "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present". This implies that the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, and the report is still pending. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Malignancy.

The statement mentions Gleason grades, but it does not provide a specific Gleason score. It only mentions that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present, which is not a conclusive Gleason score. Therefore, I will mark it as "NA" for Gleason.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
