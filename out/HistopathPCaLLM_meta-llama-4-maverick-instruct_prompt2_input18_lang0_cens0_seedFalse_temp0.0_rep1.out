To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is affirmative.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason sum is mentioned as 7, with further details that the larger fraction has a Gleason grade of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies the Gleason score is composed of grades 3 and 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7, and grade 3 is the larger fraction). Therefore, the Gleason score can be inferred as "3+4=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information derived from the histopathological statement.
