To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" and that they are processed through multiple tissue blocks. The term "chippings" is often associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in small chips. Therefore, the sample type is likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of carcinoma, stating "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma." Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason sum, stating it is "7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Since it mentions "the larger fraction with stage 3," it suggests that the primary grade is 3, making the Gleason score likely "3+4=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
