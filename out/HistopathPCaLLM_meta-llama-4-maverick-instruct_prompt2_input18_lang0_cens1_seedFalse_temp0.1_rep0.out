To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures" and specifies that it is processed in "12 tissue batches." While it doesn't directly state the type of sample, the context implies it's related to prostate procedures. Common prostate-related procedures include biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), and TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement doesn't explicitly mention the type, but given that it's processed in "12 tissue batches," it is more likely to be a biopsy, as biopsies are often processed in multiple batches or cores. However, without a clear indication, one might lean towards "biopsy" due to the mention of "tissue batches," which is common in biopsy reports.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "a small fraction would require further inspection (less than 5%)" because it "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above." This implies that there is suspicion of malignancy but it's not confirmed. However, the presence of a suspicious area that "might contain" malignant cells suggests that malignancy is not definitively identified but is considered possible. The majority (>95%) appears benign. Given that there's no definitive statement of malignancy but a suspicion, the most accurate answer based on the given choices would be "yes" because there's an implication of potential malignancy (ISUP GG 1 or above suggests a Gleason Grade that is associated with malignancy).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the suspicious focus "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above" but notes that it's "too small to properly assign a grade group." ISUP GG 1 corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+3=6. However, since the Gleason grade is not definitively assigned due to the small size of the suspicious area, and given the instruction to follow the format strictly which implies providing a definitive Gleason score or "NA," the appropriate response would be "NA" because a definitive Gleason score isn't provided.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the interpretation that the sample is likely from a biopsy due to the processing in "12 tissue batches," there's a suspicion of malignancy hence "yes" for malignancy, and "NA" for Gleason grade because it's not definitively assigned.
