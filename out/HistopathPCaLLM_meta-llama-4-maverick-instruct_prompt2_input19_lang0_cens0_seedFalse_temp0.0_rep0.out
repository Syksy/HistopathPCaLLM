To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, which is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "sample 4... contains adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4 as "Gleason 3" (approximately 90%) and "Gleason 4" (10%). The Gleason score is calculated as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it seems the major grade is 3 (since it's the larger portion) and the minor is 4. Thus, the Gleason score is "3+4=7."

Since the task is to report the results from the most severe lesion and sample 4 is the one containing adenocarcinoma (the malignant finding), we will base our structured data on this sample.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
