To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "sample 4... contains adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Thus, the presence of malignancy is affirmative.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4. It mentions "Gleason 3" for the larger portion and "Gleason 4" for the smaller part. The percentages are also given (90% for Gleason 3 and 10% for Gleason 4), but the statement directly implies the Gleason score by mentioning the grades. The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it seems Gleason 3 is the major grade, and Gleason 4 is the minor, so the score would be "3+4=7".

Given these observations:

- The sample type is "biopsy" because it mentions "targeted prostate biopsies."
- Malignancy is "yes" because adenocarcinoma is detected.
- The Gleason grade is "3+4=7" based on the information provided about the Gleason grades.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
