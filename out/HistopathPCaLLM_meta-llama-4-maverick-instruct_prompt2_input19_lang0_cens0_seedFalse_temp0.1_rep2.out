To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "sample 4... contains adenocarcinoma," which is a malignant tumor. Thus, the presence of malignancy is affirmative.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4. It mentions "Gleason 3" for the larger portion (approximately 90%) and "Gleason 4" for the smaller part (10%). The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it seems Gleason 3 is the major grade (since it's the larger portion), and Gleason 4 is the minor grade, making the Gleason score "3+4=7".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object reflects the information extracted from the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 4 in this case), and adheres to the required format and allowed values.
