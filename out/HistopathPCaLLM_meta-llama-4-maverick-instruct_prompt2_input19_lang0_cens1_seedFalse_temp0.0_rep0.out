To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly specify the type. However, it refers to samples being divided into batches and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which could imply a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated and could be interpreted in different ways, we'll have to consider it as not clearly defined. Thus, the sample type is not directly stated but based on the context, it seems to be a biopsy. However, given the ambiguity, the most cautious interpretation would be "NA" if we strictly follow the given instructions and examples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is mentioned that the cell architectures "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and it is "possibly malignant." However, it is also stated that it is "uncertain whether the tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)." The uncertainty and the fact that malignancy is not confirmed suggest that we should not conclusively mark it as malignant. The most severe lesion (sample 4) is of uncertain malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given allowed values would be "NA" due to the uncertainty and lack of a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of clear information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
