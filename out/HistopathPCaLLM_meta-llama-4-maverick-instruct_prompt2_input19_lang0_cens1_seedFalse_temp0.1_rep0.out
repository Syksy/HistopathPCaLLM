To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly specify the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples being divided into batches and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which suggests that the sample is likely a biopsy, as biopsies often involve examining tissue cores or cylinders. Despite this inference, the text does not explicitly state the sample type, and given the ambiguity, it might be more appropriate to categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" or if there's been a lab mishap. The uncertainty and the fact that it's "possibly malignant" do not confirm malignancy. Thus, since the most severe lesion (sample 4) is not definitively malignant and the statement does not conclusively state the presence of malignancy, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because it's uncertain.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade information. The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate tissue, and since sample 4's malignancy status is uncertain and not confirmed, and there's no explicit mention of a Gleason score, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
