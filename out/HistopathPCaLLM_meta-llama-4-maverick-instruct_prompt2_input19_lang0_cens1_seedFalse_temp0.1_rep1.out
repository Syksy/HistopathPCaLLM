To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples being divided into batches and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which suggests that the sample is likely a biopsy due to the reference to a "cylinder." Despite this hint, the sample type is not explicitly stated, and given the ambiguity, it might be best to consider it as not clearly identifiable from the information given.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" or if there's been a lab mishap. The uncertainty and the fact that it's "possibly malignant" suggest that malignancy is not confirmed. The most severe lesion (sample 4) is of uncertain malignancy, but since it's not definitively malignant, we should consider the malignancy status as not confirmed or "NA" because the statement does not definitively state "yes" to malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: There is no mention of Gleason grades in the statement. The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer. Since the statement does not confirm malignancy and does not provide Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement does not clearly specify the sample type, so it should be considered "NA" due to lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The most severe lesion is of uncertain malignancy, but since it's not confirmed as malignant, we should consider it "NA" or potentially "no" if we interpret "not confirmed as malignant" as benign or not malignant. However, "NA" is more appropriate due to the uncertainty.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason grade is mentioned, it should be "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
