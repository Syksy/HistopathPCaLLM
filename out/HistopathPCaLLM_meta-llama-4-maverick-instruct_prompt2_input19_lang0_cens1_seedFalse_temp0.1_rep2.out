To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type" but does not directly specify the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples being divided into batches and mentions "the whole cylinder's length," which suggests that the sample is likely a biopsy due to the reference to a "cylinder's length." Despite this hint, the sample type is not explicitly stated, and given the ambiguity, it might be best to consider it as not clearly identifiable to one of the allowed values.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that samples 2 and 3 are "healthy benign prostate tissue." For sample 4, it is uncertain whether the tissue is "truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)" due to potential mixing with non-prostate tissue. The uncertainty and the fact that it's "possibly malignant" do not confirm malignancy. Thus, we cannot conclusively say there are malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grades. The discussion around sample 4 suggests uncertainty about its malignancy but does not provide a Gleason score.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement does not clearly specify the sample type, so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm malignancy; hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the uncertainty and lack of a definitive diagnosis of malignancy.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmed malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, it should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
