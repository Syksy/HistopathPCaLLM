To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed." This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the growth observed is benign-like and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
