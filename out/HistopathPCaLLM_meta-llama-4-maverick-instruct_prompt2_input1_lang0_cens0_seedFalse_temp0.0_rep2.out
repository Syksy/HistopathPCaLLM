To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed," which means there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the growth observed is "benign-like" and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
