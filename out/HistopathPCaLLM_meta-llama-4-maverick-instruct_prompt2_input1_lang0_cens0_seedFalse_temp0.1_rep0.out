To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "12 representative needle biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, which is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "only benign-like growth is observed." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy should be marked as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the growth observed is "benign-like" and there's no mention of malignant cells or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" for benign statements.

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" because the statement refers to "needle biopsies."
- **Malignancy**: "no" because the conclusion is that only benign-like growth is observed.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the statement is about a benign condition and does not provide Gleason grades.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
