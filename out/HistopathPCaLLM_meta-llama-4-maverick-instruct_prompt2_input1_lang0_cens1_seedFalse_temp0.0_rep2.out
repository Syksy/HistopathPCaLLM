To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." The key term here is "samples," which could refer to various types of specimens. However, it specifically mentions "prostate cancer samples," which could be obtained through different methods like biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The statement does not directly specify the type of sample. Given the context, it is likely referring to a biopsy since it's inspecting "representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations," a common practice in biopsy procedures. However, the exact sample type isn't explicitly stated, so we should be cautious. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP or TURP and given the context of inspecting "representative prostate cancer samples," one might lean towards "biopsy." Yet, the statement's ambiguity and the lack of a clear indication towards any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP") suggest that we should consider it as "NA" due to the absence of a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples," which directly implies the presence of malignancy. However, it also states that "the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy." This indicates that while there's an expectation or indication of malignancy due to the presence of "prostate cancer samples," the confirmation is pending due to technical issues. Despite this ambiguity, the mention of "prostate cancer samples" is a strong indicator of malignancy being "yes." The uncertainty is about the conclusiveness of the findings rather than the presence of malignancy itself.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that the Gleason grade is not conclusively determined. Therefore, we cannot accurately state the Gleason grade as it is pending further inspection.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement does not clearly specify the sample type, so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: Despite the inconclusiveness, the presence of "prostate cancer samples" suggests malignancy is "yes".
- **Gleason Grade**: Since the Gleason findings are not conclusive, it should be considered as "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
