To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's inspecting "representative prostate cancer samples," it's likely referring to a biopsy, as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) and TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are specific procedures that might not be described in such general terms. However, without explicit mention, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "prostate cancer samples," which directly implies the presence of malignancy. However, it also states that the "final results appear inconclusive" regarding malignancy. Despite the presence of cancer samples, the inconclusive nature might suggest uncertainty. Still, the fact that it's discussing "prostate cancer samples" suggests that malignancy is known or suspected to be present. Thus, one might argue for "yes" due to the explicit mention of "prostate cancer samples."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the results are "highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding... potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." This implies that a conclusive Gleason grade was not provided or determined, likely due to the technical issues mentioned. Therefore, we should consider "NA" for the Gleason grade as it's not conclusively reported.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning is as follows:
- **Sampletype**: "NA" because the specific type of sample isn't clearly stated.
- **Malignancy**: "yes" because the statement refers to "prostate cancer samples," indicating known malignancy.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the Gleason grade is not conclusively reported due to technical artefacts and the need for additional inspection.
