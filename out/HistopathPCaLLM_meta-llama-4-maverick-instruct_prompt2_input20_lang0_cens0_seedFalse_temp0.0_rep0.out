To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatectomy is often abbreviated as "RP" in medical terminology, which stands for Radical Prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades for two different areas: "Gleason 3+4" for the apex and "4+4" for the basis. Since "4+4" represents a higher Gleason sum (8) compared to "3+4" (7), it is considered more severe. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+4=8".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
