To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection." Prostatectomy is often abbreviated as "RP" in medical terminology, which stands for Radical Prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma." Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer, so there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades for two different areas:
   - For the apex, it mentions "Gleason 3+4 staging".
   - For the basis, it mentions "class 4+4".

   Since the basis presents with a higher Gleason sum (4+4 = 8) compared to the apex (3+4 = 7), it is considered the more severe lesion. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by:
- Identifying the sample type as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- Confirming the presence of malignancy as "yes".
- Reporting the Gleason grade of the most severe lesion as "4+4=8".
