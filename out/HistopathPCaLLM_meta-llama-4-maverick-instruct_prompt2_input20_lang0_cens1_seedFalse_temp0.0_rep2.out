To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the obtained prostate tissue samples" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It implies that some form of sampling has occurred but is not clear about the method. Given the context, it seems to be referring to a biopsy, but the text does not directly confirm this. However, it does not rule out biopsy either. The statement's focus is more on the condition and the difficulty in assessing the samples rather than the sampling method. Since it's not explicitly mentioned and the context is somewhat ambiguous regarding the sample type, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of clear information.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement mentions "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This indicates that due to previous treatments, the assessment for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) cannot be made. It does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy but indicates that an assessment cannot be done. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Hence, it should be considered as "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement hypothetically mentions a "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clearly indicates that assessing Gleason grade is not possible due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not reported or confirmed, making it "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the inability to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade from the provided statement due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue samples and the lack of clear information about the sampling method.
