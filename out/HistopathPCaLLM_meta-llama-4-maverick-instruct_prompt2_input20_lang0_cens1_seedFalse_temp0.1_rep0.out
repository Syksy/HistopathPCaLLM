To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the obtained prostate tissue samples" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It implies that some form of sampling has occurred but is not clear about the method. Given the context and the fact that it doesn't clearly match "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and considering the information is not directly available, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected." This implies that due to previous treatments, the assessment of malignancy (adenocarcinoma specifically) cannot be made. Thus, it is not explicitly stated as "yes" or "no" due to the impact of therapies on cell morphology. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the malignancy status cannot be determined.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement hypothetically mentions "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clearly indicates that assessing Gleason grade is not feasible due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue. Therefore, since the Gleason grade cannot be determined and is not actually reported for the sample, the answer should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the inability to determine the required information from the given statement due to its content and the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue samples.
