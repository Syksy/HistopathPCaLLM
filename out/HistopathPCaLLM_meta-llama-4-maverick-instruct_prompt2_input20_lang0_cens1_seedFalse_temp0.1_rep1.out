To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the obtained prostate tissue samples" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It implies that some form of sampling has occurred but is not clear about the method. Given the context, it seems to be referring to a biopsy, but the statement is not definitive. However, it does not directly state "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region." This implies that there is a context where adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) is being considered or suspected, but the examination is hindered by previous therapies. However, it does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. The statement leans towards uncertainty regarding malignancy due to the impact of previous treatments on the tissue. Thus, we should categorize it as "NA" because we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement hypothetically mentions "lower level Gleason (such as 3+4)" but clearly indicates that assessing Gleason grade is not possible due to the effects of previous therapies on the prostate tissue. Therefore, we cannot confirm a Gleason grade, and it should be categorized as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the uncertainty and lack of clear information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the given histopathological statement.
