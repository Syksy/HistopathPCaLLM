Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the required information and structure it in valid JSON format.

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue samples" being obtained and divided into six main sets. However, it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is uncertain.

The statement mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, implying that there is uncertainty regarding the presence of malignant tumor findings.

The statement also mentions a hypothetical Gleason grade (3+4), but it is not a confirmed or reported value.

Given the uncertainty and lack of explicit information, I will structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not provide clear or definitive information regarding the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The information is either uncertain, hypothetical, or not explicitly stated.
