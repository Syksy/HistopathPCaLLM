To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves the removal of prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" and "tumor-like tissue" indicates malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy finding is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades, mentioning the most common as 5 and the second most common as 4. Therefore, the Gleason score can be represented as "5+4=9".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
