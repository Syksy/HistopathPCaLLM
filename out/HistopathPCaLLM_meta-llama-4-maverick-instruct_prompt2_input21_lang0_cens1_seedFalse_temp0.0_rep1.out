To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology." This indicates that the sample is from a prostate procedure, but it doesn't directly state the type. However, given the context and the fact that it mentions "fragments" and "up to 8mm a piece," it suggests a biopsy or possibly a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). The exact nature isn't clear, but "TURP" or "biopsy" could be considered. However, the description more closely aligns with a biopsy due to the mention of fragments and the context not strongly suggesting a TURP. Still, without a clear indication, one might lean towards "NA" due to the ambiguity.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carpet-like growth" which can be associated with malignant patterns, but it also states that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that "roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material." This indicates uncertainty or inability to conclusively determine malignancy due to poor sample quality. Thus, it leans towards "NA" because a definitive "yes" or "no" on malignancy isn't provided.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions issues with assessing cell differentiation patterns due to technical noise and poor material quality. Therefore, it should be considered "NA" as there's no Gleason score provided or assessable.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not clearly indicate the sample type, does not conclusively determine malignancy, and does not provide a Gleason grade. The information is either ambiguous or not assessable due to the quality of the sample.
