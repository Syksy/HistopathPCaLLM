To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece," which indicates that the sample is from a prostate procedure. It doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's "extracted prostate material" and mentions fragments being put to histology, it suggests a biopsy or possibly TURP. However, the exact nature (biopsy or TURP) isn't clear. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or clearly as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context, it might lean towards "biopsy" due to the mention of fragments being examined histologically. However, the description is not definitive, and the sample type isn't clearly stated.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carpet-like growth," which can be indicative of malignancy in certain contexts, but it also talks about technical issues ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns") and a significant portion of the material being "too noisy" for proper assessment. It doesn't directly confirm malignancy or benignancy due to these technical issues. Thus, a definitive assessment of malignancy isn't made.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't provide a Gleason grade due to the technical issues mentioned ("technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns").

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, so it should be considered as "NA" due to lack of clear information.
- **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't conclusively determine malignancy due to technical issues, so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Gleason Grade**: Not provided due to the inability to assess cell differentiation patterns, so it should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
