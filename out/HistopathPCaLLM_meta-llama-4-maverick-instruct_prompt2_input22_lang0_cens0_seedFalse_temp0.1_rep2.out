To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that the left side fragments exhibit "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures" and mentions "cancerous growth." This confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Although it mentions that the right side does not exhibit signs of malignancies, the presence of malignancy on the left side is enough to classify the overall sample as having malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason scores for the malignant tissue on the left side, mentioning "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." This implies the Gleason grade is "3+4=7." Since the left side is malignant and has a Gleason score, and it's considered the more severe lesion compared to the benign right side, "3+4=7" is the relevant Gleason grade.

Given the information and focusing on the most severe lesion (the left side in this case), the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
