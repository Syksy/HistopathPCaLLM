To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it discusses "tissue sampling material" and fragmentation, it is likely referring to a biopsy. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, or TURP) isn't clearly stated. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as RP or TURP and given the context, we might lean towards it being a biopsy. However, the statement's focus on the difficulty in assessing the material due to fragmentation and potential contamination issues doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Therefore, we should be cautious and consider if it's clearly identifiable.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult." It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates that despite some abnormal cell differentiation, the presence of malignancy cannot be confirmed due to the sample's condition.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult and implies that a Gleason score cannot be provided due to the complexity and potential issues with the sample.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The text implies it's likely a biopsy due to the mention of "tissue sampling material," but it's not definitive. Therefore, a cautious interpretation might be "biopsy" if we consider the context, but it's not a clear-cut identification.
- **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that malignancy cannot be assessed, so it leans towards "NA" because the presence or absence of malignancy is not confirmed.
- **Gleason Grade**: It's "NA" because the statement explicitly says that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult and implies it cannot be done.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, taking into account the nuances and the fact that the statement does not provide clear, definitive information for all fields, is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the available information and the understanding that the sample type is most likely a biopsy due to the context provided, but both malignancy and Gleason grade are "NA" due to the inability to assess these aspects from the given statement.
