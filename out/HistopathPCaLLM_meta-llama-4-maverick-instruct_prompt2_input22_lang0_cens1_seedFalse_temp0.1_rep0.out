To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's describing tissue sampling material with specific lengths from different sides, it suggests a biopsy. However, the description is not definitive for biopsy, RP, or TURP. The statement implies it's a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling material" and the detailed description of fragment lengths, which is common in biopsy reports.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult." It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates uncertainty regarding malignancy due to the sample's condition and quality, rather than a clear indication of benign or malignant status. Thus, it leans towards not being able to determine malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult and implies that a Gleason score cannot be provided due to the sample's condition. Therefore, a Gleason grade cannot be determined.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the context provided, although it's not a straightforward identification.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm malignancy; instead, it indicates that the assessment for malignancy cannot be made.
- **Gleason Grade**: It's "NA" because the statement indicates that assigning a Gleason grade is not possible.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the given statement and the rules provided.
