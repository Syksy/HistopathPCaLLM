To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's describing tissue sampling material with specific lengths from different sides, it suggests a biopsy. However, the description is not definitive for a specific sample type like biopsy, RP, or TURP. Still, "biopsy" seems the most plausible given the context of sampling material.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that assigning a Gleason score "proves to be exceptionally difficult." It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates uncertainty regarding malignancy due to the sample's condition, rather than a clear indication of malignancy or benignity.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason score is difficult and implies that it cannot be done due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for further verification of the sample's origin and integrity. Thus, a Gleason grade is not provided.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the description of tissue sampling. However, it's not a straightforward identification.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not conclusively determine malignancy; it indicates that assessment is not possible due to the sample's condition.
- **Gleason Grade**: Not provided due to the difficulties mentioned.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, taking into account the nuances and the fact that the statement does not provide a clear malignancy assessment or Gleason score, should reflect the uncertainty.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON reflects that while the sample is likely a biopsy, the malignancy and Gleason grade cannot be determined from the given statement.
