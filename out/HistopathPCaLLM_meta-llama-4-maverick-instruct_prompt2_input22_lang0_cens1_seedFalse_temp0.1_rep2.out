To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material" and describes fragmentation and sampling from both the left and right sides. It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that it's describing tissue sampling material with specific lengths from different sides, it suggests a biopsy. However, the description is not definitive for biopsy, RP, or TURP. The statement implies it's a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling material" and the detailed description of fragment lengths, which is common in biopsy reports.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentiation types" and that "Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult." It also states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed." This indicates uncertainty regarding malignancy due to the sample's condition and quality, rather than a clear indication of benignity or malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult and implies that a Gleason score cannot be provided due to the wide range of cell architectures and the need for reprocessing. Thus, a Gleason grade is not provided.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the context of "sampling material" and the description provided. However, it's not a definitive identification.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not conclusively determine malignancy; it indicates that the assessment cannot be made.
- **Gleason Grade**: Not provided due to the difficulties mentioned.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, taking into account the allowed values and the need to reflect the uncertainty or lack of information in the statement, is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the information given and the constraints of the allowed values. The sample type is inferred as "biopsy" based on the context, and both "Malignancy" and "Gleason" are marked as "NA" due to the lack of conclusive information in the statement.
