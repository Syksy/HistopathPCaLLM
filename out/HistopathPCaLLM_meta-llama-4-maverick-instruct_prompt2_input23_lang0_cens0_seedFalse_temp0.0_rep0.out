To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed for further investigation." Prostatectomy refers to the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) in the allowed values.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4 (60%)" as the most common, followed by "stage 5 (approx 30%)", and a tertiary grade of "class 3" with the least area. The conclusion directly states "Gleason-score sum 9", and it is implied that the major and minor grades are 5 and 4, respectively, because the most prevalent is grade 4 and the second most common is grade 5. Therefore, the Gleason score can be represented as "4+5=9". However, the statement directly mentions the sum as 9 and implies the grades are 4 and 5. To adhere strictly to the format and logic, we should directly use the information given or infer it correctly. The major grade is 4, and the minor is 5, so it should be "4+5=9".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
