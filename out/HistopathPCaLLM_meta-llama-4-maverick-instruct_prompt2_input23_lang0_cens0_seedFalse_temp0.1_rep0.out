To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentation stage 4" as the most common, "stage 5" as the second most common, and a tertiary grade of "class 3". The Gleason score sum is directly stated as "9", with the major and minor grades being implied by the percentages and the conclusion. The major grade is 4 and the minor is 5, summing to 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "4+5=9".

Given this analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
