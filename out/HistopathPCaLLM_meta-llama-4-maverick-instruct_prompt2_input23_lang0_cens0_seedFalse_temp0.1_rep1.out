To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for this is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", indicating the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades. It mentions "differentiation stage 4" as the most common, "stage 5" as the second most common, and a tertiary grade of "class 3". The Gleason score sum is directly stated as "9", with the major and minor grades being 5 and 4, respectively. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be represented as "5+4=9".

Given the information, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
