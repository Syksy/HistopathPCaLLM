To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate" which is another term for a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason scores, mentioning "differentiation stage 4", "stage 5" as the second most common, and a "tertiary grade" of 3. It concludes with a "Gleason-score sum 9". The primary and secondary grades are 4 and 5, respectively, making the Gleason score "4+5=9".

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion as required.
