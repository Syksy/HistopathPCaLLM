To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sample set" and "sample" but does not directly indicate the type. However, it refers to "ultrasound report and palpation" and a "prior incomplete report of sampled apex," suggesting a biopsy or possibly a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. Yet, the text does not explicitly state the sample type. Given the context, it seems more related to a biopsy or RP, but the exact type isn't clear. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and considering the context is somewhat ambiguous, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings," which implies malignancy is suspected or detected. However, the conclusion is to "validate the initial suspicions," indicating that while there's a suspicion of malignancy, it's not conclusively stated as detected in the provided sample set. The text implies that there was a prior suspicion or finding suggestive of malignancy. Thus, we can infer "Malignancy" as "yes" because Gleason grading is used for malignant tumors, and there's a mention of "Gleason 3 findings."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" but does not provide a complete Gleason score in the form of "major+minor=sum." It only mentions "Gleason 3," which is incomplete for our required format. Since we don't have a complete Gleason score and the statement is not conclusive about the final Gleason grading, and given that the sample is to be "reprocessed," we should be cautious. However, the presence of "Gleason 3" might imply a possible Gleason score, but without a clear "major+minor=sum" format, and considering the context that the statement is not conclusive, we should consider it as not having a definitive Gleason score reported.

Given these considerations:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" because the exact type isn't specified.
- **Malignancy**: "yes" due to the mention of "Gleason 3 findings," indicating suspected malignancy.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the Gleason score is not conclusively reported in the required "major+minor=sum" format.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
