To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sample set" and "sampled apex" but doesn't directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it implies a sample was taken, but the specific type isn't clearly mentioned. Given the context, it seems to be related to a biopsy or possibly a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample being re-examined. However, the exact type isn't specified, and the context doesn't directly point to a standard sample type. Therefore, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings," which implies that there were suspicions or indications of malignancy, but it doesn't confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings in the current sample. The presence of "Gleason 3 findings" is related to a previous, incomplete report. The current conclusion is to reprocess the sample to validate initial suspicions, not confirming malignancy directly from the given statement. Thus, we can't conclusively say "yes" or "no" based on the information given. The statement is more about a process and a suspicion rather than a confirmed diagnosis. Hence, we'll consider this as "NA" because the statement doesn't directly confirm malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" in a prior report, suggesting a possible Gleason score. However, it doesn't provide a complete Gleason score in the form of "major+minor=sum." The information is incomplete regarding the current sample's Gleason score. The focus is on reprocessing to validate suspicions, not on reporting a confirmed Gleason score. Therefore, we should consider this as "NA" because the statement doesn't directly report a confirmed Gleason score for the sample in question.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement doesn't directly provide clear, definitive information regarding the sample type, the presence of malignancy, or a confirmed Gleason score.
