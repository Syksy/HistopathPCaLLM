To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which signifies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it is implied that the Gleason score is 8, but the exact major and minor grades are not directly stated together in the conventional format. However, it is mentioned that the tumor is classified as "Gleason 4," and the sum is 8. Typically, for a sum of 8, the possible combinations are 4+4=8, 5+3=8, or 3+5=8. Given the mention of "Gleason 4," it's reasonable to infer that the Gleason score is likely 4+4=8.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP"
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason**: "4+4=8"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
