To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings," which indicates that the sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and concludes with "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma," which signifies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a "sum 8 adenocarcinoma." The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the major and minor grades. Here, it implies a Gleason score of "4+4=8" since it mentions a sum of 8 without explicitly stating the major and minor grades but referring to a Gleason 4 classification. For the purpose of this task, we will interpret it as "4+4=8" because the exact major and minor grades are not both explicitly stated, but it is reasonable to infer that it's likely "4+4" given that it's a Gleason 4-class tumor growth.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format, is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement.
