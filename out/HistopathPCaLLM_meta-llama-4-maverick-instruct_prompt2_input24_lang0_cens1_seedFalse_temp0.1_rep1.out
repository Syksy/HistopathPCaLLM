To tackle this task, let's analyze the given statement step by step:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings." The term "shavings" can be associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure that involves removing prostate tissue. "Radical prostatectomies" corresponds to "RP." Therefore, the sample types mentioned are "biopsy," "RP," and potentially "TURP" (implied by "shavings"). However, the statement does not specify a single sample type for a particular patient or lesion. Given the context, it seems the statement is more about a collection of samples used for teaching rather than a specific pathological diagnosis for a single patient. Therefore, determining a specific "Sampletype" for the most severe lesion is challenging without direct reference to a specific case. Hence, we might consider it as "NA" due to the lack of specificity to a single case or lesion.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement indicates that the material was initially "post-benign diagnosis," suggesting that the primary findings were not malignant. It mentions upgrading to Gleason scores indicative of malignancy in some cases upon re-evaluation. However, it does not directly state that the most severe lesion was malignant at the initial diagnosis. The presence of malignancy is implied in the context of upgrading some benign cases to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. Thus, while there are malignant findings in some cases, the statement's focus is not on a specific malignant lesion. Therefore, we could argue that "Malignancy" is "yes" because it discusses malignant grading (Gleason scores), but it's not directly answering the question for a specific lesion.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions Gleason scores, specifically "Gleason 3+3" or "3+4," indicating the presence of malignant grading. The most severe lesion mentioned is graded as "3+4." Therefore, the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion discussed is "3+4=7."

However, upon closer inspection, the task requires us to understand that the given text is not a straightforward histopathological report for a single patient but rather a description of a teaching material and exercise involving multiple patients. The text does not directly provide a clear, specific diagnosis for a single "most severe lesion." Therefore, applying the task's requirements directly is challenging.

Given the complexities and the fact that the statement doesn't directly pertain to a single patient's diagnosis, a reasonable interpretation leaning towards the task's constraints would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This interpretation acknowledges the presence of malignancy and a specific Gleason score mentioned for the most severe case discussed (3+4=7), while recognizing the ambiguity around the sample type due to the statement's general nature.

However, a more conservative interpretation, strictly adhering to the task's spirit and the ambiguity of the provided text, might suggest:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the text doesn't directly report on a specific histopathological diagnosis for a single patient or lesion but rather discusses a collection of cases and teaching material. 

Between these interpretations, the first one attempts to extract relevant information regarding malignancy and Gleason score from the given context, while the second adheres more strictly to the notion that the text doesn't represent a standard histopathological statement for a single patient. 

For the purpose of this task and following the instructions closely, the most appropriate response, given the text does not directly relate to a specific patient's diagnosis and involves complexities around interpreting "the most severe lesion," would lean towards indicating "NA" for fields where specific information is not directly available or applicable.

The final answer is: 
```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
