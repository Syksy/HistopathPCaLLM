To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "tissue cylinders" and mentions the length of the samples, which is typical in biopsy reports. Therefore, we can infer that the sample type is likely "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "tumor growth" and "tumor tissue" in samples (1) and (2), and concludes with the presence of "prostate adenocarcinoma". Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Both samples (1) and (2) contain tumor with Gleason patterns. Sample (1) has Gleason pattern 4 (20%) and 3 (30%), and Sample (2) has Gleason pattern 4 (15%) and 3 (<35%). To determine the Gleason score, we need to identify the major and minor patterns. 
   - For Sample (1), the percentages are 20% for pattern 4 and 30% for pattern 3. The primary (or major) grade is typically the most prevalent pattern, which in this case is pattern 3. Thus, the Gleason score could be considered as 3+4.
   - For Sample (2), the percentages are 15% for pattern 4 and less than 35% for pattern 3. Again, pattern 3 is more prevalent, so the Gleason score is 3+4.

   Both samples have the same Gleason score of 3+4=7. Since we are to report the results from the most severe lesion and both have the same Gleason score, we can report either. The statement does not provide further details to differentiate their severity beyond the Gleason score.

Given the information and the need to follow the instructions to the letter, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the analysis of the most severe lesion based on the available information, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
