To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it discusses prostate tissue and Gleason differentiation patterns, it's reasonable to infer that the samples are likely from a biopsy. Yet, the exact type isn't clearly stated, and the description doesn't directly align with the typical descriptions of RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Since it's not explicitly mentioned and the context doesn't strongly suggest a specific type, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of samples that were initially thought to contain PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) changes but were later considered unreliable. It concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified. This implies that there is uncertainty or insufficient evidence to confirm malignancy. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The correct interpretation is "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions assessing Gleason differentiation patterns for Sample (1) but notes that due to differing views, the case will be discussed at the next uro-meeting. It doesn't provide a definitive Gleason score. For Sample (2), it states that differentiation could not be assessed. Thus, a specific Gleason grade isn't reported. Given this, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because a definitive score isn't provided.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" (since the exact sample type isn't clearly mentioned)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (as the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since a definitive Gleason score isn't provided)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
