To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate". Prostatectomy is often abbreviated as "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor", which confirms the presence of a malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason grades, stating "where the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." This implies the Gleason score is 3+4. However, it does not explicitly state the sum. The sum of 3+4 is 7. Therefore, the Gleason grade can be structured as "3+4=7".

Given the information and the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
