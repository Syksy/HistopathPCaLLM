To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples marked with indices A-C for material attributed to apex and indices D-F for sources closer to basis, and mentions "recent radiation therapy," which suggests that the sample is likely from a surgical procedure or biopsy. The exact type isn't specified, but given the context, it seems more related to a surgical specimen or biopsy rather than TURP. However, without a clear indication, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or RP, but given the context, it might be leaning towards a biopsy or a prostatectomy specimen. Since it's not explicitly stated, and there's no clear indication that it's TURP, we'll have to consider it as not clearly defined.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Histological inspection reveals that the material from apex and basis is very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy." It implies that there was an attempt to assess malignancy or tumor characteristics but was hindered by the effects of radiation therapy. It references a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" from clinical notes, suggesting that there was a malignant tumor finding, but the histopathological assessment is complicated by the recent RT. Thus, we can infer that there were malignant tumor findings or at least a suspicion of it.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions a "possible 'Gleason sum 7'" from clinical notes but indicates that it's unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the sum was verified. The histopathology report cannot confirm the Gleason grade due to the recent radiation therapy. Thus, while there's a mention of Gleason sum 7, it's not a confirmed or reported Gleason grade from the histopathological examination.

Given these considerations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly specify the sample type, so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: Despite the difficulty in assessing due to radiation therapy, there's an implication of malignancy or suspected malignancy ("possible 'Gleason sum 7'"), so it should be considered as "yes".
- **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not definitively reported due to the effects of radiation therapy, so it should be considered as "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
