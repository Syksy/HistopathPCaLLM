To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." This context suggests a procedure where tissue is shaved or resected and then examined. The term "shavings" is most commonly associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which involves removing prostate tissue in the form of shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Carcinoma was histologically detected," meaning there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: It is reported as "Gleason 3+3=6," which directly corresponds to the required format for the Gleason grade.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP" because the statement refers to "shavings," which is typical for TURP procedures.
- **Malignancy**: "yes" since carcinoma was detected.
- **Gleason Grade**: "3+3=6" as directly mentioned in the statement.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
