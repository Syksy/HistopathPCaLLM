To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes." This context suggests a procedure where tissue is shaved or removed and examined, which is typical for a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. TURP is a surgery used to treat an enlarged prostate and involves removing prostate tissue in small shavings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Carcinoma was histologically detected," meaning there were malignant tumor findings. So, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grade as "3+3=6," which directly corresponds to the required format for the Gleason score.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (in this case, the only lesion mentioned).
