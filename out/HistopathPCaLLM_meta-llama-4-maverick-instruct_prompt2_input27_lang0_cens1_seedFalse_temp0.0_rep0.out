To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the questions provided.

1. **What is the original sample type?**
   - The statement mentions "prostate tissue was run in eight batches" and "samples indexed F and G." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context, it is likely referring to a biopsy or possibly a prostatectomy (RP) specimen being analyzed in batches. The exact sample type isn't directly stated, but based on the information given, it seems to be related to a prostate tissue sample. Since it's not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and considering the context doesn't directly imply any of these, the safest interpretation would be "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Were there malignant tumor findings?**
   - The statement mentions "growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation" and "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." The presence of a "Gleason score" implies malignancy, as Gleason scoring is used for prostate cancer. However, the statement is ambiguous regarding the confirmation of malignancy, using terms like "debatably" and "maybe." Despite this ambiguity, the mention of Gleason score suggests that there was some level of suspicion or indication of malignancy. Therefore, interpreting this as "yes" could be considered due to the context of discussing Gleason scores, which are relevant to malignant tumors.

3. **What is the reported Gleason grade?**
   - The statement mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." There's no clear mention of a secondary Gleason grade or a sum. The Gleason score is not definitively stated, and there's no clear "major+minor=sum" format provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade cannot be confidently determined in the required format. However, since there's some mention of a Gleason score (albeit uncertain), one might be tempted to try and extract a value. Yet, given the uncertainty and lack of a clear "major+minor=sum" format, it's more appropriate to consider it as "NA" due to the ambiguity and lack of a definitive score.

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (though the statement doesn't clearly indicate multiple lesions, it does discuss multiple samples) and adhering to the allowed values, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the available information and the constraints provided for the structured data format. The ambiguity in the statement leads to cautious interpretations, especially for "Sampletype" and "Gleason."
