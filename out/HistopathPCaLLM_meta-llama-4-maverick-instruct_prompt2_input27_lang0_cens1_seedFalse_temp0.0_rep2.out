To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Total dozen grams of source prostate tissue was run in eight batches." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). However, it refers to "prostate tissue," which could be from various sources. The specific type isn't clearly mentioned, so we have to infer or directly state "NA" if not clearly identifiable.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "the growth patterns in the rest of the samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation," which implies that there is some discussion about tumor or malignant characteristics, but it doesn't directly confirm malignancy. It suggests that some samples might not be clearly malignant or following typical tumor differentiation patterns. The presence of "debatably Gleason score 3" implies some level of malignancy consideration, but it's not conclusive.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "debatably Gleason score 3 could maybe be seen in small quantities." This implies that there is some discussion about a Gleason score, but it's not definitively stated. The Gleason score is mentioned as possibly being "3," but there's no clear major and minor score or sum provided.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it should be considered as "NA".
- **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't conclusively confirm malignancy; it discusses tumor differentiation and mentions a possible Gleason score, but the context is not definitive. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement on malignancy.
- **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason score is mentioned as possibly "3" but without a clear major and minor score or sum, and it's not definitive. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA".

Thus, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not clearly and definitively provide the required information to fill in the structured fields according to the allowed values.
