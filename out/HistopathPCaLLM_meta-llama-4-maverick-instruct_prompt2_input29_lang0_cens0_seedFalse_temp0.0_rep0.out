To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes how samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. The key here is to identify if it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or NA (Not Available/Not Applicable). The description suggests a surgical specimen, and given the detail about the prostate being obtained fresh and sampled in a specific manner, it is likely referring to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the left lobe sections, which confirms malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." This description is somewhat confusing because it mentions "mostly grade 4" and "smaller portion as grade 4," which seems to imply a Gleason score of 4+4. The SUMMARY section directly states "Score sum 7," which could imply a Gleason score of 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Given that the majority of the tumor is described as grade 4, it is more likely that the Gleason score is 4+3=7.

Based on this analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion described and adheres to the required format.
