To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes how samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. The key term here is "Prostate" and the context implies it is a surgical specimen. The description suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) because it describes sampling from different parts of the prostate gland, which is typical for a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "invasive adenocarcinoma" in the left lobe sections, which confirms malignancy. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement describes the tumor cells as forming "both poorly differentiated as well fused glandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." This description implies a Gleason score where the primary and secondary grades are both 4. The summary mentions "Score sum 7", which suggests a Gleason score of 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. Given that the statement says "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4", it seems there might be a typographical error in the statement because it doesn't clearly differentiate between the primary and secondary grades if both are grade 4. However, the mention of "Score sum 7" and the description suggests that the Gleason score should be interpreted as 4+3=7, assuming the "smaller portion" refers to a different grade (3) not explicitly stated as such but implied through the sum.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This interpretation assumes that despite the somewhat ambiguous description regarding the Gleason grades, the sum provided and the context allow for a reasonable inference of the Gleason score as 4+3=7.
