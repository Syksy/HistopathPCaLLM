To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and lists samples taken from different parts of the prostate (left lower, right lower, left middle, right middle, left higher, right higher). It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given that multiple samples were taken from different locations, it is reasonable to infer that the sample type is a "biopsy." There's no clear indication that it's a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Therefore, the sample type can be considered as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "tumor cells" and the assessment of "potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure," which indicates the presence of malignant findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," which implies that there was an attempt to assess the Gleason score but it could not be determined. Despite the presence of tumor cells, the Gleason grade is not provided. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because it was not possible to determine it.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
