To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained" and lists samples taken from different parts of the prostate (left lower, right lower, left middle, right middle, left higher, right higher). It refers to these as "samples" without directly stating the type (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests these are biopsy samples because it talks about sampling from different parts of the prostate. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed," indicating the presence of tumor cells, hence malignancy is "yes". Although it notes that samples A and C were not prostatic tissue, suggesting contamination, the presence of tumor cells is mentioned.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Score sum determination was not possible," indicating that a Gleason score could not be determined. However, it does not directly state that the samples were benign or malignant regarding Gleason grading. Since malignancy is indicated ("tumor cells"), but the Gleason score is not provided, we should still consider it as having a malignancy. For Gleason grade, since it's not provided and the statement directly says "Score sum determination was not possible," we will have to consider it as "NA" because we cannot infer the exact Gleason score.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
