To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical removal of the prostate, which aligns with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, it's also mentioned as an "autopsy sample," which is not among the listed allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "RP" is the closest relevant clinical sample type mentioned and it directly relates to the prostate, we will consider it. However, the confusion arises with the mention of "autopsy sample." Given the context that it's described as a "fresh prostatectomy specimen" initially, we might lean towards "RP" if we had to choose a clinical context. Yet, it's critical to note that an autopsy sample doesn't fit the typical clinical diagnostic categories provided.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." It also mentions that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." This indicates there were no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the prostate tissue is benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that the sample is also described as an "autopsy sample," which doesn't fit the provided categories. If strictly interpreting the given categories and focusing on the initial description as a "prostatectomy specimen," the above JSON is derived. For a more accurate representation considering the provided categories and the complexity of the statement, one might argue for "NA" in "Sampletype" due to the ambiguity and the fact that "autopsy sample" doesn't fit the given choices. Thus, an alternative could be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This alternative aligns with the fact that "autopsy sample" is not among the allowed values for "Sampletype," and it reflects the benign nature of the findings.
