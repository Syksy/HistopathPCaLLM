To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. However, it is then clarified that the original sample is actually from an autopsy. Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values for "Sampletype" and given that the closest related surgical specimen type is mentioned first, there might be confusion. However, "RP" is the closest valid answer related to a "prostatectomy specimen." Yet, considering the statement's clarification that it's an autopsy sample, the most accurate representation given the allowed values would be "NA" because "autopsy" is not listed among the allowed sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth," "the resection surfaces are confirmed to be clean," "the capsule is showing no abnormal growth," and "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." It concludes that the prostate tissue contains "at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." This clearly indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the "Gleason" field should be "NA."

Therefore, based on the given statement and the required structure, the JSON output should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the sample type is not among the specified allowed values (as it's an autopsy sample), there were no malignant findings, and thus, no Gleason grade is reported.
