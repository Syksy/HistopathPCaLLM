To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. However, it is then clarified that the original sample is actually from an autopsy. Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values for "Sampletype," and given that the context suggests a post-mortem examination rather than a surgical procedure like RP, TURP, or biopsy, we will have to choose the closest or most appropriate value from the given options. "RP" seems to be the closest in terms of involving the prostate, but it's not entirely accurate due to the autopsy context. However, none of the provided options directly correspond to "autopsy." Therefore, we will have to select "NA" as it is the most appropriate given the constraints.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth," "the resection surfaces are confirmed to be clean," "the capsule is showing no abnormal growth," and "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." It concludes that "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." This clearly indicates there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the prostate tissue is benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, "Gleason" should be "NA."

Therefore, based on the given statement and the required structure, the JSON output should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output adheres to the specified format and captures the essence of the histopathological statement provided.
