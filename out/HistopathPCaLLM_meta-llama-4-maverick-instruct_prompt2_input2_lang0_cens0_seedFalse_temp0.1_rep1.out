To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical removal of the prostate, which aligns with "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, it's also mentioned as an "autopsy sample," which is not among the listed allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Given that "RP" is the closest relevant surgical procedure mentioned and "autopsy" is not an allowed value, we will consider it as "RP" because the primary description is of a prostatectomy specimen.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth" and concludes that "Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." This implies there were no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the growth is benign and there's no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason grades, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
