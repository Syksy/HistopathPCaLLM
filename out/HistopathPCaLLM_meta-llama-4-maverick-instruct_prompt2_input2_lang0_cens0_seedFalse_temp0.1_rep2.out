To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" and later refers to it as "the original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." The term "prostatectomy specimen" typically refers to a surgical specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is a surgical procedure to remove the prostate gland. However, it is then clarified that the original sample is actually from an autopsy. Despite this, the initial description as a "prostatectomy specimen" is more relevant to the context of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values and given that the sample is described in a manner that suggests a significant surgical specimen, we might lean towards interpreting it based on the closest surgical context provided. However, the precise nature (autopsy) doesn't directly fit the given categories. Therefore, the closest interpretation related to prostate tissue examination would be "RP" due to the mention of "prostatectomy specimen," but it's worth noting the statement's complexity.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth," "the resection surfaces are confirmed to be clean," "the capsule is showing no abnormal growth," and "seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth." These statements collectively indicate that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the prostate tissue is benign with no tumor growth identified, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: Although the sample is described as an autopsy sample, the closest match from the given options, based on the initial description as a "prostatectomy specimen," could be considered as "RP". However, it's critical to acknowledge that the statement describes it as an autopsy sample. For the sake of this task and given the available options, "RP" might be considered due to the context of a "prostatectomy specimen," but ideally, it should be noted that "autopsy" is not an option.
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

It's worth noting that the sample type is somewhat ambiguously described, with both "prostatectomy specimen" and "autopsy sample" being mentioned. The structured data provided is based on the closest interpretation given the constraints of the allowed values.
