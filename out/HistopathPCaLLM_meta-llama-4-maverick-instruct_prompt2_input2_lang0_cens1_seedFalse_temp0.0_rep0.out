To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample is obtained from "an autopsy specimen." The allowed values for sample type are "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values, and there's no clear indication that it corresponds to any of the given options directly, the sample type should be considered as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of "inflammatory and age-related changes" and mentions the potential for "adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but concludes that the samples can "only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies that there are no definitive findings of malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy status should be considered "NA" because the statement does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned or implied in the statement. The statement does not provide a Gleason score or any information that could be used to infer it. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the given statement does not provide sufficient information to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade according to the specified allowed values.
