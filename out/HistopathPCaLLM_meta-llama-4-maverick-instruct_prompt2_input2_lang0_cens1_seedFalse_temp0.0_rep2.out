To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Instead, it is mentioned as an "autopsy specimen," which does not directly correspond to any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, the most appropriate answer for "Sampletype" would be "NA" since it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of "inflammatory and age-related changes" and mentions that "the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." The use of "potential" indicates that malignancy is not confirmed. Hence, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not definitively stated, making "NA" (Not Available or Not Applicable) the most suitable choice for "Malignancy" due to the lack of a clear "yes" or "no" indication.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma but does not confirm malignancy or provide a Gleason score. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" as there's no reported Gleason grade.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the given statement does not provide clear or direct information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade according to the allowed values and the specifics of the histopathological statement provided.
