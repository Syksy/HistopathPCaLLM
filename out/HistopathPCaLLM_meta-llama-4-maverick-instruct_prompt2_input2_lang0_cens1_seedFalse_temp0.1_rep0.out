To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that the sample is obtained from "an autopsy specimen." The allowed values for sample type are "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "NA" (Not Available/Applicable). Since "autopsy" is not among the allowed values, and there's no clear indication that it corresponds to any of the given options directly, the sample type should be considered as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of "inflammatory and age-related changes" and mentions the potential for "adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but concludes that the samples can "only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies that there's no definitive diagnosis of malignancy due to the limitations in the sample quality and the dominance of other changes. Therefore, the presence of malignancy is not confirmed, making "NA" the most appropriate answer due to the lack of a clear "yes" or "no" regarding malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned or implied in the statement. The statement does refer to "potential adenocarcinoma," indicating that there might be some suspicion or consideration of malignancy, but it does not provide a Gleason score. Therefore, "NA" is the appropriate value for the Gleason grade.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects that the given statement does not provide clear or direct information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade according to the specified allowed values and the context of the statement.
