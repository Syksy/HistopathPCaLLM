Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. The sample type is not clearly identified as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". The statement mentions that the sample is obtained from an "autopsy specimen", which is not among the allowed values. Therefore, the "Sampletype" is "NA".
2. The statement does not provide a clear indication of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that the samples "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes", but it does not confirm the presence of malignancy. Therefore, the "Malignancy" field is "NA".
3. The Gleason grade is not reported in the statement. In fact, it mentions that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. Therefore, the "Gleason" field is "NA".
