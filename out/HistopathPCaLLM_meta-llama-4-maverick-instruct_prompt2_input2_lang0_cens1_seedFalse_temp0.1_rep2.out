To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Instead, it is mentioned as an "autopsy specimen," which does not directly correspond to any of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, the most appropriate answer for "Sampletype" would be "NA" since it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of "inflammatory and age-related changes" and mentions that further inspection is required to characterize "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes." This implies that there is no definitive diagnosis of malignancy from the sample due to its condition. Thus, the presence of malignant tumor findings is not confirmed, making "Malignancy" equal to "NA" because it's not definitively "yes" or "no" based on the information provided.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade. It mentions the potential for adenocarcinoma but does not confirm malignancy or provide Gleason grades. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" as there's no reported Gleason grade.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the given statement does not provide sufficient or clear information to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade according to the allowed values and the specific requirements for structuring the data.
