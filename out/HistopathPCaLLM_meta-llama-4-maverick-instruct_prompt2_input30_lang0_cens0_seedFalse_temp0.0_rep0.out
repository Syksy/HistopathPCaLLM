To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure because it involves chippings and is near urothelial cells, which is typical for TURP samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the primary pattern is grade 4, the secondary pattern is grade 3, and there's a tertiary pattern grade 5. The most relevant Gleason score to report in this context, focusing on the most severe lesion and following common practice, would be the sum of the primary and secondary patterns, which is 4+3=7.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data captures the essence of the histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format.
