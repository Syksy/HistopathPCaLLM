To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure because it involves chippings and is near urothelial cells, which is typical for TURP samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that the primary pattern is grade 4, the secondary pattern is grade 3, and there's a tertiary pattern grade 5. The original diagnosis was "3+3", but it was updated. For the Gleason score, the most significant (highest) grades are typically considered for the score, which in this context, seems to be focused on the primary and secondary patterns for the sum, hence "4+3=7". The mention of a tertiary pattern grade 5 is important but the primary and secondary patterns are used for the Gleason score.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the above analysis:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given statement.
