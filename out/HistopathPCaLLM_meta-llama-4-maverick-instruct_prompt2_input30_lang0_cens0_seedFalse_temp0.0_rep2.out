To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells." This context suggests that the sample is likely from a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure because it involves chippings and is near urothelial cells, which is typical for TURP samples.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses the presence of adenocarcinoma, indicating malignancy. It mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma," confirming that the findings were malignant.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as follows: the most common pattern is grade 4, the secondary pattern is grade 3, and there's a mention of a tertiary pattern grade 5. The original diagnosis was "3+3," which was updated. The most relevant Gleason score mentioned for the most severe lesion includes grades 4 and 3. Although a tertiary pattern of grade 5 is mentioned, the primary and secondary patterns (4 and 3) are used to determine the Gleason score, which is "4+3=7."

Given this analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON response reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics as described in the histopathological statement, adhering to the required format and allowed values.
