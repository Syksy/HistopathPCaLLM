To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" without specifying the sample type. Therefore, the sample type is not clearly identified, leading to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but does not confirm malignancy. It states that the suspicions could not be confirmed or denied, and the earlier uncertain diagnosis "could therefore not be determined." This implies that there was no definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Hence, the malignancy status is not "yes". Since there's a mention of suspicion and uncertainty regarding the diagnosis, it's not a clear "no" either. The statement suggests that further examination is required, indicating the status is uncertain or not determined. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement does not conclusively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It discusses uncertainties regarding the findings and the need for further examination without providing any information on the Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects that the given statement does not provide sufficient or clear information to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade.
