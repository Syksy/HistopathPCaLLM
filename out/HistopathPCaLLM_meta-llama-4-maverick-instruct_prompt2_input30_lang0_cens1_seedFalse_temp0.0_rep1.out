To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" without specifying the sample type. Therefore, the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, leading to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses "atypical findings" and "uncertainties regarding the findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the suspicions could not be confirmed or denied, and further examination is required. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, the value for malignancy should be "NA" because it's neither confirmed nor denied.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The discussion revolves around uncertainties and the need for further examination without referencing any Gleason scores. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the provided instructions and the example given for a statement that is not a valid histopathological statement regarding the required information.
