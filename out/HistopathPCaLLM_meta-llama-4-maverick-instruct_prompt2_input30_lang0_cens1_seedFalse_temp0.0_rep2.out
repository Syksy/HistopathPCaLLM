To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to an "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION" without specifying the sample type. Therefore, the sample type is not clearly identified, leading to "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "atypical findings were suspected in the cells" but does not confirm malignancy. It indicates that the diagnosis could not be determined and requires further examination. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the value for malignancy should be "NA" as it is neither confirmed "yes" nor "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. It discusses uncertain or atypical findings without confirming malignancy or providing a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the instructions and the example provided for non-valid histopathological statements.
