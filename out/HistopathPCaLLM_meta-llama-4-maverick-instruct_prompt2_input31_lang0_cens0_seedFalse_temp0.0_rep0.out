To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies." Since the task is to consider the most severe lesion and the second targeted biopsy is mentioned to have hit a large focus with significant details about the Gleason grade, we will consider "biopsy" as the sample type because all samples mentioned are biopsies.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "a minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6" in the initial biopsy and a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" in the second targeted biopsy. The presence of a Gleason grade indicates malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The most severe lesion is described in the context of the second targeted biopsy, where the primary differentiation pattern is 4, and the second most common is 5. This implies a Gleason score of 4+5. The sum of these grades is 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+5=9."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion described.
