To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies." Since the task is to consider the most severe lesion and the second targeted biopsy is mentioned as having a significant finding ("a large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4"), the sample type for this significant finding is "biopsy." All biopsies mentioned are considered under the general category of "biopsy" for this purpose.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings through phrases like "minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6" and "a large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4." The presence of Gleason scores directly implies malignancy. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The most severe lesion is described in the context of the second targeted biopsy, where the primary differentiation pattern is 4 and the second most common is 5. This implies a Gleason score of 4+5. The sum of these grades is 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+5=9."

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
