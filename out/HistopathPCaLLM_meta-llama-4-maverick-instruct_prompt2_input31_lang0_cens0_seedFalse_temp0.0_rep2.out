To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routine systematic biopsy" and "targeted biopsies." Since the most severe lesion's details are required and the statement highlights the findings from the "second targeted biopsy," the sample type is "biopsy." The specific type (systematic or targeted) isn't required; hence, "biopsy" is appropriate.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of a malignant tumor with phrases like "minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6" and later mentions a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" and a "second most common differentiation pattern is 5." This confirms the presence of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement initially mentions a "Gleason 3+3=6" tumor. However, it later describes a more severe tumor with a "primary differentiation pattern 4" and a "second most common differentiation pattern is 5," indicating a Gleason score of "4+5=9." Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion, "4+5=9" is the appropriate value.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
