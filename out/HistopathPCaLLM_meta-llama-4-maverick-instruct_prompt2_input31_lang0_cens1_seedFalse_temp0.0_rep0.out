Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. The statement does not clearly indicate the type of sample taken, so "Sampletype" is "NA".
2. The statement mentions "suspicious findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement, so "Gleason" is "NA".

The statement appears to be more related to the patient's symptoms, treatment, and sampling issues rather than a clear histopathological diagnosis, which is why the structured data is "NA" for all three fields.
