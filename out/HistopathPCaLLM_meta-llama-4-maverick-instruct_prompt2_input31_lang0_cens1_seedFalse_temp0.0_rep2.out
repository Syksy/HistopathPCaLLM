Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data in JSON format.

The statement does not provide clear information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. Here's my reasoning:

1. Sample type: The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" but does not specify the type of sample. It is not clear if it is a biopsy, RP, TURP, or something else. Therefore, the sample type is "NA".
2. Malignancy: The statement mentions "suspicious findings" but does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor cells. It also states that "interpretation of tissue proved difficult", indicating uncertainty. Therefore, the malignancy is "NA".
3. Gleason grade: There is no mention of Gleason grade or any related information. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
