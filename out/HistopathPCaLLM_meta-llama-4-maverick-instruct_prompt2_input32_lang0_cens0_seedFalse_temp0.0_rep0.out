To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports multiple Gleason patterns observed in the adenocarcinoma, including "Gleason 4+4 pattern" along with other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and "4+4" is mentioned specifically as being observed and is one of the higher grades mentioned, we will consider "4+4=8" as the Gleason score for the most severe lesion.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
