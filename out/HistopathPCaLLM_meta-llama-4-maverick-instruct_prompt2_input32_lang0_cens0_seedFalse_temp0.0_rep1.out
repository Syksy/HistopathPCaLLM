To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes". However, it's also mentioned that the examined lymph nodes and seminal vesicles "are clear of cancer, so the findings are benign" in those specific samples. The presence of adenocarcinoma indicates malignancy in the prostate tissue.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports multiple Gleason patterns observed in the adenocarcinoma, including "Gleason 4+4" along with other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. The most severe lesion is typically considered by looking at the highest Gleason score or sum. Here, the highest Gleason sum mentioned is 8 (from 4+4), making "4+4=8" the most severe Gleason grade reported.

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion found.
