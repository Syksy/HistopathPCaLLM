To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "The patient originally underwent a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there was "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate," which means there were malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes". However, it's also mentioned that "The examined seminal vesicles (samples 3 and 4) are also clear of cancer, so the findings are benign" in the context of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. The presence of adenocarcinoma indicates malignancy in the prostate tissue itself.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports multiple Gleason patterns observed in the original multifocal adenocarcinoma, including "Gleason 4+4" along with other patterns like 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. The most severe lesion is typically considered by the highest Gleason score or sum. Here, the highest Gleason sum mentioned is 4+4=8. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+4=8".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given histopathological statement.
