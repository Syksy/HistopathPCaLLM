To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the samples are from different locations" and refers to "the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it implies that the samples could be related to a significant surgical procedure given the mention of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear." The term "primary prostate tissue" suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) since it's a more extensive examination including lymph nodes and seminal vesicles. However, the statement is not explicit, and there's no direct mention of "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Given the context, the most likely sample type is "RP" due to the mention of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, but it's not a clear indication. Therefore, the sample type is not directly stated, so it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "the findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain" but does not specify what those findings are. It does state that "the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear," which implies no metastasis was found in these areas, but it doesn't directly address the presence or absence of malignancy in the prostate tissue itself. Without a clear statement regarding malignancy, this should be considered "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement lacks specific information regarding the sample type, the presence or absence of malignancy, and the Gleason grade.
