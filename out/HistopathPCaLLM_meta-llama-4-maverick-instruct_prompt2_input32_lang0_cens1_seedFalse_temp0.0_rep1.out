To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the samples are from different locations" and refers to "the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it implies that the samples could be related to a significant surgical procedure given the mention of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined." The term "original primary prostate tissue" could imply a radical prostatectomy (RP). However, the information is not clear or direct enough to conclusively determine the sample type as "RP" or any other specific type without ambiguity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because the sample type isn't explicitly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "the findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain" but does not specify what those findings are. It does state that "the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear," which implies no malignancy was found in those specific tissues, but it doesn't directly address the prostate tissue's malignancy status. Given the lack of explicit information about malignancy in the prostate tissue itself, the most appropriate answer is "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The absence of any reference to Gleason grades or scores means that we cannot determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, the answer for the Gleason grade is "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
