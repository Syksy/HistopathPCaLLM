To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the samples are from different locations" and refers to "the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it implies that the samples could be related to a significant surgical procedure given the mention of "lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined." The term "original primary prostate tissue" could imply a radical prostatectomy (RP). However, the information is not definitive.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions that "the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear," which implies a context where malignancy might be a concern, but it does not directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the prostate tissue itself.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all.

Given the information and the instructions:

- For "Sampletype," since the statement implies a significant surgical specimen and mentions "original primary prostate tissue" along with examination of lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, it could be inferred as "RP." However, it's not a direct statement, and the sample type is not explicitly mentioned.
- For "Malignancy," there's no direct statement about the presence or absence of malignancy.
- For "Gleason," there's no information provided.

Therefore, due to the lack of direct information regarding the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade, and considering the statement does not directly provide the required information, the structured data should reflect the absence of clear information.

The structured answer in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
