To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate." Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP." Therefore, the sample type is "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of a tumor and mentions that it "has penetrated the capsule," which implies malignancy. It also talks about a finding in lymph nodes (N1), further indicating malignancy. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3." This indicates that there are areas with both Gleason scores 3+4 and 4+3. Since 4+3 is more severe than 3+4 (because the higher grade is more prevalent), the most severe lesion has a Gleason score of 4+3=7. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+3=7."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This structured data represents the most severe lesion's characteristics as per the given histopathological statement.
