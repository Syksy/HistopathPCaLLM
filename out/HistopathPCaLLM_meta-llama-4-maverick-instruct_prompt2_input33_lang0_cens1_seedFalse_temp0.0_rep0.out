To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the given instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to "Collected samples" and "processed samples" but does not specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is "NA" because it cannot be determined from the information provided.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles," which indicates that there is no confirmed malignancy in the mentioned context. However, the presence of "possibly abnormal findings" is not a definitive indicator of malignancy. Since there's no clear statement about malignant tumor findings being present or absent in the main sample (only a mention of "possibly abnormal findings" in lymph nodes and no malignancy in seminal vehicles), the most accurate interpretation based on the given text is that it leans towards not having a clear "yes" for malignancy. Therefore, the value for malignancy is considered "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding the malignancy of the tumor findings in the sample.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" as it is not applicable or mentioned.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output is consistent with the example provided for a statement that is not a valid histopathological statement regarding the required information.
