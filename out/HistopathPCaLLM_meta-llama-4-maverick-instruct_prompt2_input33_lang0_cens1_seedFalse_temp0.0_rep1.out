To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to "Collected samples" and "processed samples" but does not specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is "NA" because it cannot be determined from the information given.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles," which indicates that there is no confirmed malignancy in the mentioned context. However, the presence of "possibly abnormal findings" could imply a suspicion or need for further investigation regarding malignancy in lymph nodes. Despite this, the statement does not directly confirm malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because the statement does not directly confirm or deny malignancy in the context required.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or any related information. The Gleason grade is used for prostate cancer grading, and its absence, combined with the lack of a clear indication of prostate cancer diagnosis, means the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects that the statement does not provide sufficient or clear information to determine the sample type, confirm malignancy, or report a Gleason grade.
