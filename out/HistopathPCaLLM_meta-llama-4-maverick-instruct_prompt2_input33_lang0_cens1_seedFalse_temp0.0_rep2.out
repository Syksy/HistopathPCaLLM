To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not directly mention the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). It refers to "Collected samples" and "processed samples" but does not specify the type. Therefore, the sample type is "NA" because it cannot be determined from the information given.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" but does not confirm malignancy. It explicitly states "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles," which indicates that there is no confirmed malignancy in the mentioned context. However, the presence of "possibly abnormal findings" could imply a suspicion or need for further investigation regarding malignancy in lymph nodes. Still, based on the information given, there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings being confirmed. Thus, the most appropriate answer based on the given text is "NA" because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy in the samples overall.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It discusses pathological findings and mentions lymph nodes and seminal vehicles but does not provide any information related to Gleason grading. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" as it is not applicable or mentioned.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the instructions and the example provided for a statement that does not contain valid histopathological information regarding the required fields.
