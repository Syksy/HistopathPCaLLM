To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr." The term "resection" in the context of prostate pathology often refers to a surgical specimen. Given the options, "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is a type of resection. "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a resection but typically involves chips of prostate tissue. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a "TURP," but it mentions a resection. However, the most likely interpretation based on the given options and the context (weight and preparation into tissue cassettes) is that it is a "RP." Therefore, "Sampletype": "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma... but no malignities." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "Malignancy": "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma (i.e., it's benign), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "Gleason": "NA".

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information from the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof) as described in the histopathological statement.
