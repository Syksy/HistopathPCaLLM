To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr." The term "resection" in the context of prostate pathology often refers to a surgical specimen. Given the context, this is likely referring to a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) since it's a resection and not specifically mentioned as a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the weight and preparation into tissue cassettes could be consistent with various sample types. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) is a plausible interpretation for a "resection" in this context, although it's not a direct mention. TURP is also a type of resection but typically involves chips of tissue. The statement doesn't directly indicate "TURP," and "RP" seems more likely due to the context of a single specimen being resected and weighed. However, without explicit mention, one might be cautious. Still, "RP" is a reasonable choice given the information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "but no malignities." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (Given it's a resection and likely referring to a radical prostatectomy, though not directly stated.)
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
