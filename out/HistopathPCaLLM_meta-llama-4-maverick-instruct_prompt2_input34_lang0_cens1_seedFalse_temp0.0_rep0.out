To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the presented sample" and discusses its weight and preparation into tissue cassettes but does not directly state the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it is weighed and prepared into cassettes, and considering typical histopathological practices, it is likely referring to a surgical specimen. The statement does not explicitly mention "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the description could fit with a prostatectomy specimen or another surgical specimen. Since it's not explicitly mentioned and doesn't directly fit the most common types, we might lean towards "RP" if we consider the weight and preparation as indicative of a significant surgical specimen. However, without explicit mention, the safest categorization based on given instructions would be "NA" due to lack of direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes glands being close to each other and partial cribriform structures, which could be suggestive of malignancy or atypical lesions. However, it explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (presumably meaning prostatic adenocarcinoma or malignancy), and "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are not indicative of malignancy and describes hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, a Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information derived from the histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
