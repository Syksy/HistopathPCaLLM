To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the presented sample" and discusses its weight and preparation into tissue cassettes but does not directly indicate the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it is discussing prostate tissue and the sample is being histologically examined, we can infer it's likely a surgical specimen. The statement doesn't explicitly mention "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), but the description could fit with a prostatectomy or a TURP. However, without explicit information, we should be cautious. The weight (7.5gr) and preparation into six tissue cassettes could be more indicative of a larger specimen like RP rather than a biopsy. Still, it's not conclusive without more specific terms. Therefore, based on the information given, we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of explicit mention.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes glands being very close to each other and partial cribriform structures, which could be suggestive of malignancy or atypical lesions. However, it explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (presumably meaning prostatic adenocarcinoma or malignancy), and "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are not indicative of prostatic malignancy and describes hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, a Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not using nested structures and providing answers based on the most severe lesion (though in this case, there was no malignancy reported). The values are also within the allowed values for each field.
