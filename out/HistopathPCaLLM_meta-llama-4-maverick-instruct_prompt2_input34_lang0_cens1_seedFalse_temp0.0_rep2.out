To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the presented sample" and its weight, and that it "has been prepared into six tissue casettes." It does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but based on the context, we can infer it's likely a surgical specimen. However, the specific type isn't directly mentioned. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Given the information about weight and preparation into tissue cassettes, it could be suggestive of a larger specimen like RP. However, without explicit mention, we should be cautious. The sample is not explicitly described as a biopsy or TURP either. Therefore, we might consider it as potentially "RP" due to the weight and preparation details, but it's not a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes histological findings that include glands being very close to each other and partial cribriform structures. However, it explicitly states "Findings do not indicate prostatic" (presumably meaning prostatic adenocarcinoma or malignancy). It further clarifies that "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates the sample is benign, so "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign ("Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen" and "Findings do not indicate prostatic" malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given these observations:

- **Sampletype**: The statement doesn't directly indicate the sample type. While it could be inferred as "RP" due to the details about weight and preparation, it's not a straightforward classification. Therefore, considering the lack of clear indication towards "biopsy", "TURP", or "RP", and to be conservative, it could be considered as "NA" due to the absence of explicit information.

- **Malignancy**: "no" because the statement indicates the findings are benign.

- **Gleason**: "NA" because the sample is benign.

So, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
