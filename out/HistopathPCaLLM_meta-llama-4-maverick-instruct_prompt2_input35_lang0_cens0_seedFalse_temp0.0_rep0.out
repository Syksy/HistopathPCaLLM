To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative prostate biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of carcinoma." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no signs of carcinoma (malignancy), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
