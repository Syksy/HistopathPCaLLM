To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative prostate biopsies," which directly indicates the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of carcinoma." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no carcinoma (malignant tumor) found, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements.
