To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe." This indicates the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context of examining left and right lobes and mentioning specific histopathological findings, it's likely referring to a biopsy. Yet, the exact type (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't explicitly mentioned. Since "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy and involves examining the whole prostate gland (which has lobes), and the statement doesn't directly imply a surgical removal or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), but rather focuses on lobe examination, one might lean towards it being related to a biopsy or RP. However, the most conservative interpretation without explicit mention of the sample type would be "NA" due to the lack of direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "small high-grade PIN-changes" and "tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia." High-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous lesion but is not cancer itself. Hyperplasia refers to an increase in cell number, which is benign. There's no mention of malignant findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used to grade prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. Since the statement does not mention cancer or provide Gleason grades, and instead discusses PIN changes and hyperplasia, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the information provided in the statement, adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
