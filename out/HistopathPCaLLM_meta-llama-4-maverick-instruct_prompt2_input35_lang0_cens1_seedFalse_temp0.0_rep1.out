To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe." This indicates the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context of examining left and right lobes and mentioning specific histopathological features, it's likely referring to a biopsy. Yet, the exact type (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't explicitly mentioned. Since "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy and involves examining the whole prostate gland (including lobes), and the statement doesn't directly imply a surgical removal or a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), the most likely sample type could be considered as "biopsy" due to the mention of specific sites and lobes. However, without explicit mention, this is an inference. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so a cautious approach would be to consider it as "NA" if we strictly follow the given information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "small high-grade PIN-changes" and "tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia." High-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precancerous lesion but is not cancer itself. Hyperplasia refers to an increase in cell number, which is benign. There's no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used to grade prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. Since the statement doesn't mention any malignant findings, only discussing PIN changes and hyperplasia, the Gleason grade is not applicable here, and thus it should be "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response adheres to the instructions by not providing nested structures and focusing on the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof), and it uses the allowed values for each field.
