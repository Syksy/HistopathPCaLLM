To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe." This indicates the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, given the context of discussing lobes and not explicitly mentioning a biopsy, TURP, or RP, and considering the details provided (like PIN-changes and hyperplasia), it is likely referring to a biopsy. However, without explicit mention, the safest categorization based on the given information and the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA") would lean towards "NA" because it doesn't directly state the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is considered a precursor to cancer but is not cancer itself. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be categorized as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
