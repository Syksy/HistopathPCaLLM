To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "preparate" and the process of preparing "macro casettes and regular cassettes," which is indicative of a surgical specimen. It does not explicitly mention "biopsy," "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), or "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) directly, but given the context (weight and size of the specimen, preparation of multiple cassettes), it is suggestive of a prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the most likely sample type is "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are "No signs of malignity," the Gleason grade is not applicable, and hence it should be "NA."

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data adheres to the required format and captures the essence of the histopathological statement provided.
