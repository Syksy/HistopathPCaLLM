To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and talks about preparing "8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." This context suggests a significant tissue sample, which is more indicative of a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) specimen due to the size and weight mentioned, rather than a biopsy or TURP. However, without explicit mention of "RP," one might consider the context. The size and the preparation of multiple cassettes suggest it's not a biopsy. TURP is a possibility but the size (7 x 6 x 5 cm) and weight (80gr) are more suggestive of a prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information extracted from the given histopathological statement in valid JSON format, adhering to the specified requirements and allowed values.
