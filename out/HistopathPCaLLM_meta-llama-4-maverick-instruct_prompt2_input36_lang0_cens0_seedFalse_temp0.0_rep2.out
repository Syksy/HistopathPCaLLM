To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm" and talks about preparing "8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." This context suggests a significant tissue sample, which is more indicative of a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) specimen due to the size and weight mentioned, rather than a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). TURP specimens are typically smaller and the description doesn't directly suggest a TURP. Biopsy specimens are usually much smaller and not described in such macroscopic detail regarding size and weight. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of malignity or inflammation." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy reported, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
