To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes" and refers to macroscopic and microscopic examination, but it does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it's likely a biopsy or possibly a TURP due to the mention of macroscopic and microscopic examination without specifying a radical prostatectomy (RP). The exact sample type isn't directly stated, so we might lean towards "NA" if it doesn't clearly fit into the other categories based on the given information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but indicates that malignancy was "not assessed reliably." There's no clear mention of malignant findings. The lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy and the indication that it wasn't assessed reliably suggests that we should consider this as "NA" for malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade, and given that the sample wasn't assessed for malignancy reliably, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Given the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type, so "NA" is appropriate.
- **Malignancy**: Malignancy was not assessed reliably, so "NA" is appropriate.
- **Gleason Grade**: Not mentioned, so "NA" is appropriate.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
