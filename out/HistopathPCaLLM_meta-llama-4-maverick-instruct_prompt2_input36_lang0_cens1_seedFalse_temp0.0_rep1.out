To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it's likely a biopsy or possibly a TURP due to the mention of cassettes, which are commonly used in pathology for processing tissue samples. Yet, there's no explicit mention of the sample type. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but explicitly states that malignancy was "not assessed reliably." It implies there's no clear indication of malignancy, and the assessment for malignancy wasn't reliable. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement doesn't directly confirm or deny malignancy with reliability.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the mention of hyperplasia (a benign condition), suggests that the Gleason grade is not applicable here. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, the unreliability of malignancy assessment, and the absence of Gleason grading in the provided histopathological statement.
