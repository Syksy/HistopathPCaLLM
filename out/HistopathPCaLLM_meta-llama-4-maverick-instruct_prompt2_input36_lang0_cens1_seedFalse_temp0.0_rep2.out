To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes" and refers to macroscopic and microscopic examination, but it does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it's likely a biopsy or possibly a TURP due to the mention of macroscopic and microscopic examination without explicitly stating it's a radical prostatectomy (RP). The statement doesn't directly support identifying the sample type as "biopsy" or "TURP" with certainty. Therefore, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "nodular hyperplasia" and "epithelial hyperplasia" but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. It explicitly states that the malignancy was "not assessed reliably," which implies there was no clear assessment or diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we should consider "Malignancy" as "no" because there's no mention of cancer being detected.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the histopathological statement according to the required structure.
