To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves the removal of prostate tissue through electrosection, typically done in TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and mentions "minor inflammation in typical places" and concludes that "Findings indicate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignancy or cancer; instead, it indicates hyperplasia, which is benign. Therefore, the malignancy is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
