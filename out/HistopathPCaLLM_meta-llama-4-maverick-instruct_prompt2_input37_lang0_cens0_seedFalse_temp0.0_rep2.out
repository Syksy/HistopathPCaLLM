To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings" which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the findings as "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and mentions "minor inflammation in typical places" and concludes that "Findings indicate hyperplasia." There is no mention of malignancy or cancer; instead, it indicates a benign condition (hyperplasia).

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. The Gleason grade is used for assessing the prognosis of men with prostate cancer, and it's not relevant for benign conditions.

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP" because the tissue was obtained through electrosection chippings, which is characteristic of TURP.
- **Malignancy**: "no" since the findings indicate hyperplasia, a benign condition, and there's no mention of cancer.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the Gleason grade is not applicable for benign conditions.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
