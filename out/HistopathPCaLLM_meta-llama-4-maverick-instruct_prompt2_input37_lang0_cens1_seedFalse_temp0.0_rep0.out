To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sample material" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue with "partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The description does not clearly indicate cancer; hence, we cannot conclusively determine malignancy. The statement seems to lean towards a benign or non-specific finding, but it explicitly states that "further examination was not possible at this time," indicating that a definitive assessment of malignancy might not have been made. Therefore, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes" or "no," so it should be considered "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade, and given that the statement does not clearly indicate malignancy, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
