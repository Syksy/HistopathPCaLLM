To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sample material" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue with "partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The description does not clearly indicate cancer; hence, we cannot conclusively determine malignancy. Given the information is not definitive regarding malignancy, and there's no clear indication of cancer, it leans towards being "NA" or potentially "no" if we consider the absence of a clear malignancy indication. However, the statement's ambiguity and lack of a definitive diagnosis regarding malignancy make "NA" a more appropriate choice due to the statement not being conclusive.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. The Gleason grade is only relevant for malignant findings, and since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason score is mentioned, it should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, the presence or absence of malignancy, and the Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
