To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "sample material" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate tissue with "partial nodular glandcomponents" and mentions "minor inflammation in places" but does not explicitly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. The description does not clearly indicate cancer, so we cannot conclusively determine malignancy. However, the absence of a clear indication of malignancy and the lack of specific mention of cancer or tumor cells might lean towards it being benign or "NA" for malignancy. Since it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy, we'll consider it as "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. The Gleason grade is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer cases. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, it should be considered as "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
