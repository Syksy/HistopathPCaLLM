To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy, as needle biopsies are a form of biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "No suspected malignity." This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of malignancy or Gleason grades in the statement, and it explicitly states "No suspected malignity," the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
