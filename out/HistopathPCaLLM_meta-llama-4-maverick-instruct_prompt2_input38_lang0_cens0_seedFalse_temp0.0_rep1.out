To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, "Sampletype" should be "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "No suspected malignity." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not mention any malignancy or Gleason grades, and it explicitly states "No suspected malignity," the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
