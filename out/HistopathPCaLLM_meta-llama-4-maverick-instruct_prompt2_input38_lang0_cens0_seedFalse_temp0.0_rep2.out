To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative needle biopsies as samples." This indicates that the sample type is a biopsy, as needle biopsies are a form of biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "No suspected malignity." This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of malignancy or any details related to Gleason grades, and the statement explicitly says "No suspected malignity," it implies the Gleason grade is not applicable here, hence it should be "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement:

- The sample type is "biopsy".
- Malignancy is "no".
- Gleason grade is "NA".

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
