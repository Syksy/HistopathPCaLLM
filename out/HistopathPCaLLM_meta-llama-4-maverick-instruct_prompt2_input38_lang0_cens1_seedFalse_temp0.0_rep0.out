To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, the sample type should be considered as "NA" since it's not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the histological examination findings as "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy status should be considered as "no" since the statement explicitly describes a benign condition.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since the statement is describing a benign condition ("hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation"), it is appropriate to mark the Gleason grade as "NA" as Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tissues.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
