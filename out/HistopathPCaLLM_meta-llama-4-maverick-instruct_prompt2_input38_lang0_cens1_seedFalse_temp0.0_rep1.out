To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the histological examination findings as "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation." There is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy status should be considered as "no" since it explicitly describes a benign condition (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation).

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since the statement is describing a benign condition (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation) without any reference to malignancy or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
