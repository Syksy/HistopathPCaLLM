To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative samples are collected" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA" since the specific type is not mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes findings of "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not mention any malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be categorized as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
