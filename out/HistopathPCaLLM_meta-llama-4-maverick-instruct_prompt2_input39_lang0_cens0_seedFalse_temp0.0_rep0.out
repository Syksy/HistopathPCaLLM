To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation." Prostatectomy preparate refers to a specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor" and further discusses the characteristics of the tumor, such as the number of foci and the Gleason grade. The presence of a tumor indicates malignancy, so the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7." This directly translates to a Gleason score of "3+4=7". 

Therefore, structuring the information into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
