To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A prostatectomy preparate under investigation." Prostatectomy preparate refers to a specimen obtained after a radical prostatectomy (RP), which is the surgical removal of the prostate gland. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Microscopic sections reveal a tumor" and further discusses the characteristics of the tumor, such as the number of foci and the marginal status. The presence of a tumor indicates malignancy, so the answer to whether there were malignant tumor findings is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason grades as "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages" and concludes that "Gleason grade is 7." This implies the Gleason score is calculated as 3+4=7. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
