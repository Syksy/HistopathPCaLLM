To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample under examination" but does not explicitly state the type of sample. It does not directly indicate if it's a "biopsy", "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since the specific type is not mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of "benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." This implies that it is not clear whether there are malignant tumor findings. Since it cannot be confirmed as malignant or benign, the appropriate value would be "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information (or lack thereof) provided in the histopathological statement according to the required structure and allowed values.
