To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample under examination" but does not specify the type directly. However, it talks about "Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine" and "Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations." The sample type isn't directly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, we have to consider it as "NA" since the specific type isn't clear from the given information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy with the phrase "it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings." Since it cannot be confirmed whether the findings are malignant or not, the appropriate answer is "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says, "Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point." Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the given histopathological statement.
