To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings." This terminology is commonly associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which is a procedure where prostate tissue is removed in the form of chippings or fragments. Therefore, the sample type is "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
