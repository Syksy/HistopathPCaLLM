To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings." This terminology is most closely associated with a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the specified requirements, providing the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
