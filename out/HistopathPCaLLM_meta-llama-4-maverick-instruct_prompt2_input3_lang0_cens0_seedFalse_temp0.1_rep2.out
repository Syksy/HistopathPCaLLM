To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings." This terminology is most closely associated with "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings or fragments.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy found, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "TURP" because the sample consists of prostate chippings, which is typical for TURP procedures.
- **Malignancy**: "no" as there's no indication of malignancy.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because the sample is benign.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
