To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The key here is understanding what kind of sample is being referred to. The mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" and it being done in a "single run" could imply a significant amount of tissue, which is more characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or possibly an RP (Radical Prostatectomy). However, the context suggests a TURP is more likely due to the mention of a "single run," which is a term often associated with TURP procedures. Therefore, the sample type could be considered as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignancy or cancer; instead, it mentions inflammation and the inability to make a conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts. Therefore, the malignancy status is not determinable or "NA" because the statement does not conclusively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy and is inconclusive due to artefacts, the Gleason grade is not provided. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the instructions by providing a flat structure with the required fields and using the allowed values. The sample type is identified as "TURP" based on the context, and both malignancy and Gleason grade are marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding malignancy.
