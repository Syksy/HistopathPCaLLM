To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The large quantity of prostate material suggests it is not a biopsy. The fact that it's done in a "single run" could imply TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), which typically involves removing a larger amount of tissue compared to a biopsy. However, the exact procedure isn't directly stated. Given the context, "TURP" seems a plausible sample type due to the quantity of material, but it's not explicitly mentioned. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy" or "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), as RP typically involves examining the entire prostate gland and surrounding tissues after surgical removal, and the description doesn't fit well with a biopsy due to the large amount of tissue. Since it's not explicitly clear and doesn't directly fit the most common descriptions, one might lean towards "TURP" due to the procedural hint ("done in a single run"), but the description is not definitive.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear indication of malignancy; in fact, it suggests that due to artefacts and lack of detailed examination, no conclusive diagnosis (including malignancy) can be made. Therefore, it leans towards "NA" because the presence or absence of malignancy isn't conclusively determined.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy and detailed examination was prevented by artefacts, the Gleason grade is not provided or determinable. Thus, it should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "TURP" is chosen here based on the procedural hint and quantity of tissue, the statement doesn't directly confirm it. A more conservative interpretation without making assumptions beyond the given text could suggest "Sampletype" as "NA" if the type isn't clearly identifiable.

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This latter interpretation aligns more closely with the caution against making assumptions not directly supported by the text. Therefore, the most appropriate structured data, given the ambiguity and lack of clear information on the sample type, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
