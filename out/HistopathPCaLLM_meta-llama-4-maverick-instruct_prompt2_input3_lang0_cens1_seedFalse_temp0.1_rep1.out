To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The key here is understanding what kind of sample is being referred to. The mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" and it being done in a "single run" could imply a significant amount of tissue, which is more characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. However, the exact nature (TURP, RP, biopsy) isn't directly stated. Given the context, it seems more likely to be TURP due to the quantity of material, but it's not a clear indication. Therefore, based on the information provided and the allowed values, we might lean towards "TURP" as a possible sample type due to the quantity of tissue, but it's not a definitive identification.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignant findings; in fact, it suggests that due to artefacts, a detailed examination was not possible. This implies that there wasn't a conclusive diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, we should consider "Malignancy" as "NA" because the statement doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy conclusively.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts and no mention of Gleason grades, the "Gleason" field should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "TURP" is chosen here based on the quantity of tissue, it's not a perfectly clear-cut decision without more specific procedural context. If one were to strictly interpret the lack of clear sample type identification, "NA" could also be considered for "Sampletype". But based on the given instructions and trying to make an educated guess:

The final answer is:
```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
