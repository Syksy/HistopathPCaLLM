To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." The key here is understanding what kind of sample is being referred to. The mention of "over a dozen grams of prostate material" and it being done in a "single run" could imply a significant amount of tissue, which is more characteristic of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure rather than a biopsy. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't directly stated. Given the context, it seems more likely to be TURP due to the quantity of material, but it's not a clear indication. Therefore, based on the information given and the allowed values, we might lean towards "TURP" as a possible sample type due to the quantity of tissue, but it's not a definitive identification.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run." There's no clear mention of malignant findings; instead, it highlights the inability to make a conclusive diagnosis due to artefacts. Therefore, we cannot definitively say "yes" to malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy but also an inability to rule it out conclusively due to the artefacts, and given that there's no explicit statement of benignity or malignancy, the most appropriate answer based on the information provided would be "NA" as we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement doesn't discuss the Gleason score or grades, which are relevant for malignant prostate tissue. Since there's no mention of malignancy being identified and thus no Gleason score being provided, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade is "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "TURP" is chosen here based on the quantity of tissue, it's not a perfectly clear-cut decision without more specific procedural context. If one were to strictly interpret the lack of clear sample type identification, "NA" could also be considered for "Sampletype". But based on the provided context and leaning towards a reasonable inference:

The final answer is:
```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
