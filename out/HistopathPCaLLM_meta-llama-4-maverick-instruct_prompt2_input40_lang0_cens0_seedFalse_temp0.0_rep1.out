To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving material" which is not directly one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). However, "shaving material" can be interpreted as related to "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve removal of prostate tissue. Since "shaving" isn't a standard term for the sample types listed, and given that TURP is a procedure that involves removing shavings of prostate tissue, we might consider it as "TURP". However, without a clear indication that it's TURP, and given the context that it's not explicitly mentioned, a more cautious approach would be to consider it as not directly matching the given categories, thus potentially categorizing it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information. But, based on the context, it seems reasonable to consider it as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia". This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" should be "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign ("Benign prostate hyperplasia"), there's no Gleason grade mentioned or applicable. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, if we were to strictly interpret "shaving material" without associating it with TURP, the Sampletype could be considered "NA" due to the lack of a direct match:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

For the purpose of this task and based on the context provided, the first interpretation seems more appropriate, assuming "shaving material" is related to a procedure like TURP. Thus, the preferred structured answer is:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
