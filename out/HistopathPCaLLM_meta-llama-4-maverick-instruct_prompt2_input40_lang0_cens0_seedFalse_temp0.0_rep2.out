To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving material" which is not directly one of the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). However, "shaving material" can be interpreted as related to "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as both involve removal of prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type can be considered as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia". This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy should be marked as "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that the findings are benign and there's no mention of Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
