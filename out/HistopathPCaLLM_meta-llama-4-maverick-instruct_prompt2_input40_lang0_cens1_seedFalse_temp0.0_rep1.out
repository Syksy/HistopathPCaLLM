To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examined material weights 8.9, approx 8 casettes are used." This indicates that some material was examined, but it doesn't directly state the type of sample. However, the context (weight and number of cassettes) could imply a significant sample. The terms "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are not directly mentioned. Given the lack of specific information about the sample type, we should consider it as "NA" because we cannot conclusively determine the sample type from the information provided.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "Histological examination reveals at least hyperplastic prostate and ...... At least inflammation, but possibly something else." It mentions hyperplasia and inflammation but does not confirm malignancy. The phrase "but possibly something else" is vague and does not directly indicate malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, we should consider this as "NA" or potentially "no" if we had to choose between "yes" and "no" based on the lack of confirmation. However, given the ambiguity and the instruction to be cautious, "NA" seems more appropriate due to the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" since Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate cancer, and there's no clear indication of malignancy here.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement does not provide clear information about the sample type, does not confirm malignancy, and does not mention Gleason grades.
