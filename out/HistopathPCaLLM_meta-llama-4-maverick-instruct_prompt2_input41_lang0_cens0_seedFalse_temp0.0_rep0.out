To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to the sample type being "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy should be marked as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of prostate cancer (malignancy is "no"), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy"
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason**: "NA"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
