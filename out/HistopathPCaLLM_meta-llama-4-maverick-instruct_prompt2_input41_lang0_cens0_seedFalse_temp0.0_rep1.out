To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to the sample type being "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy should be marked as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of prostate cancer (malignancy is "no"), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the specified requirements, providing the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
