To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies," which directly corresponds to one of the allowed values for the sample type, which is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy should be marked as "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes that there are "No signs of prostate cancer in the material," it implies a benign condition. For benign statements, the Gleason grade is considered "NA."

Putting it all together:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" because the statement refers to biopsies.
- **Malignancy**: "no" because it explicitly states there are no signs of prostate cancer.
- **Gleason**: "NA" because there's no malignancy found.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
