To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes, it is likely referring to a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly mentioned, and considering the allowed values, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, based on the information given and the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy" due to the mention of "samples" which is common in biopsy reports.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there are findings of "little chronic inflammation" and "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation." It also mentions that it's "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This implies that there is no clear evidence of malignancy, so the malignancy status is not confirmed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "no" because it doesn't confirm the presence of cancer.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structuring is based on the information provided and the context clues within the statement.
