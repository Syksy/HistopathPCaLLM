To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes, it is likely referring to a biopsy. But since it's not explicitly mentioned and could be interpreted in different ways, we should be cautious. The most appropriate answer based on the information given and the allowed values would be "biopsy" if we consider the sampling as indicative of a biopsy procedure. However, without explicit mention, one might argue it could be "NA" due to lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there are findings of chronic inflammation and atrophied glands but concludes with "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This implies that there is no clear evidence of malignancy, but it is also not definitively ruled out. The closest interpretation based on the allowed values is "NA" because the statement does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be "NA".

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that a more conservative interpretation without assuming the sample type could result in:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Both interpretations have their rationale based on the information provided in the statement. The first assumes a biopsy based on the context, while the second is more cautious and sticks to "NA" when the information is not explicitly clear. Given the task's constraints and focusing on the information directly provided or strongly implied, the first JSON is a reasonable representation.
