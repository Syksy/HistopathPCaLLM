To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that samples are collected from lobes, it is most likely referring to a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes findings such as "little chronic inflammation" and "atrophied glands and chronic inflammation" but concludes with "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." This indicates uncertainty regarding malignancy. Since there's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and it does not categorically state the presence or absence of cancer, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the ambiguity.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy and no Gleason grade is provided, it should be marked as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format based on the provided guidelines:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate structured data based on the information given in the histopathological statement.
