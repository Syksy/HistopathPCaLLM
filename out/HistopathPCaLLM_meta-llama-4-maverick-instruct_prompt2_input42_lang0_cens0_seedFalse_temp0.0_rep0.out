To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which refers to a prostatectomy specimen. The abbreviation for prostatectomy is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). So, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the presence of Gleason grades, which are a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness. The mention of Gleason grades indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason score as 7 with the major and minor grades being 4 and 3, respectively. It is reported as "4+3" resulting in a sum of "7". So, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
