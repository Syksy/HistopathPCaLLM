To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" because it's not explicitly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty about the presence of cancer, and it hasn't been confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. The most appropriate answer would be "NA" because the presence of malignancy is not definitively stated.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of cancer and does not provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
