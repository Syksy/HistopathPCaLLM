To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions a "Prostate sample" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it should be considered as "NA".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined." This implies that there is uncertainty about the presence of cancer, and it is not explicitly confirmed. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy. Since it's not clearly stated as malignant or benign, the malignancy status should be considered "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grades. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the presence of cancer is uncertain, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
