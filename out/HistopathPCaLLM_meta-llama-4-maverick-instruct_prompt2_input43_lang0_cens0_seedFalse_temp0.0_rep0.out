To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and that "Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." This context suggests that the sample is from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) because it involves prostate chippings, which is typical for TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy (adenocarcinoma), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements:
- It reflects the most severe lesion (or the lack thereof),
- It is not nested,
- It uses the allowed values for each field.
