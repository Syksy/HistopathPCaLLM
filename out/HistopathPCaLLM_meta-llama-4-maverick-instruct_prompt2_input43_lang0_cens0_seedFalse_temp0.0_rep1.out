To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples." This terminology is typically associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chippings.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy detected, the Gleason grade is not applicable.

Based on the above analysis:

- The sample type is "TURP" because the tissue was obtained in the form of chippings.
- Malignancy is "no" since there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma.
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the sample is benign.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
