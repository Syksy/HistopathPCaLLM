To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and that "Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." This context suggests that the sample is from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) because it involves prostate chippings, which is typical for TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." This means there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy (adenocarcinoma), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP" because the sample is described as "prostate chippings."
- **Malignancy**: "no" because there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" because the sample is benign.

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
