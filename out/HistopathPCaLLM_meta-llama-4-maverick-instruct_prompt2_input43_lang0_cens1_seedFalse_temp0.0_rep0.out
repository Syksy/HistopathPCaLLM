To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar," which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight of the sample (approx 30g) is also more typical of a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a TURP specimen. However, the description doesn't directly indicate the sample type. Given the context, it seems more likely to be related to a surgical specimen, but without clear indication, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't directly support "biopsy." Since it's not explicitly mentioned and the context is not clear enough to definitively categorize it as "RP" or "TURP," we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there were no clear malignant findings or the sample was not conclusive for malignancy. It doesn't directly state "no malignancy," so we should be careful. The statement indicates that the tissue seen was "mostly ordinary prostate tissue" with "isolated atrophied glands visible," but it doesn't confirm malignancy. Thus, we can infer that there were no clear malignant tumor findings reported. Therefore, "Malignancy" could be considered as "no" because it doesn't confirm cancerous changes.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of Gleason grades or any indication of malignancy, the "Gleason" field should be "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" (because the specific type isn't clearly mentioned)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (as there's no confirmation of cancerous changes)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no malignancy reported or Gleason grade mentioned)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
