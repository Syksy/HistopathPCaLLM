To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar," which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The weight of the sample (approx 30g) is also more typical of a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a TURP specimen than a biopsy. However, without explicit mention, we can't be certain. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, and RP is plausible due to the quantity of tissue. However, the description doesn't directly support TURP or RP conclusively without more context on how the material is processed or described. Therefore, based on the information given and the typical context, we might lean towards "RP" due to the quantity of tissue, but it's not a clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there was no clear evidence of malignancy found, but it doesn't conclusively state that the sample is benign either. It suggests an inconclusive result regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no clear evidence or mention of cancerous changes or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is not applicable or reported.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The most likely sample type is not clearly identified, so it should be considered as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The statement implies that no conclusive evidence of malignancy was found, but it doesn't directly state the sample is benign. It suggests an inability to determine malignancy, so "NA" or "no" could be considered. "NA" seems more appropriate due to the inconclusive nature.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no malignancy identified or Gleason grades mentioned, it should be "NA".

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the lack of clear information regarding the sample type, the inconclusive nature of the malignancy assessment, and the absence of Gleason grading.
