To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar," which is more indicative of a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. Yet, without explicit mention, we can't be certain. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, we will consider it as "NA" due to the lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there were no clear malignant findings or the sample was not conclusive for malignancy. It doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy. Thus, we will consider it as "NA" because it doesn't confirm or deny malignancy clearly.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of Gleason grades or any indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is considered "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format as per the requirements:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
