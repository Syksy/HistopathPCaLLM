To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies," which directly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the tissue as "normally structured prostate tissue" with "little chronic inflammation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious." It also mentions that "now no tumor tissue can be seen," indicating there are no malignant tumor findings in the current sample. Although it references earlier biopsies showing prostate cancer, the question pertains to the current sample.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignant tumor findings in the current sample, and the statement doesn't provide any Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information derived from the histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
