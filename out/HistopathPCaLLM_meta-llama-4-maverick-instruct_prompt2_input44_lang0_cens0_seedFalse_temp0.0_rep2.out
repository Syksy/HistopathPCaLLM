To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies," which directly indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the tissue as "normally structured prostate tissue" with observations of "little chronic inflammation and in some places atrophy" and concludes with "Nothing suspicious." It also mentions that "earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." This indicates there are no malignant tumor findings in the current sample.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings in the current sample, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA."

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information extracted from the histopathological statement according to the required structure and allowed values.
