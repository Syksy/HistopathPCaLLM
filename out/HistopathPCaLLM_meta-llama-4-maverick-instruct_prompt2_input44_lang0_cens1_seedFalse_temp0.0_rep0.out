To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that it refers to "earlier biopsies," it implies the current sample is likely from a biopsy as well. However, the text does not directly confirm the sample type as "biopsy." Since it's not explicitly mentioned and could be inferred in different ways, we'll have to consider the information given and the allowed values. The statement doesn't directly say "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," so we might lean towards "NA" if we were strictly interpreting. However, the context suggests a biopsy.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not provide conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it does not rule out malignancy either. It also references "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. However, the question is about the current sample's malignancy status. Since it cannot be concluded, the most appropriate answer is "NA" for the current sample's malignancy status because it doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for the current sample, as it doesn't report malignant changes. It references earlier biopsies that reported prostate cancer, implying a Gleason grade was or could have been reported then, but not for the current sample. Thus, the Gleason grade for the current sample is "NA."

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement doesn't directly state the sample type, doesn't conclude on malignancy for the current sample, and doesn't provide a Gleason grade. While there's a mention of earlier biopsies and prostate cancer history, the current sample's details are not conclusive for malignancy or Gleason grading.
