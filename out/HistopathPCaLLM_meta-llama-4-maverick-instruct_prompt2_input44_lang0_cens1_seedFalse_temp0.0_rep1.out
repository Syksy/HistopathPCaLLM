To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to "earlier biopsies," indicating that the current sample is likely also a biopsy. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not provide conclusive evidence of malignancy. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the current sample, since it doesn't conclusively show malignancy, the malignancy status should be considered as "no" because it directly states that "normally structured prostate tissue" was seen and there's no mention of cancer in the current sample.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for the current sample. It mentions earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer but does not give the Gleason grade for those or the current sample. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be considered as "NA" because there's no information about the Gleason grade in the current sample.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most accurate interpretation of the given histopathological statement based on the provided guidelines.
