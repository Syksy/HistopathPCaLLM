To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Representative prostate samples according to standard routine." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), but given the context that it refers to "earlier biopsies," it is reasonable to infer that the current sample is also a "biopsy." Therefore, the sample type is likely "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes." This indicates that the current sample does not provide conclusive evidence of malignancy, but it does not rule out malignancy either. However, it mentions "earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer," indicating a history of malignancy. For the current sample, since it cannot be concluded that there are malignant changes, the malignancy status is effectively "no" because it doesn't show clear evidence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade for the current sample, as it does not report malignant changes. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information derived from the histopathological statement according to the specified requirements.
