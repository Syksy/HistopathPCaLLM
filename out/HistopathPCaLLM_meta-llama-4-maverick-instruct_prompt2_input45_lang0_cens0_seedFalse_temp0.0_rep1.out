To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." The term "whole prostatectomy" is synonymous with "Radical Prostatectomy" (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "tissue gleason 3," which implies the presence of a malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades as "3+4" and also mentions "tissue gleason 3." The presence of "3+4" indicates a Gleason score where the major grade is 3, the minor grade is 4, and the sum is 7. Although it later mentions "tissue gleason 3," this seems to refer to a component of the Gleason grading rather than the overall score. The most severe lesion is described with Gleason grades "3+4=7."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
