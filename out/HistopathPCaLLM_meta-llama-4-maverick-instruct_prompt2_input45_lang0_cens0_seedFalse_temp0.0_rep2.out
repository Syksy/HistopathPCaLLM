To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample." The term "whole prostatectomy preparate" is synonymous with "Radical Prostatectomy" (RP), which is one of the allowed values for the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates the presence of a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "tissue gleason 3," which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason grades as "3+4" and also mentions "tissue gleason 3." The presence of "3+4" indicates a Gleason score where the major grade is 3, the minor grade is 4, and the sum is 7. Although it also mentions "tissue gleason 3," this seems to be referring to one of the components of the Gleason grading rather than a complete Gleason score. The most relevant and complete Gleason information given is "3+4," which sums up to 7.

Therefore, based on the given statement:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy)
- **Malignancy**: "yes"
- **Gleason Grade**: "3+4=7"

The structured data in valid JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
