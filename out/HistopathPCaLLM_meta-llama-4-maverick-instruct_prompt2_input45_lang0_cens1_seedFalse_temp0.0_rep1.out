To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions a "prostate sample" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it mentions "sample material from the middle" and "seminal vesicles in sections O and P are clean," it suggests a surgical specimen. The term "prostate sample" could imply a biopsy, but the detailed description (e.g., seminal vesicles being examined) might also suggest a more extensive surgical specimen like a radical prostatectomy (RP). However, the text does not directly confirm it as RP or another type. Since it's not explicitly mentioned and doesn't directly fit into the more specific categories based on the given information, and considering the context of the statement, it seems to be more aligned with a "biopsy" due to the mention of "sample material" being examined in detail. However, the exact nature (biopsy, RP, TURP) isn't clearly stated, so a definitive classification based on the given text is challenging.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm the presence of malignancy. It describes a "fusing tissue focus" with gland structures and canals being separated, which could be suggestive of a pathological process. However, it explicitly states that the "structure is unclear and not able to detect" and that "further inspection is needed." There's no clear indication of malignancy being identified. Thus, based on the information given, it seems that malignancy is not confirmed.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The Gleason grading system is used for prostate cancer, and its application is not mentioned in the statement. The lack of a clear diagnosis of malignancy and the absence of specific Gleason grades or scores imply that the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given these observations:

- **Sample type**: The statement doesn't clearly indicate the sample type. While it could be inferred as a biopsy due to the detailed examination of a sample, it's not definitive. Thus, it might be more appropriate to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.
- **Malignancy**: The presence of malignancy is not confirmed; hence, it should be considered as "no" or "NA" based on the interpretation that the statement doesn't clearly state the presence of malignancy. Since "further inspection is needed," it leans more towards "NA" as the malignancy status isn't definitively stated.
- **Gleason grade**: Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason grade is provided, it should be "NA."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given statement, is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
