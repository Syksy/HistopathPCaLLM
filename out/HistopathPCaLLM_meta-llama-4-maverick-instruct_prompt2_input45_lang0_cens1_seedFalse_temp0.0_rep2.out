To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "A suspect prostate sample" but does not directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it mentions "sample material from the middle" and "seminal vesicles in sections O and P are clean," it suggests a surgical specimen rather than a biopsy. The mention of specific sections (E, F, G, O, P) and the description of the sample's handling and examination could imply a more substantial sample than a typical biopsy. However, without explicit mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the level of detail about the sample's examination, it's not straightforward to determine the sample type directly from the statement. The statement does not clearly indicate it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "suspect prostate sample" and mentions that the "structure is unclear and not able to detect." It does not directly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The phrase "suspect prostate sample" implies a suspicion of malignancy or abnormality, but it does not conclusively state that malignancy was found. The statement concludes with "Further inspection is needed," indicating uncertainty or lack of a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, we cannot conclusively say "yes" to malignancy, so it should be categorized as "NA" due to the lack of a clear diagnosis.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It discusses the sample's characteristics and the inability to detect the structure clearly, necessitating further inspection. Since there's no mention of Gleason grades, it should be categorized as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of clear information regarding the sample type, the presence of malignancy, and the Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
