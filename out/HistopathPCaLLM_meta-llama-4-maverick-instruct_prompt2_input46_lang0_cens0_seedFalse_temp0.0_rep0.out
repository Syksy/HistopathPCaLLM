To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings." This description is most closely related to a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as it involves chippings of prostate tissue, which is typical for TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of prostate cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Hence, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement.
