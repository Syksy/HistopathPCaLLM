To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings," which is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as this is a common description for the type of sample obtained through TURP.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." Therefore, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy (prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable, and thus it should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON object adheres to the specified requirements, providing the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
