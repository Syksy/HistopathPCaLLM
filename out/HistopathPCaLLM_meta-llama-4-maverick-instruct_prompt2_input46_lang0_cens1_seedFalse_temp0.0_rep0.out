To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate material" and that it was processed on cassettes, but it doesn't directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that a "smaller portion of material was run" and it was examined microscopically, it suggests a biopsy. But the statement doesn't explicitly state it's a biopsy, and terms like "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are not mentioned. Since it's not explicitly stated and doesn't clearly fit into "RP" or "TURP" based on the description, and considering the ambiguity, the most appropriate answer based on the given information would be "NA" because it doesn't directly state the sample type.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined. Therefore, the answer should be "NA" as it is not definitively stated as "yes" or "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of cancer ("Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"), and Gleason grading is applicable to malignant tumors, the Gleason grade is "NA".

Therefore, based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
