To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the "Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run," which is more indicative of a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as both involve sampling tissue. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves examining the entire prostate gland. The description doesn't clearly fit RP due to the mention of "total size around 2x" and "smaller portion of material was run," suggesting a sampling rather than an examination of the whole gland. However, without explicit mention, it's challenging to definitively categorize it as biopsy or TURP based on the given text. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy or TURP, so we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of clear indication.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy. Since it doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy, we'll categorize it as "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement doesn't mention Gleason grades or scores. Gleason grading is used for malignant prostate tumors. Since there's no confirmation of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, we'll categorize it as "NA".

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
