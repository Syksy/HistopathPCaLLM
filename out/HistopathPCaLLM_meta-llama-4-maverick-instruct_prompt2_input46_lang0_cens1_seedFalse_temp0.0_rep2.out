To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Prostate material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it mentions that the "Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run," which is more indicative of a biopsy or possibly a TURP, as both involve sampling tissue. Radical Prostatectomy (RP) typically involves examining the entire prostate gland. The description doesn't clearly indicate RP, and the term "material" is somewhat ambiguous but leans more towards a sampling procedure. However, without a clear indication, and given the ambiguity, the safest categorization based on the information provided would be "NA" because it doesn't directly state "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not." This implies that the presence or absence of malignancy couldn't be determined, so it can't be definitively classified as "yes" or "no." Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement doesn't confirm the presence of cancer ("Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not"), and Gleason grading is applicable to malignant tumors, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, based on the given statement, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
