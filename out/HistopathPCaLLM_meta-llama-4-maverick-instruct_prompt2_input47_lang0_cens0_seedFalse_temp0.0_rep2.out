To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly states, "No malign findings on the left or the right." This means there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malign findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
