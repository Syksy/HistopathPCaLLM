To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatic material" but does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that there is "normal prostate epithelium" and mentions "chronic inflammation" but explicitly states that it is "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that the presence of malignancy could not be confirmed or denied. Therefore, the most appropriate answer for malignancy is "NA" because the statement does not conclusively indicate the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or any related information. Since there's no mention of malignancy being present or Gleason grades, it is appropriate to consider this field as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the provided instructions and the example given for a statement that is not a valid histopathological statement for malignancy or does not contain the required information.
