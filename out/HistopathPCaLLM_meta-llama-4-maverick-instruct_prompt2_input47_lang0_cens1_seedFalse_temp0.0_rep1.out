To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatic material" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to material from both the right and left, suggesting it could be from a surgical procedure or biopsy. The term "prostatic material" is broad and could relate to several sample types, but without specific mention of "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the context, it's not straightforward to determine the exact sample type. Therefore, we will categorize it as "NA" due to lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that it is "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that the presence of malignancy could not be confirmed or denied, so the most appropriate answer is "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement does not confirm the presence of malignancy, and there's no mention of Gleason grades, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Therefore, structuring the given statement into JSON format as per the requirements:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
