To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatic material" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that it discusses examining material from the right and left and mentions a total amount of prostatic material, it is likely referring to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since this procedure involves removing prostate tissue. However, the statement doesn't directly confirm it, and without explicit mention, we should be cautious. The sample type isn't clearly identified as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP." Therefore, we'll have to consider it as "NA" due to the lack of clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement discusses examining prostate material and mentions "normal prostate epithelium" and "chronic inflammation" but concludes with "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This indicates uncertainty regarding the presence of malignancy. Since it doesn't confirm the presence or absence of malignancy clearly, we'll have to categorize it as "NA" due to the uncertainty.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Gleason grading is used for prostate cancer, and its absence, combined with the uncertainty about malignancy, suggests that the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the uncertainty and lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
