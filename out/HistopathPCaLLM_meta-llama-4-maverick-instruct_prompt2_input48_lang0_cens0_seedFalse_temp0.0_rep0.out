To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." and describes the preparation of the sample with various parts of the prostate and seminal vesicles being examined. The term "prostate resection" typically refers to a surgical removal of part or all of the prostate gland. Given the context, "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) is a likely interpretation because it involves examining various parts of the prostate and seminal vesicles, which is consistent with a resection specimen rather than a biopsy or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) in the prostate. It mentions "Histologically found adenocarcinoma in two first basis macro sections." Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason grade 5 is predominant (>80%) with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The Gleason score is typically represented as the sum of the two most prevalent grades. The most severe lesion is implied to have a Gleason score of 9, likely derived from the second focus with a predominant Gleason 5 and a secondary Gleason 4, making the score 5+4=9. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
