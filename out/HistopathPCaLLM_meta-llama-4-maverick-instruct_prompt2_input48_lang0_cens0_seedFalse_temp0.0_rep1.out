To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." and describes the preparation of the sample with various parts of the prostate and seminal vesicles being examined. The term "prostate resection" typically refers to a surgical removal of part or all of the prostate gland. Given the context, this is most likely referring to a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), as it involves examining various parts of the prostate and seminal vesicles, which is a more extensive examination than what is typically done with a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or a "biopsy". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) in the prostate. It mentions "Histologically found adenocarcinoma in two first basis macro sections." Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. For the first focus, the most common Gleason grade is 4, and the next most common is 3. For the second focus, Gleason grade 5 is predominant (>80%) with a smaller portion being Gleason 4. The summary states "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." Since the task is to report the Gleason grade for the most severe lesion and given that the second focus has a higher Gleason score (5+4 or potentially 5+5 if we consider the predominant pattern), and the summary directly mentions "Gleason 9", it implies the most severe lesion has a Gleason score that sums up to 9. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
