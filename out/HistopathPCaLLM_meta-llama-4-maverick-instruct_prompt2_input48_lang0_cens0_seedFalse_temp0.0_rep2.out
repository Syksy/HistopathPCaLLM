To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate resection weighing 100g" and describes the preparation of the sample with various parts of the prostate and seminal vesicles being examined. The term "resection" in this context is most likely referring to a "Radical Prostatectomy" (RP) since it involves a detailed examination of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of "adenocarcinoma" in the prostate, which is a type of malignant tumor. Thus, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades found in the tumor foci. It mentions two tumor foci with different Gleason patterns and concludes with a summary stating "Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." The most severe lesion is described with Gleason 5 (>80%) and a smaller portion of Gleason 4. The sum of Gleason grades for this lesion is 5 + 4 = 9, which matches the summary. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "5+4=9".

Given the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the information based on the most severe lesion described in the histopathological statement.
