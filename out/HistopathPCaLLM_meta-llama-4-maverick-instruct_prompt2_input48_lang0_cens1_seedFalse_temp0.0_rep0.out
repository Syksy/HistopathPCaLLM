To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The term "autopsies" is not directly listed among the allowed values for "Sampletype" (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). Since "autopsies" doesn't match any of the given categories directly and is not a standard sample type for diagnostic pathology reports in the context provided, it is most appropriate to categorize it as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't directly mention the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. It refers to "some exemplifying histological changes" but doesn't specify if these changes are malignant. It also mentions that the demonstration is "not used to derive differentiation scores," which implies that the focus or the outcome might not be directly related to assessing malignancy or Gleason grading. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy, so it should be categorized as "NA".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that the samples are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)," indicating that a Gleason grade was not assessed or reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be categorized as "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
