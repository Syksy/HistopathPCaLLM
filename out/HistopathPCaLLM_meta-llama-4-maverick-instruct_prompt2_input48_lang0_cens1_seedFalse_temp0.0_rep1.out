To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The term "autopsies" is not directly listed among the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsies" doesn't match any of the given categories directly and is not a standard sample type for diagnostic purposes in the context provided, it is most appropriate to categorize it as "NA" because it doesn't fit the clinical context of the allowed sample types.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe" but does not explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. It also mentions that the nature of the demonstration is not used to derive differentiation scores, implying that the sample is not being used for a diagnostic purpose that would typically involve assessing malignancy. However, it doesn't directly state that the findings are benign or malignant. Given the context, it seems the focus is not on diagnosing malignancy, so we might lean towards "NA" due to the lack of a clear statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly says "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)," indicating that a Gleason score is not applicable or provided. Thus, it should be categorized as "NA".

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" because the sample is from autopsies, which doesn't fit the given categories.
- **Malignancy**: "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication of malignancy or benignity in the context of diagnostic evaluation.
- **Gleason**: "NA" as the statement explicitly indicates that Gleason scores are not derived.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
