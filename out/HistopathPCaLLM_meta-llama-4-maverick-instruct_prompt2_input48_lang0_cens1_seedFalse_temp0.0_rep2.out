To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." The term "autopsies" does not directly correspond to any of the allowed values for sample type ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). Since "autopsies" is not listed among the allowed values, we should categorize it as "NA" because it doesn't fit into the specified categories.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe" but does not explicitly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. It also mentions that the nature of the demonstration is not used to derive differentiation scores, implying that the sample is not being used for a clinical diagnosis of malignancy. However, it doesn't directly state that the findings are benign or malignant. The lack of explicit mention of malignancy and the context suggesting an educational purpose rather than a diagnostic one leads us to be cautious. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and given the educational context, we might lean towards "NA" for malignancy due to the absence of a clear statement regarding the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement explicitly mentions that due to the nature of the demonstration, the samples are "not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." This implies that a Gleason score is not provided or applicable in this context. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be categorized as "NA".

Based on the above analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the inability to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade from the given statement according to the allowed values and the context provided.
