To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings on 8 glasses." This context suggests a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) since it involves examining prostate tissue shavings, which is typical for TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy is "yes."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides the Gleason classes, stating that the "most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (as there's only one lesion described) and providing the structured data in a non-nested JSON format.
