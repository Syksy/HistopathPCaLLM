Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is that the statement does not provide clear information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. The statement mentions that some changes warrant further investigation, but it does not confirm the presence of malignancy or provide a Gleason grade. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" for all three fields.
