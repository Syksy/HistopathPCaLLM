Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is that the statement does not clearly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.), nor does it confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Additionally, there is no mention of Gleason grades. The statement mentions that some changes warrant further investigation, but it does not provide a clear diagnosis or relevant information for the required fields. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" for all three fields.
