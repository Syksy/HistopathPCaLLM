To structure the given statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the given instructions.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate samples on 8 glasses" and refers to a "fifth glass," which indicates it's discussing samples from a biopsy, as the term "glasses" is often used to refer to slides prepared from biopsy samples. However, it doesn't explicitly state "biopsy." Still, given the context, it's reasonable to infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy." The other options like "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) are less likely given the mention of "glasses" and the context of investigating samples. So, the sample type can be considered as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the "fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation." This implies that there are some abnormal findings, but it does not confirm malignancy. It states that assessing the findings further is not possible due to technical limitations, so a definitive diagnosis of malignancy is not made. Therefore, the malignancy status is not clearly "yes" or "no," making "NA" the most appropriate answer due to the lack of a definitive statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade or mention any details related to Gleason scoring. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade, and given that malignancy is not confirmed, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" (since it involves examining prostate samples on slides/glasses)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (because the statement doesn't confirm malignancy and indicates further investigation is needed)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no mention of Gleason grades or a confirmed malignancy)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
