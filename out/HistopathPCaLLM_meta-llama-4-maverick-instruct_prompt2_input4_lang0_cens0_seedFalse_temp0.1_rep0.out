To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies taken from standard locations." This indicates that the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly states that "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This means there are no malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
