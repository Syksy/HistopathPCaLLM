To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sampled tissue" and "sample material." However, it does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). The context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling sites" and "sampled tissue," but it's not definitive. Given the information, the most appropriate answer is "biopsy" because it's the most common type associated with sampling and assessing tissue representativeness. However, without explicit mention, this is an inference.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material "is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." The absence of atypic patterns and the specific mention of not being able to assess for adenocarcinoma (a type of cancer) due to insufficient material leans towards indicating no clear malignancy detected, but the assessment is not definitive due to the insufficiency of the sample. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the information given is "NA" because the statement does not conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no Gleason score is provided, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the information provided in the statement.
