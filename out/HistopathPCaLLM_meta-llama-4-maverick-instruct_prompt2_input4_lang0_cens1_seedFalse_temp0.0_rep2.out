To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sampled tissue" and "sample material." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling sites" and "sampled tissue." Despite this, the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and given the lack of clear indication towards "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," and considering the instructions, we should be cautious. The statement does not clearly fit into "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP," so we might consider it as "NA" due to lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue" and mentions that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies there's no clear evidence of malignancy ("adenocarcinoma") but also indicates the sample is not sufficient for a definitive assessment. However, based on the information given, it leans towards not having found malignancy but is not conclusive. The closest answer based on the given choices and the context would be "no" because it states "no notable atypic patterns are present," even though it's not definitive due to the sample being insufficient.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of Gleason grades and the statement indicates the sample is insufficient for assessing adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA."

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response is based on the information provided and the constraints of the allowed values for each field. The sample type is considered "NA" due to a lack of explicit information, malignancy is considered "no" based on the statement that "no notable atypic patterns are present," and Gleason grade is "NA" because there's no assessment of adenocarcinoma.
