To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and refers to "sampled tissue" and "sample material." However, it does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). The context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling sites" and "sampled tissue," but it's not definitive. Given the information, the most appropriate answer is "biopsy" because it's the most common type associated with "sampling sites" and the description doesn't clearly indicate a radical prostatectomy (RP) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). However, since it's not explicitly stated, one might argue it should be "NA" for not having a clear indication. For the purpose of this task and based on the context provided, we'll consider it as "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This implies there's no clear evidence of malignancy, but it also wasn't possible to definitively rule it out due to insufficient material. The closest interpretation is "no" for malignancy findings because it states "no notable atypic patterns are present," suggesting no clear evidence of malignancy was observed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no evidence of adenocarcinoma and the material is insufficient for a reliable assessment, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Thus, it should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "biopsy" (due to the context suggesting sampling, though not explicitly stated)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (as there's no notable atypic patterns)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no adenocarcinoma identified and insufficient material for a reliable assessment)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
