To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and later refers to "the sampled tissue appears representative of prostate tissue." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, the context suggests it is likely a biopsy due to the mention of "sampling sites" and "sampled tissue." Despite this inference, the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so we should be cautious. Given the information is not directly stated, we should consider it as "NA" because we cannot be certain.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says, "While no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue, the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." This indicates that there are no notable atypic patterns (suggesting no clear malignancy detected), but it also states the sample is insufficient for a reliable assessment of adenocarcinoma. However, the presence of malignancy is directly related to the detection of adenocarcinoma or other malignant features. Since it mentions "no notable atypic patterns are present," it leans towards not having detected malignancy, but the insufficiency for a reliable assessment complicates this. Still, based on the information given, we can infer "no" for malignancy findings because it directly states no atypic patterns were observed.

3. **Gleason grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade information. It mentions the sample is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, and there's no mention of Gleason grades. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" because there's no malignancy confirmed or Gleason grade provided.

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "NA" (because the specific type of sample is not explicitly mentioned)
- **Malignancy**: "no" (since no atypic patterns were noted, despite the sample being insufficient for a definitive assessment)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (since there's no confirmed malignancy and hence no Gleason grade provided)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
