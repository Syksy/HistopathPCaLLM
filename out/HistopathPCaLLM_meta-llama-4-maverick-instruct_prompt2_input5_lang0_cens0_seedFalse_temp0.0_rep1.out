To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy." Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement says "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)." This indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement provides Gleason scores for two different macroblocks:
   - Macro A has a Gleason score of "4+3" with a sum that can be calculated as 7.
   - Macro B has a higher sum (9) with a Gleason score of "4+5".
   
   Since Macro B has a higher Gleason sum (9), it represents the more severe lesion. Therefore, the Gleason grade to be reported is "4+5=9".

Given the information and the instructions to report the results from the most severe lesion, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
