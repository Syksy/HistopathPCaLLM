To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed." It indicates a detailed examination of prostate samples but doesn't directly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context of detailed sectioning and processing, it is likely referring to a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen due to the mention of examining the apex and basis, and the processing of multiple sections. The exact term "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP" is not used, but based on the description, "RP" seems the most plausible.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." This indicates that there are no malignant findings in the examined samples, as it specifically states "clear prostate tissue." Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement notes that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This implies that either the sample is benign or the Gleason grading could not be determined. Since it's mentioned that the tissue is "clear" and there's no clear indication of malignancy, and given that Gleason grading is typically not applicable or reported for benign samples, the Gleason grade is considered "NA."

Therefore, based on the analysis:

- **Sample Type**: "RP" (as it's the most likely scenario given the detailed examination described)
- **Malignancy**: "no"
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA"

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
