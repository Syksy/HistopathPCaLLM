To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed." It indicates that the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the detailed processing and the fact that it's examining various parts of the prostate (apex and basis) with specific indexing (A to H) could suggest a more extensive sampling, which is more typical of a radical prostatectomy or a detailed biopsy. The term "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate" and the detailed examination across different sections might lean more towards a surgical specimen like RP rather than a simple biopsy. However, the text doesn't explicitly state it's an RP or TURP. Given the lack of explicit information, we should be cautious. The statement doesn't clearly indicate it's a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so we might consider it as "NA" due to insufficient direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." This indicates that there are no malignant findings in the examined samples, as it specifies "clear prostate tissue." Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement says, "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." Additionally, it mentions that "Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." This implies there's some suspicion or indication of malignancy or atypical features that warrant further inspection, but it doesn't provide a definitive Gleason score. Since the text explicitly states that clear prostate tissue is observed and doesn't confirm malignancy, and given that a Gleason score is typically assigned to malignant tumors, the Gleason grade should be considered "NA" because the sample is described as not having confirmed malignancy.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structuring is based on the information provided and the specific requirements for the output format. The sample type is considered "NA" due to a lack of explicit information, malignancy is "no" because the tissue is described as "clear prostate tissue," and Gleason grade is "NA" because there's no confirmed malignancy.
