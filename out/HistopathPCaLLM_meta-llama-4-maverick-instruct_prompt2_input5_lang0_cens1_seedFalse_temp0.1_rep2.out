To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "Sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed." It indicates that the sample is from a prostate, but it doesn't directly state whether it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, given the detailed description of processing samples from different parts of the prostate (apex and basis) and the fact that it's not explicitly mentioned as a biopsy or TURP, and considering the context of a "relatively enlargened prostate" and detailed pathological examination, one might infer it could be related to a surgical specimen. However, the text doesn't clearly indicate it's an RP. The lack of clear indication towards any specific type (biopsy, RP, TURP) and the ambiguity in the statement makes it challenging to definitively categorize the sample type based on the given information. Therefore, the sample type is considered "NA" due to insufficient clear information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." This indicates that there are no malignant findings in the examined samples, as it specifically states that "clear prostate tissue" is observed. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred." This implies that the tissue examined did not show clear evidence of malignancy to the extent that Gleason grading could be applied. It further mentions that "Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection," but it does not provide a definitive Gleason score. Since there's no clear malignancy identified and Gleason grading is not provided, the Gleason grade is considered "NA".

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation of the given histopathological statement according to the required structured fields.
