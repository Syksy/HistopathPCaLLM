To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and that they are "run via three tissue casettes." The sample type is not directly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, "shaving chips" is more indicative of a TURP procedure, as it involves removing prostate tissue in the form of chips. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no indication of malignant findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with findings suggestive of "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant tumor or Gleason grades, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
