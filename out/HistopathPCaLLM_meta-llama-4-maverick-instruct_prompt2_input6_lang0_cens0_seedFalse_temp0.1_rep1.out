To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes." This description is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample, as it involves shaving chips, which is a characteristic of TURP procedures.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the microscopic findings as "relatively normal prostate grandular structures" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no indication of malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with findings suggestive of "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
