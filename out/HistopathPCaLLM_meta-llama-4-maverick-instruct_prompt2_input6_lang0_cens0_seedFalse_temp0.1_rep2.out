To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and that they are "run via three tissue casettes." The sample type is not directly mentioned as "biopsy," "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, "shaving chips" is most closely related to "TURP" as both involve removal of prostate tissue, with "TURP" being a procedure where chips of prostate tissue are removed. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the prostate glandular structures as "relatively normal" and mentions "benign prostate hyperplasia." There is no indication of malignant findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is used to score prostate cancer based on the appearance of tumor tissue. Since the statement concludes with "benign prostate hyperplasia" and does not mention cancer or provide Gleason scores, the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, providing the structured data for the given histopathological statement.
