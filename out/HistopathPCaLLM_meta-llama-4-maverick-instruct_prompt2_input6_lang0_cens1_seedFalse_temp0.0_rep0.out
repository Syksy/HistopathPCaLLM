To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." The key term here is "operation material," which typically refers to a surgical specimen. The most likely sample type related to prostate cancer and involving an "operation" is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is also a surgical procedure, but the term "operation material" is more commonly associated with RP. Biopsy is not an operation but a sampling procedure. Therefore, the sample type is likely "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes observing "relatively normal prostate tissue structures" but also mentions that the majority of the sample material "cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact." It concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." There's no clear indication of malignancy, but the statement doesn't definitively rule it out either due to the artefacts. However, it doesn't directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings. Given the context, the most appropriate answer is "NA" because the statement is inconclusive regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. Since there's no information about the Gleason grade and the sample's malignancy status is inconclusive, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA."

Based on the analysis:

- **Sampletype**: "RP" (because it refers to "the original prostatic operation material," which is most likely from a Radical Prostatectomy)
- **Malignancy**: "NA" (since the results are inconclusive due to artefacts)
- **Gleason**: "NA" (as there's no mention of Gleason grades)

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
