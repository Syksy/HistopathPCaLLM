To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." The key term here is "operation material," which typically refers to a surgical specimen. The most likely sample type related to prostate cancer and involving an "operation material" would be "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). However, the statement does not directly state "RP," and other possibilities like "TURP" could be considered due to the mention of fragmented parts. Yet, "TURP" is not directly indicated either. Given the context, "RP" seems more plausible due to the reference to "prostatic operation material," but it's not a clear-cut indication. The statement, however, does not directly support "biopsy" as it refers to "operation material." Since the statement is not clear and does not directly indicate the sample type, and given the ambiguity, a cautious interpretation might lean towards "NA" due to the lack of a clear indication. However, based on the context that it's "prostatic operation material," one might infer it is likely "RP."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also notes that "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of "relatively normal prostate tissue" does not necessarily indicate malignancy, and the inability to inspect the majority of the sample due to artefacts leads to inconclusive results. Thus, we cannot definitively say "yes" or "no" to malignancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It focuses on the technical challenges and the inconclusive nature of the examination. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" since there's no information provided about the Gleason score.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because the statement is inconclusive regarding the malignancy and does not provide a clear indication of the sample type or the Gleason grade.
