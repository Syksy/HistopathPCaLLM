To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." The term "operation material" suggests it is not a biopsy. The key here is understanding what kind of operation material it refers to. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical operation to remove the prostate. The statement implies that the sample is from a prostate that has been operated on, suggesting it could be from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). However, it doesn't directly state "RP," and other possibilities like "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) could be considered due to the mention of fragmented parts. Yet, "TURP" typically refers to a specific procedure, and the text doesn't directly support this interpretation. Given the context, "RP" seems plausible due to the reference to "the original prostatic operation material," but the statement's ambiguity and the fact that it doesn't directly state the sample type make this a challenging call. The sample is not explicitly stated to be a "biopsy." Therefore, based on the information given and the available choices, "RP" seems like a reasonable guess, but it's not a clear-cut decision.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also notes that "the majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of "relatively normal prostate tissue" does not directly indicate malignancy, and there's no clear mention of malignant findings. The results being "inconclusive" due to technical challenges suggests that a definitive assessment of malignancy couldn't be made. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be "NA" since we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades at all. The Gleason grade is used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and no mention of Gleason grades, the appropriate answer for "Gleason" would be "NA."

Given these considerations, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, it's worth noting that while "RP" is chosen here based on the implication of an "original prostatic operation material," the statement's ambiguity regarding the sample type is acknowledged. A more conservative or strictly evidence-based approach might argue for "Sampletype" to be "NA" due to the lack of explicit information about the sample type. 

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This alternative is also defensible given the ambiguity and the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding the sample type and malignancy status.
