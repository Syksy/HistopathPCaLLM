To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." The term "operation material" suggests it is not a biopsy. The key here is understanding what kind of operation material it refers to. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical operation to remove the prostate. The statement implies that the sample is from a prostate that has been operated on, suggesting it could be from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). However, it specifically mentions "the original prostatic operation material," which could imply a previous surgery like TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) or RP. The exact nature isn't directly stated, but given the context, it seems more aligned with being a re-examination of material from a previous surgery. Since it doesn't directly state "biopsy," "TURP," or "RP" but implies a re-examination of surgical material, the most appropriate choice based on the given options and the context provided would be "RP" if we consider "operation material" to likely refer to a prostatectomy specimen. However, the description as "very fragmented parts" and being "run in three separate batches" could also suggest a complex sample. Despite this, "RP" seems a plausible interpretation for "Sampletype" due to the mention of "prostatic operation material."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also notes that "the majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." Since the statement doesn't directly confirm malignancy and the examination was inconclusive due to technical challenges, the most appropriate answer for "Malignancy" would be "NA" because we cannot conclusively determine the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide any Gleason grade information. It mentions that the results are inconclusive due to a heavy burn artefact, which prevented further inspection. Therefore, "Gleason" should be "NA" as there's no information provided about the Gleason grade.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation is based on the available information and the closest matching options provided. The sample type is inferred to be "RP" due to the context suggesting a prostatectomy specimen, and both "Malignancy" and "Gleason" are marked as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the examination results.
