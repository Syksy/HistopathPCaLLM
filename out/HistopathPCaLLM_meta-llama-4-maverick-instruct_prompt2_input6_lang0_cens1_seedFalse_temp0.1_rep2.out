To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material" and that it is "run in three separate batches." The term "operation material" suggests it is not a biopsy. The key here is understanding what kind of operation material it refers to. "RP" stands for Radical Prostatectomy, which is a surgical operation to remove the prostate. The statement implies that the sample is from a prostate that has been operated on, suggesting it could be from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). However, it specifically mentions "the original prostatic operation material," which could imply a previous surgery. The term "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is another surgical procedure, but the context doesn't directly suggest TURP. Given the context, "RP" seems plausible because it refers to "the original prostatic operation material," but the exact nature (whether it's RP or another type of surgical material) isn't directly stated. However, "RP" is a reasonable interpretation given the context.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed" but also notes that "the majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact" and concludes that "the results are therefore inconclusive." The presence of "relatively normal prostate tissue" doesn't directly indicate malignancy, and the statement doesn't explicitly mention cancer. The results being "inconclusive" due to technical challenges suggests that a definitive assessment of malignancy couldn't be made.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement. The statement doesn't provide any information regarding the Gleason score, which is used for grading prostate cancer.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: The statement implies a surgical specimen, likely from a prostatectomy. So, "RP" could be a reasonable choice, but it's not a clear-cut decision. However, it's the closest valid option given.
- **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't conclusively determine malignancy due to the artefact and concludes with "inconclusive" results. Thus, it can't be definitively said to be "yes" or "no," making "NA" the most appropriate choice.
- **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no mention of a Gleason score or grade, and the sample is not conclusively malignant, "NA" is appropriate.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, based on the given statement, is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This interpretation aligns with the information provided and the constraints of the allowed values for each field.
