To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, the implication is that there is a suspicion of malignancy. For the purpose of this task, since there's a mention of "adenocarcinoma" and the context implies a potential malignancy, we will consider this as "yes" for malignancy, given that the statement directly relates to a potential cancer diagnosis.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. The description is of a "suspicion-level" finding without a definitive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma or a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not provided or determinable from the information given.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the required structure and provides the necessary information based on the histopathological statement provided.
