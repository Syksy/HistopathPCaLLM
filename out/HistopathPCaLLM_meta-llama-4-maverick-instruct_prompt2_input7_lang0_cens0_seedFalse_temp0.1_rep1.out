To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Therefore, we will consider this as a malignant tumor finding because it suggests adenocarcinoma, even though it's not definitive.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It only mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma without grading it. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA" because it's not provided.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information extracted from the histopathological statement according to the guidelines provided.
