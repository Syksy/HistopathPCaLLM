To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies." Therefore, the sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "focus with small glandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma." Although it is mentioned that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and not conclusive, it implies a suspicion of malignancy. Thus, we can consider this as a malignant tumor finding, but with the understanding that the language used indicates some uncertainty. For the purpose of this task, we'll categorize it as "yes" because it suggests adenocarcinoma.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not provide a Gleason grade. It mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not include a Gleason score. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA" because it is not provided.

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion (in this case, the suspicious finding in sample 1B) and avoiding nested structures.
