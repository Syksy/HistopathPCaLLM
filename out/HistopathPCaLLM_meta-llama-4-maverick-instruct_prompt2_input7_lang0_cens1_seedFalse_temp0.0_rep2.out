To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a confirmation of malignancy. However, the statement does not explicitly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. Given the ambiguity and the fact that it doesn't clearly state "malignant tumor findings," the most appropriate answer would be "NA" as it doesn't fit clearly into "yes" or "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. Therefore, it should be considered as "NA" since there's no information provided about the Gleason grade.

Based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the lack of specific information regarding the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade in the provided histopathological statement.
