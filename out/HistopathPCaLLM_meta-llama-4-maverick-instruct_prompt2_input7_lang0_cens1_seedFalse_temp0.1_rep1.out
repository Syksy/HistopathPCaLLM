To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, we cannot directly infer the sample type from the given information. Hence, it should be considered as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "atypical structures and morphological changes" but concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding. This implies that there is suspicion but not a confirmation of malignancy. However, the statement does not clearly state the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, it is most appropriate to consider this as "NA" since it is not definitively "yes" or "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores. This information is crucial for malignant findings, but since the statement doesn't confirm malignancy and doesn't provide Gleason grades, it should be considered as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output aligns with the provided instructions and the example given for non-valid histopathological statements.
