To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostate sample material" but does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, based on the context that it's a sample from the prostate and the mention of "one sample exhibited a point of interest," it could be inferred that it's likely a biopsy. Still, the text does not directly confirm this, and the sample type is not clearly stated as biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, we should consider it as "NA" due to the lack of explicit information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "atypical structures and morphological changes," which suggests some abnormal findings. However, it concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material," indicating that malignancy was not confirmed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer for malignancy is "NA" because the statement does not definitively state the presence or absence of malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. Therefore, the Gleason grade should be reported as "NA".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This output reflects the inability to determine the sample type, malignancy status, or Gleason grade from the provided statement due to the lack of specific information regarding these fields.
