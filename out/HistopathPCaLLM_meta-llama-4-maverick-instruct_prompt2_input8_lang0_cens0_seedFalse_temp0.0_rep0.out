To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate". Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "In the third sample tumor tissue is observed" and mentions "invasive properties", which clearly suggests the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement directly mentions "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7". This provides the Gleason score in the required format. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object represents the structured data extracted from the given histopathological statement, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
