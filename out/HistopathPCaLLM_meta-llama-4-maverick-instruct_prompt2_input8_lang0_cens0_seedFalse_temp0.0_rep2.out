To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze the statement step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate". Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "In the third sample tumor tissue is observed" and mentions "invasive properties", which clearly suggests the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement directly provides the Gleason grade as "4+3=7". This matches the required format for reporting the Gleason grade for malignant statements.

Therefore, structuring the given statement into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the structured data as per the requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format and allowed values.
