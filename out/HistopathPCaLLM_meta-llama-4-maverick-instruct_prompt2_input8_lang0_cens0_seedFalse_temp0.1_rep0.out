To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the instructions provided.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate". Radical prostatectomy is commonly abbreviated as "RP". Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates "tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties", which confirms the presence of malignant tumor findings. Hence, the malignancy is "yes".

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement reports "Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7". This directly provides the Gleason grade in the required format. Thus, the Gleason grade is "4+3=7".

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the specified requirements, focusing on the most severe lesion and providing the information in a non-nested structure with the allowed values.
