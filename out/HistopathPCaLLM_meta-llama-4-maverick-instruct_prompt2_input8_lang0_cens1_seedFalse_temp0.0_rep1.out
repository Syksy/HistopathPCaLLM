To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples and a routine protocol, which is more indicative of a biopsy. There's no clear mention of it being a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Although it doesn't directly state the malignancy status of Sample 3, the discussion around Gleason patterns and suspicion of PIN-changes implies that there might be some concern or investigation for malignancy in Sample 3. However, it explicitly states that the "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and there's no clear statement confirming malignancy in Sample 3. The presence of "immunological activity" and "normal inflammation related changes" is noted, but not a definitive diagnosis of malignancy. Since Sample 3 is the most relevant and there's an implication of potential malignancy but no clear confirmation, and given that the most severe lesion's results are required, the malignancy status could be considered as not definitively "yes". However, since Sample 3 is the focus and it doesn't clearly state "yes" or "no" for malignancy, and the samples with confirmed status (1 and 2) are benign, the interpretation leans towards "NA" for malignancy due to lack of clear confirmation for Sample 3.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart;" which implies that a Gleason score was expected or should have been reported but wasn't. It also mentions that "apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." This indicates that while there was an attempt or expectation to report a Gleason score, it was not successfully recorded or reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade is effectively "NA" due to the lack of a reported score.

Given these analyses, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the information provided in the histopathological statement.
