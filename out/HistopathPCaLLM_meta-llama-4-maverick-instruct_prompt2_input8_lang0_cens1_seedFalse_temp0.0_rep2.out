To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples and indices, which is more typical of a biopsy. There's no clear mention of it being a radical prostatectomy (RP) or a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." Although it doesn't directly state the malignancy status of Sample 3, the discussion around Gleason patterns and suspicion of PIN-changes implies that there might be some concern or indication of malignancy or pre-malignant changes in Sample 3. However, it explicitly states that the highest identified Gleason patterns are missing and there's a mention of a possible "recording mishap," which complicates the interpretation. Since Sample 3 is the one with "some potentially interesting properties" and is the focus, and given that there's no clear statement that it's malignant but rather an implication, we need to be cautious. The most severe lesion's malignancy status isn't directly stated as positive or negative for Sample 3, but the context suggests an investigation into potential malignancy or pre-malignant conditions.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that "major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This indicates that a Gleason score was expected or should have been reported but wasn't due to a possible "recording mishap." Thus, we cannot determine the Gleason grade from the information provided.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: Likely "biopsy" due to the reference to samples and indices.
- **Malignancy**: The statement doesn't directly confirm malignancy in the most relevant sample (Sample 3), and samples 1 and 2 are benign. The focus on Sample 3 and the discussion around Gleason patterns suggest a potential concern, but it's not a clear "yes." 
- **Gleason Grade**: Not available due to the mentioned "recording mishap."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (Sample 3) and adhering to the allowed values, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because, while the sample type can be inferred as "biopsy," the malignancy status and Gleason grade for the most relevant sample are not clearly stated, leading to "NA" for those fields.
