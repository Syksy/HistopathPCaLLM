To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields.

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples and indices, which is common in biopsy reports. There's no clear mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." This directly indicates that samples 1 and 2 are benign. For sample 3, it discusses various histological properties and suspicion of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) changes but does not explicitly confirm malignancy. However, it mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," which implies that there was an expectation or suspicion of malignancy, but it does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings in sample 3. The presence of Gleason patterns typically indicates malignancy, but the statement's phrasing leaves ambiguity. Still, given the context, we can infer that sample 3 is the most relevant and it has some level of suspicion or indication towards malignancy or pre-malignant changes, but it's not a clear "yes" for malignancy due to the lack of a direct statement. However, the presence of Gleason patterns (even if not fully reported) leans towards a malignant context.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart;" This implies that a Gleason score was expected or attempted but not properly recorded or reported. Thus, we cannot directly extract a valid Gleason score.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: Likely "biopsy" due to the mention of samples and indices.
- **Malignancy**: The statement does not directly confirm malignancy in the most relevant sample (sample 3), and samples 1 and 2 are benign. The ambiguity around sample 3's malignancy status and the lack of a clear statement on malignancy for it makes this challenging. However, the context suggests a potential malignancy or pre-malignancy, but it's not a straightforward "yes."
- **Gleason Grade**: Not reported due to "empty fields" and a "recording mishap."

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, focusing on the most severe lesion (sample 3) and adhering to the allowed values, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because:
- The sample type is inferred to be "biopsy."
- Malignancy is not directly confirmed for sample 3, and the statement does not provide a clear "yes" or "no" for the most severe lesion.
- The Gleason score is not available due to a recording issue.

Thus, the structured result reflects the ambiguity and lack of clear information for some fields.
