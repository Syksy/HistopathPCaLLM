To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3" but does not directly indicate the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, it refers to samples and indices, which is common in biopsy reports. There's no clear mention of "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). Thus, based on the context, the most likely sample type is "biopsy." 

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings." This directly indicates that samples 1 and 2 are benign. For sample 3, it discusses various histological properties and suspicion of PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) changes but does not explicitly confirm malignancy. It mentions "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing," which could imply an expectation or suspicion of malignancy, but it does not directly state the presence of malignant tumor findings in sample 3. However, the discussion around Gleason patterns and PIN changes suggests a context where malignancy or pre-malignancy is being considered. Still, the statement does not clearly state that sample 3 contains malignant tumor findings. Thus, we cannot conclusively say "yes" for malignancy for the most severe lesion (sample 3), as it's not directly confirmed.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement indicates that the "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported." This implies that a Gleason score was expected or should have been reported but was not. Thus, we cannot provide a valid Gleason grade.

Given these observations:

- **Sample Type**: Likely "biopsy" due to the mention of samples and indices.
- **Malignancy**: Not directly confirmed for sample 3, and samples 1 and 2 are benign. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine malignancy for the most severe lesion.
- **Gleason Grade**: Not reported.

Therefore, the structured data in JSON format, considering the most severe lesion (sample 3) and the given instructions, would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This is because we cannot confirm malignancy or provide a Gleason score due to the lack of explicit information in the statement regarding these aspects for the most severe lesion (sample 3).
