To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material. TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) is a procedure that involves removing prostate tissue using electrosection. Therefore, the sample type can be inferred as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings are observed," indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings. Thus, the malignancy status is "no".

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia" and mentions no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, it should be reported as "NA".

Putting it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
