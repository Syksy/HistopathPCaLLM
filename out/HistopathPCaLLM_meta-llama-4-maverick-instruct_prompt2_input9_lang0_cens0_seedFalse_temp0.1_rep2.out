To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" as the sample material. This is indicative of a "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as TURP involves removing prostate tissue with an electrocautery device.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly says, "No malignant findings are observed," which directly indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement concludes with "the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia" and mentions "No malignant findings are observed," it implies the sample is benign. Therefore, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value should be "NA".

Putting it all together:

- **Sample Type**: "TURP" because the sample was obtained through electrosection shavings.
- **Malignancy**: "no" since no malignant findings were observed.
- **Gleason Grade**: "NA" because the sample was benign.

The structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
