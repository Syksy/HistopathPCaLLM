To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that a significant amount of material was processed and examined histologically, and the mention of "prostate tissue," we can infer it's likely related to a surgical specimen. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the processing and examination details suggest it could be a significant specimen. Without a clear indication, the most appropriate answer based on the given information is "NA" because the specific type isn't directly mentioned.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal" and notes issues with the sample processing that might affect conclusions. It doesn't directly state the presence or absence of malignancy but implies a lack of clear evidence for malignancy due to the normal appearance of the epithelial cells and issues with the sample. The most straightforward interpretation is that there's no clear indication of malignancy, but it's not definitively stated as benign or malignant. Thus, the most cautious interpretation is "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the statement regarding malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement does not mention Gleason grades or scores at all. It discusses the appearance of prostate tissue and issues with sample processing but doesn't provide any information on tumor grading. Therefore, the appropriate answer is "NA" as there's no information on the Gleason grade.

Given the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This response reflects the lack of specific information in the provided statement regarding the sample type, malignancy status, and Gleason grade.
