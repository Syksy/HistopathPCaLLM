To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that a significant amount of material was processed and examined histologically, and the mention of "prostate tissue," we can infer it's likely related to a surgical specimen. But, without explicit mention of the sample type, and considering the provided options, the most appropriate answer seems to be "NA" because it doesn't directly indicate a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).

2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal," suggesting there's no clear evidence of malignancy. It also mentions that "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" due to suspected faulty processing, but the description leans towards a benign appearance. Thus, the most appropriate answer is "no" for malignancy findings, as there's no clear indication of a malignant tumor.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy and the statement doesn't mention Gleason grades, the appropriate answer for the Gleason grade is "NA."

Therefore, based on the analysis, the structured data in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This JSON output reflects the information that could be reliably extracted from the given histopathological statement.
