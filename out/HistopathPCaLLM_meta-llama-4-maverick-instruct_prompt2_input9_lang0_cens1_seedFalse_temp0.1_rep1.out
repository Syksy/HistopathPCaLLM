To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue." It does not directly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that a significant amount of material was processed and examined histologically, and the mention of "prostate tissue," we can infer it's likely related to a surgical specimen. The statement doesn't directly indicate it's a biopsy, RP (Radical Prostatectomy), or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate). However, the processing and examination details suggest it could be a significant specimen. Without explicit mention, it's challenging to categorize directly into the given categories. Thus, we might lean towards "NA" due to lack of direct information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal," which suggests there's no overt malignancy observed. It also mentions that parts of the glandular structures appear disproportionate but attributes this to possible technical difficulties in processing. There's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, based on the information given, it seems there are no malignant findings reported.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Thus, it should be reported as "NA".

Given these observations, the structured data in JSON format should be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This conclusion is based on the lack of specific information regarding the sample type and the absence of reported malignancy or Gleason grading in the statement.
