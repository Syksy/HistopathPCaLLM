To structure the given histopathological statement into the required JSON format, let's analyze it step by step according to the required fields:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions that "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained" and later refers to "prostate tissue." It does not explicitly state the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). However, given the context that a significant amount of material was processed and examined histologically, and the mention of "prostate tissue," we can infer it's likely related to a surgical specimen. But without explicit mention of the type, and considering the context doesn't clearly point to "RP" or "TURP," and it's not a typical description for a biopsy due to the quantity of material, the safest choice based on the information given is "NA" because the sample type isn't clearly identified.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the epithelial cell lining as "rather normal" and attributes some observed irregularities in glandular structures to technical difficulties in processing. It concludes that the material examined does not allow for conclusive conclusions and suspects faulty processing. There's no clear indication of malignancy; in fact, the description leans towards a benign or non-conclusive finding due to processing issues. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is "no" because there's no clear evidence of malignancy, and the tone suggests a non-malignant interpretation or an inability to conclude malignancy.

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there's no indication of malignancy and the statement doesn't mention Gleason grades, the appropriate answer is "NA."

Putting it all together in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the most appropriate interpretation based on the given histopathological statement.
