Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is inferred as "biopsy" since the text mentions "Chipping samples" and "six blocks", which is a common method for processing biopsy samples.
2. The text explicitly states "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma", which indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the finding is benign and there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
