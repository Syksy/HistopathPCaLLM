Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as indicated by the mention of "Chipping samples" and "six blocks", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. The text explicitly states that there were "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma", indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings.
3. Since the finding is benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and "NA" is reported.

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks. In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. The finding thus fits the suspected benign prostate hyperplasia."
