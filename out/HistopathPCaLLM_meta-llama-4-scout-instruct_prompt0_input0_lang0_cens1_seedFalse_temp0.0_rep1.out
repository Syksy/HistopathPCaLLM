Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to infer it from the statement, so it is set to "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so it is set to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it is set to "NA".
