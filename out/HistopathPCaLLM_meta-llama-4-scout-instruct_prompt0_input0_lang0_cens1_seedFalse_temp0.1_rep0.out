Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's classified as "NA".
2. The text explicitly states that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so it's classified as "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's classified as "NA".
