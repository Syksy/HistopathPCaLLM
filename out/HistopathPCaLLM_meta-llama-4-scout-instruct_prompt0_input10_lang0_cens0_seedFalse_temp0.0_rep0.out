Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "prostate systematic biopsies".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain but "leaning towards benign" and the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "NA" since the statement does not provide a Gleason grade and the conclusion is leaning towards benign.
