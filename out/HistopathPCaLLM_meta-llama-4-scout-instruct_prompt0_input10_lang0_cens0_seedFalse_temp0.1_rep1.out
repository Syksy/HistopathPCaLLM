Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "8 representative prostate systematic biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions a "suspicious focus" but concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain and "leaning towards benign", which implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the diagnosis is leaning towards benign and there are no definitive malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
