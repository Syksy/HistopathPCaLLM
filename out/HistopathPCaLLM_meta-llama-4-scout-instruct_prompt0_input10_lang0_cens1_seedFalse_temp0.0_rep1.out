Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The text does not mention the specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set it to "NA".
2. The text mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set it to "NA".

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data was not provided in the end of these instructions as a separate entity;  however, I can process it if provided.
