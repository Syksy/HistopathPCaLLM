Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The text does not mention the specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set it to "NA".
2. The text mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were present, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for next task is awaited.
