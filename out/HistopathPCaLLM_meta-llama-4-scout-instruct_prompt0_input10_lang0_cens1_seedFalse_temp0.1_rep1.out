Based on the provided text, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The text does not mention the specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set it to "NA".
2. The text mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set it to "NA".
