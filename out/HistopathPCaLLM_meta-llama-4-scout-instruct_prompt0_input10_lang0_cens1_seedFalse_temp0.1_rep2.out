Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA" (not available).
2. The text mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which suggests that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set it to "NA".
