Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason grading of "4+3", which is a valid format for a Gleason grade. I added the sum (=7) to the answer, as it is a common way to express the Gleason grade.
