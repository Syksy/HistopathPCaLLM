Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason grading of "4+3", which is a valid format for a Gleason grade. I added "=7" to the result, but this is not strictly necessary as the sum is implied. 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Prostatectomy preparate was run according to the standard protocol, with weight approx 80g. Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed, which appear to form merging grandular tubules with a Gleason grading 4+3. On the sample slide a max size 3 cm in diameter malignant focus is in the apex and central lobe. The finding covers approx 15% of the sections' area. High-grade PIN formation is also observed around the tumor tissue. Basis and the vehicles appear to be free of malignant findings. Margins appear to be clean.
