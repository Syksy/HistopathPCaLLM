Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and "the whole material", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is a reasonable inference.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that the prostate tissue "appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages", but it does not indicate the presence of malignant tumors. Additionally, it mentions that the evaluation of high-grade PIN (a precursor to cancer) "remains inconclusive". Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, and the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that the Gleason scores "could not be reliably assessed" due to the limited amount of material that could be investigated (only 5%). Therefore, I conclude that the Gleason grade is not assessable, and the answer is "NA".
