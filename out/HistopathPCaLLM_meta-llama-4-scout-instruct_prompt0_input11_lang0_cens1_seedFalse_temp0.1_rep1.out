Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and "the whole material", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is a reasonable inference.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text describes the prostate tissue as forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages", but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumors. The evaluation of high-grade PIN presence is inconclusive, which implies that there is no clear evidence of malignancy. Therefore, I have classified this as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that the Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed, as only a small fraction (5%) of the material could be investigated. Therefore, I have classified the Gleason grade as "NA". 

Please let me know if you would like me to process more text. I will also need the raw data you mentioned, but it was not provided in your message. If you provide more text or the raw data, I'll be happy to help.
