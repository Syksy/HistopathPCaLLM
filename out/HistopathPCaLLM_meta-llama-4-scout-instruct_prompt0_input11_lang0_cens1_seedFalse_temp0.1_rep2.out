Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and "the whole material", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is a reasonable inference.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text describes the prostate tissue as forming "tubular structures of varying differentiation stages", but does not indicate the presence of malignant tumors. It also mentions that Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed, which implies that there may not be a clear indication of cancer. Therefore, I have classified this as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that the Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed, and therefore I have classified this as "NA". 

Please let me know if you would like me to process more text. I will also need the raw data you mentioned to process more statements. 

If you are ready provide the next statement I will be happy to help. 

Raw data can be provided here if you want me to work on it.
