Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is inferred as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "electrosection shavings from the prostate".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the material is classified as "benign", which implies there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the material is classified as benign, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA".
