Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement, so I set it to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'm ready to process it! 

(Raw data was not provided, so I assume it will be given in the next prompt)
