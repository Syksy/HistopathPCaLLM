Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate needle biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The text explicitly mentions "carcinoma" in sample B, indicating malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+5=9", which matches the required format. 

Note that I ignored the information about the percentage of the higher-grade differentiation (20% on the left) and the mention of Gleason score 5, as the problem statement asks for the most severe lesion and the Gleason grade in the format "major+minor=sum".
