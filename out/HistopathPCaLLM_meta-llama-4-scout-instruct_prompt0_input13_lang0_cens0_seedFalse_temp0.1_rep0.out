Based on the provided text, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate needle biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The text explicitly mentions "carcinoma" in sample B, indicating malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+5=9", which matches the required format. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The samples consist of prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations, totalling approx 60mm on the right and approx 80mm on the left. In sample B carcinoma is observed, reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5). This higher grade differentiation consists of approx 20% on the left. In rest of the samples normal grandular structures are observed, without any significant inflammation either."
