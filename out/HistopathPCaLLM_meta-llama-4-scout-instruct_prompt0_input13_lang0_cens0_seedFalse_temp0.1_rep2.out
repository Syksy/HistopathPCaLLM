Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate needle biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "carcinoma is observed" in sample B, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason score is reported as "4+5=9", which is in the desired format. 

Note that I ignored the information about the percentage of the higher-grade differentiation (20% on the left) and the mention of Gleason score 5, as the problem statement asks for the results from the most severe lesion, which seems to be represented by the Gleason score 9 (4+5). Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more data! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The samples consist of prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations, totalling approx 60mm on the right and approx 80mm on the left. In sample B carcinoma is observed, reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5). This higher grade differentiation consists of approx 20% on the left. In rest of the samples normal grandular structures are observed, without any significant inflammation either."
