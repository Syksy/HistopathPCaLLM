Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as the statement mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and "sample B".
2. There are no clear indications of malignant tumor findings, as the statement only mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious patterns" that require further inspection and verification. Therefore, I have classified it as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I have classified it as "NA".
