Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The sample type is likely a biopsy, as the statement mentions "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate" and "sample B". This suggests a biopsy procedure, so I chose "biopsy" as the sample type.
2. The statement mentions "some irregularities" and a "suspicious pattern", but it also states that "at this time further verification is needed via consultation". This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings, so I chose "no" for this field.
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I chose "NA" for this field.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Now, please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'll be happy to help.
