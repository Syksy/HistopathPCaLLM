Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated as "RP", "TURP", or another type, I've assumed "biopsy" as the most plausible option.
2. The statement mentions that "some irregularities are observed" and a "suspicious pattern" is present, but it also states that "at this time further verification is needed via consultation". This implies that there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, so I've set this field to "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I've set this field to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the next statement! 

Raw data for next statement is not provided, I assume it will be given when it is needed.
