Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as a "prostatetectomy preparate", which corresponds to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the value for "sample_type" is set to "RP".
2. The text explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "7-stage carcinoma" with a larger portion of score 3 (approximately 60%). This suggests a Gleason score of 3+4=7. Therefore, the value for "gleason_grade" is set to "3+4=7".
