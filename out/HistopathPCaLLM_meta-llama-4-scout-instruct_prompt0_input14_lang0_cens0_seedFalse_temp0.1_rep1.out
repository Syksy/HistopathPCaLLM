Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. The text explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings". This implies that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, where the major component is 3 and the minor component is 4, summing up to 7.

Raw data used for this example: 

"The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate, which is run on casettes according to normal routines. Samples D-G have apex, basis in samples K-P, seminal vehicles O-Q. Already in first section some tumorous growth is observed peripherally, with the tumor growth reaching near the capsule border. No breach is seen nor is there any pos. surgical margins. Basis and seminal vehicles are clean. The found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings."
