Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason grade of 7, with a larger portion of score 3 (approximately 60%) and implies a minor score of 4. I formatted this as "3+4=7" to match the desired output format.
