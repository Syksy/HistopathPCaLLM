Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue" and "samples D-G", "samples K-P", and "sample material drawn from roughly the prostate capsule border region". This suggests that the sample type is a biopsy, which is a procedure where a small sample of tissue is taken from the prostate gland.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits" that warrant further investigation. Additionally, a colleague mentions a comparison to a recent Gleason 7 score patient, implying that there may be concerns about malignancy. Therefore, I infer that there are malignant tumor findings, and set this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a comparison to a Gleason 7 score patient, but does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for this patient. In fact, the text suggests that further investigation is needed to "rule out mid-grade GG findings". Therefore, I set this field to "NA", as a specific Gleason grade is not reported.
