Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits found", but it does not explicitly state that there are malignant tumor findings. In fact, it suggests that further investigation is needed to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Therefore, I have classified it as "no" (no malignant tumor findings reported).
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, but it does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for the current patient. Additionally, it suggests that further investigation is needed before making a statement affecting potential intervention decisions. Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
