Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits found", but it does not explicitly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The tone of the text suggests that the findings are potentially suspicious, but a definitive diagnosis of malignancy is not made. Therefore, I have classified it as "no" (no malignant tumor findings reported).
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, but it does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for the current patient. Additionally, the text suggests that further investigation is needed before making a statement about the Gleason grade. Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
