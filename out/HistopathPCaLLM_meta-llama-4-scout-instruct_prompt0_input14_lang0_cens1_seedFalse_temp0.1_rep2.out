Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: Although the text mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The text actually suggests that further investigation is needed before making any conclusions. Therefore, I have classified it as "no" (no malignant tumor findings reported).
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, but it does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for the current patient. In fact, it suggests that further investigation is needed to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
