Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "Prostate chippings" which implies that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. The text explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer to this question is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+4=8. 

Note that I assumed the sample type to be TURP based on the mention of "chippings" and the context of the text. If more information were provided, this assumption could be confirmed or refuted. However, based on the provided text, TURP seems to be the most plausible answer. 

Also, I used the most severe lesion information as per your instructions, which in this case is the adenocarcinoma with a Gleason grade of 4+4=8. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Patient has been considered suspect before due to elevation of PSA. Scopic inspection through the shavings does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material, with the Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. The finding therefore confirms the earlier suspicion.
