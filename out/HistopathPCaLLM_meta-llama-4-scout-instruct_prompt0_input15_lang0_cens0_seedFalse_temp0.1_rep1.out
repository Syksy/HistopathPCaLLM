Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The sample type is mentioned as "Prostate chippings" which implies that the sample was obtained through a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. The text explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor, so the answer to this question is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8". This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+4=8. 

Note that I assumed the Gleason grade pattern to be in the format "major+minor=sum" as per your instructions. Let me know if this is not correct. 

Also, please find the raw data below for your reference:

 Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Patient has been considered suspect before due to elevation of PSA. Scopic inspection through the shavings does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material, with the Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. The finding therefore confirms the earlier suspicion.
