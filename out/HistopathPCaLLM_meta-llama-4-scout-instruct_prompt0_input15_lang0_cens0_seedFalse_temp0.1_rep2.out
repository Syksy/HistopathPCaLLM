Based on the provided text, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text explicitly states that "adenocarcinoma" was found throughout the sample material, which indicates a malignant tumor finding, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that the Gleason grade 4 is the most represented, along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. This suggests that the Gleason grade is 4+4=8. 

Note that I've assumed that the Gleason grade is reported as "major+minor=sum" as per your instructions. If the text had reported the Gleason grade differently, I would have adjusted the answer accordingly. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Patient has been considered suspect before due to elevation of PSA. Scopic inspection through the shavings does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material, with the Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. The finding therefore confirms the earlier suspicion.
