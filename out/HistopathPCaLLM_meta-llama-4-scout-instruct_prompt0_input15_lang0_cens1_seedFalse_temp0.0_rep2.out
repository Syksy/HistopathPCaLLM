Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Prostate tissue material" and "biopsy" is a reasonable inference given the context, although it's not explicitly stated. I chose "biopsy" as it's a common sample type for prostate cancer histopathology.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that the suspicion of adenocarcinoma was not based on histopathology. This implies that there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, so I chose "no".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that a Gleason sum of 8 or above was suspected, but this was not based on histopathology and could not be confirmed. Therefore, I chose "NA" as the Gleason grade is not reported.

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

 Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Based on complementing clinical notes of the patient, the tissue material was processed with a high priority. Preliminary scopic inspection through the sample material confirms that the symptoms reported in the clinical notes may have a basis on histopathology, although representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time (clinical notes mentioned suspected presence of an adenocaricoma following disease trajectory akin to e.g. Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology). Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session, in order to be able to either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion.
