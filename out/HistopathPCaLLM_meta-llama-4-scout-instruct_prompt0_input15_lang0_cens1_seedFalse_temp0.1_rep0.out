Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the answers:

1. The sample type is inferred as "biopsy" since the text mentions "Prostate tissue material" and a "meager weight" which is consistent with a biopsy sample.
2. The text explicitly states that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that the suspicion of adenocarcinoma was not based on any histopathology, indicating that there were no malignant tumor findings in this examination.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "NA" since the text states that a Gleason grade could not be determined and the clinical notes mentioned a suspected presence of adenocarcinoma with a Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology.

Raw data for testing purposes: 

 Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Based on complementing clinical notes of the patient, the tissue material was processed with a high priority. Preliminary scopic inspection through the sample material confirms that the symptoms reported in the clinical notes may have a basis on histopathology, although representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time (clinical notes mentioned suspected presence of an adenocaricoma following disease trajectory akin to e.g. Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology). Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session, in order to be able to either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion.
