Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the answers:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" based on the context that the tissue material is described as having a "very meager weight" and that it's a prostate tissue sample.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings confirmed in the histopathology, as it's mentioned that "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and that the suspicion of adenocarcinoma needs to be revised in the next histologic examination session. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "NA" since it's mentioned that a Gleason grade or other marker could not be determined at this time, and the clinical notes' mention of a suspected Gleason sum is not based on any histopathology.

Raw data for testing purposes: 

 Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Based on complementing clinical notes of the patient, the tissue material was processed with a high priority. Preliminary scopic inspection through the sample material confirms that the symptoms reported in the clinical notes may have a basis on histopathology, although representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time (clinical notes mentioned suspected presence of an adenocaricoma following disease trajectory akin to e.g. Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology). Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session, in order to be able to either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion.
