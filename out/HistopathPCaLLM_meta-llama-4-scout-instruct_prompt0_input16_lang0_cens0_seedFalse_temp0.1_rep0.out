Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "sample_type" is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grading, concluding that the score is 7, with architecture 3 covering approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covering approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma part. This translates to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"The inspected material consists of three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate. Along the total length 30mm approximately half contains carcinoma focuses, so that lengths approx 7, 6, and 2mm. In these mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4 -type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third of the carcinoma length. Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part."
