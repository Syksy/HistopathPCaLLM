Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "sample_type" is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides a detailed description of the Gleason grading, concluding that the score is 7, with architecture 3 covering approximately 2/3 and architecture 4 covering approximately 1/3 of the carcinoma part. This translates to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Therefore, the value for "gleason_grade" is set to "3+4=7".
