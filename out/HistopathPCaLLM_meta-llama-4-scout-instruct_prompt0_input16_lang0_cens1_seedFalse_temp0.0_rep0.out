Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "digital histopathology", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I have assigned "biopsy" as the sample type.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci", "various grades of cell differentiation", and the need for manual grading, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. I have assigned "yes" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and that a mid-grade differentiation (e.g., 3+4 or 4+3) would be difficult to assess. Therefore, I have assigned "NA" to this field, as a specific Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined from the text.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further clarification! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate. Among the total sample material, about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns that were closely inspected in digital histopathology. In these, various grades of cell differentation are observed, although assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. Conclusion is that grading of the sample content ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, and then re-entered into the statement system. This scrutiny is warranted, as any mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentation would be very difficult to reliable assess due to some mishap in digitalization."
