Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "digital histopathology", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I have assigned "biopsy" as the sample type.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci" and "various grades of cell differentiation", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. I have assigned "yes" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images, and that grading ought to be conducted manually on the slides. Therefore, I have assigned "NA" to this field, as the Gleason grade could not be reliably assessed.

Note that I've followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing other cases will be appreciated.
