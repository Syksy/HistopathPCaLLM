Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "digital histopathology", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I have assigned "biopsy" as the sample type.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci", "various grades of cell differentiation", and the need for manual grading, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. I have assigned "yes" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: Although the text mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" and the possibility of "mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation", it also states that assigning explicit scores is "inconclusive due to resolution issues". Therefore, I have assigned "NA" to this field, as a specific Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined from the text.
