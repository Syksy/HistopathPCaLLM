Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "digital histopathology", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since "biopsy" is one of the allowed values, I chose that.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci" and "various grades of cell differentiation", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I chose "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: Although the text mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" and "mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation", it also states that assigning explicit scores is "inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images". Therefore, I chose "NA" since a conclusive Gleason grade is not reported.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate. Among the total sample material, about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns that were closely inspected in digital histopathology. In these, various grades of cell differentation are observed, although assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. Conclusion is that grading of the sample content ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, and then re-entered into the statement system. This scrutiny is warranted, as any mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentation would be very difficult to reliable assess due to some mishap in digitalization."
