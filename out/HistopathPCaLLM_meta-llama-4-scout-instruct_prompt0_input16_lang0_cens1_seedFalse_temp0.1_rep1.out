Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "digital histopathology", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I will assume it is a biopsy.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci", "various grades of cell differentiation", and the need for manual grading, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. I will set this to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and that a mid-grade differentiation (e.g., 3+4 or 4+3) would be difficult to assess. Therefore, I will set the Gleason grade to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the raw data provided. 

(Also, please provide the raw data, I'm ready to process it)
