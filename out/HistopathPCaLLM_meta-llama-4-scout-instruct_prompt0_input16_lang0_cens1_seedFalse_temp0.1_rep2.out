Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "multiple suspicious foci from the prostate" and "tissue that exhibits patterns", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since there's no explicit mention of RP, TURP, or other types, I've assumed it's a biopsy.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "suspicious foci", "various grades of cell differentiation", and the need for manual grading, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I've set this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: Although the text mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" and the possibility of mid-grade differentiation (e.g., 3+4 or 4+3), it also states that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. Therefore, I've set this field to "NA", as a specific Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined from the text.

Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like me to revise anything! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate. Among the total sample material, about half of it contains tissue that exhibits patterns that were closely inspected in digital histopathology. In these, various grades of cell differentation are observed, although assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. Conclusion is that grading of the sample content ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, and then re-entered into the statement system. This scrutiny is warranted, as any mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentation would be very difficult to reliable assess due to some mishap in digitalization."
