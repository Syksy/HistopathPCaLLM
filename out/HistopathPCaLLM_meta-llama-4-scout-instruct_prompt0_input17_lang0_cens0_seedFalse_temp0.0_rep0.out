Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which suggests that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The text describes "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". This suggests that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7, which is a common way to report the Gleason grade for malignant prostate cancer.
