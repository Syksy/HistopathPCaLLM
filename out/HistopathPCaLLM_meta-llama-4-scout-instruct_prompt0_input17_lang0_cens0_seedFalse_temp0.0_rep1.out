Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The text mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which suggests that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The text describes "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The text mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which suggests a Gleason grade of 4+3=7.
