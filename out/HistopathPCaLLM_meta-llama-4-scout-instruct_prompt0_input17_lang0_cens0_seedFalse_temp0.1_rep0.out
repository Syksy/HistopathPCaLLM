Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The text mentions "Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The text reports a Gleason grade of "4 along with some grade 3", which implies that the most severe lesion has a Gleason grade of 4+3=7. 

Note that I have followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures, and only reported the results from the most severe lesion.
