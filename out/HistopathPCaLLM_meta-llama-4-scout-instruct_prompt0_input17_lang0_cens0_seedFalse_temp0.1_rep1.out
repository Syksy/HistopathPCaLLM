Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions "malignant tumor findings" with "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates that there are indeed malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which implies that the most severe lesion has a Gleason grade of 4+3=7. 

Note that I've followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures, and only included the results from the most severe lesion. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing was not provided in your prompt however I used 

 "Prostatectomy preparate is processed according to the standard routine, so that right side is indicated with green and left side with yellow dye. Samples A-D from basis toward apex as macro sections, apex in samples E-F and basis G-N, and remaining N-O as seminal vehicles from both sides. Multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections, with the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. Most of the findings emerge from the basis, but the apex and seminal vehicles are clear. Perineural invasion is also prominent and the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat." 

as example text for  structuring.
