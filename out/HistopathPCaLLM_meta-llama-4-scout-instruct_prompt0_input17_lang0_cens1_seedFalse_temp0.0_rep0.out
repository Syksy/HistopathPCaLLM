Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "processed through the standard routine procedures", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I have assigned "biopsy" as the sample type.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present" but also mentions that "the material is fully healthy" is a possibility. However, the presence of Gleason stages 3-5 suggests that there might be some abnormal cells, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. Given the context, I have assigned "no" as the malignant tumor findings, as there is no clear indication of malignant tumors.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", but since there is no clear indication of malignant tumors, I have assigned "NA" as the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the raw data for more statements to process. I'm ready to help!
