Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "processed through the standard routine procedures", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. I have assigned it a value of "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present" but also mentions that "the material is fully healthy" is a possibility. However, the presence of Gleason stages 3-5 suggests that there might be some abnormal cells, but it's not explicitly stated as malignant. Given the context, I have assigned a value of "no" to malignant tumor findings, as it's not explicitly confirmed.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", but it's not clear if this is a definitive finding or just a possibility. Since there is no explicit confirmation of a malignant tumor, I have assigned a value of "NA" to the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like me to revise anything!
