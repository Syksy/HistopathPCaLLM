Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D".
2. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, as the text only mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present" in a hypothetical sense, and states that "the material is fully healthy".
3. The Gleason grade is not reported, as the text mentions that this assessment will be done later by resident candidates, and therefore the result is "NA". 

Let me know if you agree with my interpretation!
