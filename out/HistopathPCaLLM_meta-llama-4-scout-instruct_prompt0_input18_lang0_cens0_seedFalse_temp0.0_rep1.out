Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by the phrase "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure".
2. There are malignant tumor findings, as indicated by the phrase "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "3+4=7", as indicated by the phrase "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area". I inferred that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, as the statement mentions a larger fraction with stage 3 and implies a secondary grade of 4. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure are processed through 12 tissue blocks. In the chippings, a small fraction appears to be carcinoma. The growth appears mainly as separate granular nodules as well as some melding can be observed, but the fraction of carcinoma remains small (less than 5%). The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area."
