Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as the statement mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure", which is a common method for TURP samples.
2. The statement mentions that "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area". This suggests that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, which is a common way to report the Gleason score. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure are processed through 12 tissue blocks. In the chippings, a small fraction appears to be carcinoma. The growth appears mainly as separate granular nodules as well as some melding can be observed, but the fraction of carcinoma remains small (less than 5%). The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area."
