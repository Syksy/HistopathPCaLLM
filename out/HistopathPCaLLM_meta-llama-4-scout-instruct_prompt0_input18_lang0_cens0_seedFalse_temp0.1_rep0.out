Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure", which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma" and "neoplastic", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason sum of 7, with a larger fraction having a stage of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. Assuming the remaining 40% has a higher stage (e.g., 4), I inferred the Gleason grade as 3+4=7.
