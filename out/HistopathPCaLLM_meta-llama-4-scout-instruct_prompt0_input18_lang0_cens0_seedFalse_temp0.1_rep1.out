Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure", which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma" and "neoplastic", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason sum of 7, with a larger fraction having a stage of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. This implies that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. 

Note that I've followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure are processed through 12 tissue blocks. In the chippings, a small fraction appears to be carcinoma. The growth appears mainly as separate granular nodules as well as some melding can be observed, but the fraction of carcinoma remains small (less than 5%). The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area."
