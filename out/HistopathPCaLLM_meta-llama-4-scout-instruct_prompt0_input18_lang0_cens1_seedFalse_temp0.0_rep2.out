Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate related procedures" and "tissue batches", which suggests a biopsy procedure. Although it's not explicitly stated, I infer that the sample type is likely a "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions a "region of interest" that "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above", which implies that there are potential malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text states that the "suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group", which means that a Gleason grade cannot be determined. Therefore, I set this field to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the next statement. The raw data for the next statement is not provided yet, I assume. 

Please provide the next statement to process.
