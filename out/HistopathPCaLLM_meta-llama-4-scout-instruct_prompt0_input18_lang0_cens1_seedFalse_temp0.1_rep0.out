Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate related procedures" and "tissue batches", which suggests a biopsy procedure. Although it's not explicitly stated, based on the context, I'm assuming it's a biopsy. If more information were available, I might be able to make a more informed decision, but given the provided text, "biopsy" seems the most plausible choice.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement mentions a "region of interest" that "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above", which implies that there are potential malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I'm setting this field to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions that the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group", which means that a Gleason grade cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, I'm setting this field to "NA". 

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you'd like me to process more data. 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

You provided the text: 
"Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches. In the sample material, a small fraction appears to stand out. The region of interest seems to form normal cell architecture, but a small fraction would require further inspection (less than 5%). The smaller portion that warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above, but the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group. On the other hand, >95% of material appears benign on preliminary inspection."
