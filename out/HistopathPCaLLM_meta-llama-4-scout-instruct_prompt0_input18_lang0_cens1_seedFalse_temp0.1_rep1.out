Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate related procedures" and "tissue batches", which suggests a biopsy procedure. Although it's not explicitly stated, based on the context, I'm assuming it's a biopsy. Therefore, I've assigned "biopsy" to the `sample_type` field.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement mentions a "small fraction" that "warrants further investigation" and "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above". This implies that there are potential malignant tumor findings, so I've assigned "yes" to the `malignant_tumor_findings` field.
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions that the suspicious focus is "too small to properly assign a grade group". However, it does mention "ISUP GG 1 or above", which implies a potential Gleason grade, but it's not possible to determine a specific grade. Therefore, I've assigned "NA" to the `gleason_grade` field.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you'd like me to revise anything! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches. In the sample material, a small fraction appears to stand out. The region of interest seems to form normal cell architecture, but a small fraction would require further inspection (less than 5%). The smaller portion that warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above, but the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group. On the other hand, >95% of material appears benign on preliminary inspection.
