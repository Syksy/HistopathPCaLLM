Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "targeted prostate biopsies", which corresponds to a value of "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "sample 4... appears to contain adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%", which can be combined to form a Gleason grade of "3+4=7". 

Note that I only considered the results from the most severe lesion (sample 4) and ignored the benign findings in samples 2 and 3. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used for this example: 

The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations. Sample 1) 10mm, 2) 8mm, 3) 14mm and 4) 14mm in material amount. Sample 1 is unrepresentative of the prostate, while samples 2 and 3 represent healthy benign prostate tissue. In sample 4, the whole cylinder's length appears to contain adenocarcinoma, with the larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%). Breaching of the capsule or perineural invasion is not suspected based on the current sample material, although definitive inspection would require imaging.
