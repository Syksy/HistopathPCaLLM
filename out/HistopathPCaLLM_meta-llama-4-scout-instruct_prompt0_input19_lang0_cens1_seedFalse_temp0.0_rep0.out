Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or a clear indication of the sample type, so I set it to "NA".
2. There is a mention of a possible malignant finding in sample 4, but it's not confirmed, and the statement suggests that further verification is needed. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "NA".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, I set the "gleason_grade" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the next statement. The raw data for the next statement is not provided yet, I assume.
