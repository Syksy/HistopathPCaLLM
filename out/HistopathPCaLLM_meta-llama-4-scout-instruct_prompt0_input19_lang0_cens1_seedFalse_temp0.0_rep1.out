Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. The text mentions that sample 4 may contain "abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant)", but it is not confirmed, and further verification is needed. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "NA".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".
