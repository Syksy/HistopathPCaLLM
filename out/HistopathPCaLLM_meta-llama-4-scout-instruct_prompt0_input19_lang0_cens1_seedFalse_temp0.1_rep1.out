Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. There is a mention of a possible malignant finding in sample 4, but it is not confirmed, and further verification is required. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".

Note that the statement does not provide conclusive information about the sample type, malignant tumor findings, or Gleason grade. If more information were provided, it might be possible to extract more specific values for these fields.
