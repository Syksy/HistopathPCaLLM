Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "needle biopsies".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. The reported Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since the conclusion is that only benign-like growth is observed.
