Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy" sample type.
2. The statement explicitly concludes that "only benign-like growth is observed", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the statement indicates that the growth is benign, there is no Gleason grade reported, so the answer is "NA".
