Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the results appear "inconclusive" and that additional inspection is required regarding malignancy, but it does not provide evidence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. The statement mentions that additional inspection is required regarding "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings", implying that no conclusive Gleason grade was determined. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".
