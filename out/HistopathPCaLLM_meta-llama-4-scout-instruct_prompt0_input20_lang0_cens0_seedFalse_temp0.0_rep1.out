Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor, so the value is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement reports two different Gleason grades: "3+4" and "4+4". Since we only need to return the results from the most severe lesion, I chose the higher grade, which is "4+4=8". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing was: 

"The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection, which has been divided into six macrosections and the usual microscopic sections. Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma. Longitudinal section from the apex shows microscopically both fusing of the grandular structures, fitting best into the Gleason 3+4 staging, while the basis presents mostly with class 4+4. The size of these malignant focuses are approx. 8mm and 5mm, respectively. However, no breaching of the prostate capsule is observed, and the surgical margins are clear."
