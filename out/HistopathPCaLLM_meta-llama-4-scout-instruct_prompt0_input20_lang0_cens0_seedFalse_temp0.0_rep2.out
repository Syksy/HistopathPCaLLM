Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor, so the value is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement reports two different Gleason grades: "3+4" and "4+4". Since we need to return the results from the most severe lesion, I chose the higher grade, which is "4+4=8". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing was not provided in your prompt, but I assume it will be provided for further testing. If you provide more data I can help you with further processing.
