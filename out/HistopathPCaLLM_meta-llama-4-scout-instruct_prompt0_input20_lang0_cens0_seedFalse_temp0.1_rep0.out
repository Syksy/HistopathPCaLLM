Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned for both the apex and basis. The basis presents with a more severe lesion, which is classified as "4+4". I will use this value as the reported Gleason grade.

Note that I used the more severe lesion's Gleason grade, as per the instructions. If the statement only mentioned one lesion, I would have used that value. In this case, the apex has a Gleason grade of 3+4, but the basis has a more severe lesion with a grade of 4+4, which takes precedence.
