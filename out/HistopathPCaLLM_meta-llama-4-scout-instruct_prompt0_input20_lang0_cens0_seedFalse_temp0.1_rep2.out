Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", indicating malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned for both the apex and basis. The basis presents with a more severe lesion, which is classified as "4+4". I will use this value as the reported Gleason grade.

Note that I used the more severe lesion's Gleason grade, as per your instructions. Also, I used the "major+minor=sum" format for the Gleason grade, as preferred.
