Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "prostate tissue samples" and "examination of possible adenocarcinoma", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is the most likely option given the context.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region" and that the prostate tissue samples "have been highly affected". This implies that no malignant tumor findings were possible to determine, but it does not explicitly state that there are no malignant tumors. However, given the context, I have interpreted this as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of "3+4", but this is not a reported finding. Instead, it suggests that the patient's disease burden is influenced by other factors, and that re-sampling may be necessary. Therefore, I have reported the Gleason grade as "NA".
