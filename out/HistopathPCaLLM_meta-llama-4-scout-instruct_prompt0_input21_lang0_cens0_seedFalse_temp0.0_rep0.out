Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "clearly visible nucleoli", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports that the most common Gleason grading is 5 and the second most common is 4. Since we only need to report the results from the most severe lesion, I will use the highest Gleason grade mentioned, which is 5. The structured result should be in the format "major+minor=sum", so I will report it as "5+4=9". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology. Fibromuscular stroma is prevalent along with carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma. Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible. Roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue, with the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4.
