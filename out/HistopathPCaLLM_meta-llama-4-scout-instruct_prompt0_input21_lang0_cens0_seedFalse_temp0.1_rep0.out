Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "clearly visible nucleoli", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports that the most common Gleason grading is 5 and the second most common is 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "5+4=9", which follows the preferred format of "major+minor=sum". 

Note that I have only considered the most severe lesion, as per the instructions. Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology. Fibromuscular stroma is prevalent along with carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma. Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible. Roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue, with the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4."
