Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "clearly visible nucleoli", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports that the most common Gleason grading is 5 and the second most common is 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "5+4=9". 

Note that I've followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology. Fibromuscular stroma is prevalent along with carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma. Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible. Roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue, with the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4.
