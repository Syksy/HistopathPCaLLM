Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "clearly visible nucleoli", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports that the most common Gleason grading is 5 and the second most common is 4. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "5+4=9", which follows the preferred format of "major+minor=sum". 

Note that I've followed the instructions to only report the results from the most severe lesion and to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures.
