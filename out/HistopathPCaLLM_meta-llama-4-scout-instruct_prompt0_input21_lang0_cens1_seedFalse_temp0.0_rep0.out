Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions "The extracted prostate material" and "prostate material totals several fragments", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, as the text mentions that "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that the material is too noisy to make a proper assessment. Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, or at least, they cannot be confirmed.
3. The Gleason grade is not reported, and given the noisy nature of the material and the need for additional QC, it is not possible to determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, I set it to "NA". 

Please let me know if you'd like me to process more text. 

Raw data will be provided later, I'm ready when you are.
