Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions "The extracted prostate material" and "prostate material...been put to histology", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. There is no clear evidence of malignant tumor findings, as the text mentions "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns" and "the nuclei are dissolved", indicating that the material is not suitable for a conclusive assessment. Therefore, I have classified this as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. The Gleason grade cannot be determined due to the technical issues mentioned in the text, so I have classified this as "NA".

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."
