Based on the provided text, I will attempt to extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions "The extracted prostate material" and "prostate material totals several fragments", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. There is no clear evidence of malignant tumor findings, as the text mentions that "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that the material is "noisy". Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, or at least, they cannot be confirmed.
3. The Gleason grade is not reported, and given the noisy nature of the material and the need for additional QC, it is not possible to determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, I set it to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."
