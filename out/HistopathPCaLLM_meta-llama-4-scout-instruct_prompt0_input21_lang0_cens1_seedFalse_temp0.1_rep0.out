Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor finding or a specific Gleason grade, and the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, I will make educated inferences based on the content.

Given the context, the sample type seems to be a biopsy, as it's mentioned that "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments...of which about half been put to histology," which aligns with a biopsy procedure.

The presence of malignant tumor findings is not clearly stated; in fact, the statement highlights significant technical issues with the material ("the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns"), suggesting that an assessment of malignancy might not be conclusively made.

The Gleason grade, which is a system of grading prostate cancer tissue based on how it looks under a microscope, cannot be determined from the statement due to the mentioned technical issues and the recommendation for additional QC.

Therefore, based on the information given and the constraints of the task:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This structured data reflects the ambiguity and lack of specific information regarding the malignancy and Gleason grade in the provided statement.
