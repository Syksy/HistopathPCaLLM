Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor finding or a specific Gleason grade, and the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, I will make educated inferences based on the content.

Given the context, the sample type seems to be a biopsy, as it's mentioned that "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments... of which about half been put to histology," which is a common procedure for biopsy samples.

The presence of "carpet-like growth" could suggest a tumor, but the statement also mentions that "the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns," which makes it difficult to conclusively determine malignancy or assess the Gleason grade. However, there's no clear indication of a malignant tumor finding in the provided text, and the mention of technical issues and the need for additional QC suggests that the pathologists were unable to make a definitive assessment.

Therefore, I will structure the data as follows:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This conclusion is based on:
- The sample type being most likely a biopsy due to the description of the material and process.
- The lack of clear evidence for malignant tumor findings, given the technical difficulties and the description provided.
- The Gleason grade being not assessable (NA) due to the technical issues and the inconclusive nature of the findings.
