Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor finding or a specific Gleason grade, and the sample type is not explicitly mentioned, I will make educated inferences based on the content.

Given that the material is described as "prostate material" and the context, I can infer the sample type is likely a biopsy, but since it's not explicitly stated and there's no clear indication of it being an RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), and given the mention of "extracted prostate material," I will cautiously classify it.

The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings due to technical issues with the material ("nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns"). Therefore, I will have to classify the malignant tumor findings as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the assessment.

Similarly, there's no reported Gleason grade due to the assessment issues mentioned.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Raw data provided for context (not used directly in the algorithm but given for understanding):
"The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."
