Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate thick needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "malignant tumor findings" on the left side, specifically "low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures", which indicates a "yes" for malignant tumor findings.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which I interpreted as a Gleason grade of "3+4=7". 

Note that I only considered the results from the most severe lesion, which in this case is the left side. The right side is reported as not exhibiting signs of malignancies, but this does not affect the overall result.
