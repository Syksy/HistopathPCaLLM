To solve this task, we need to analyze the given text and extract the required information according to the specified structured fields. The text provided is:

"A container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both side is inspected, with the left side fragments 10 and 7mm in length and right side 15 and 10mm. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4. Furthermore, neural bundles appear surrounded by cancerous growth. The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies."

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy.

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The text states that the left side fragments "exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," which means there are malignant tumor findings. It also mentions that "The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies." Since we are only interested in the results from the most severe lesion and there's a clear mention of malignancy on the left side, we consider this as a positive finding for malignancy.

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: For the left side, it mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4. The Gleason grading system often reports a major and minor grade (e.g., 3+4). The sum of these scores can also be provided (in this case, 3+4=7). Since the task prefers the format "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements, we can structure this as "3+4=7".

Based on this analysis, here are the structured results in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the required information from the provided text, focusing on the most severe lesion and adhering to the specified format.
