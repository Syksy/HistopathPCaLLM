Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate thick needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "malignant tumor findings" on the left side, specifically "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth", so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which I combined into a single string "3+4=7", following the preferred format.

Note that I ignored the information about the right side, as the task specifies that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned. Also, I did not include any information about chronic inflammation, as it is not relevant to the requested structured fields.
