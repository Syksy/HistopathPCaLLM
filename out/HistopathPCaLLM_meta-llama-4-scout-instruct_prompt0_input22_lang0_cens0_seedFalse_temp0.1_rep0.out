To solve this task, we need to parse the given text and extract the required information according to the specified structured fields. The text provided is:

"A container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both side is inspected, with the left side fragments 10 and 7mm in length and right side 15 and 10mm. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4. Furthermore, neural bundles appear surrounded by cancerous growth. The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies."

Here's how we can extract the necessary information:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates that the original sample type is a "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The text states that the left side fragments "exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," which means there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: For the left side, it mentions "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." The Gleason score is often reported as a sum of the two most prevalent grades (e.g., 3+4=7). Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the malignant findings is "3+4=7."

Since we are only interested in the results from the most severe lesion and the left side exhibits malignancy while the right side does not, we focus on the left side's findings.

The structured result in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This JSON object provides the required structured data based on the given histopathological statement.
