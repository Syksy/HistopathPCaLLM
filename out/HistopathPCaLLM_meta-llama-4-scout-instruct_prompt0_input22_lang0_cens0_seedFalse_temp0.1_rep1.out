To solve this task, we need to parse the given text and extract the required information according to the specified structured fields. The text provided is:

"A container of prostate thick needle biopsies from both side is inspected, with the left side fragments 10 and 7mm in length and right side 15 and 10mm. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4. Furthermore, neural bundles appear surrounded by cancerous growth. The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies."

Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Original Sample Type**: The text mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies," which indicates the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the answer to the first question is "biopsy."

2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The text states that the "Left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures," which indicates there are malignant tumor findings on the left side. It also mentions that "The fragmented samples from the right side do not exhibit signs of malignancies." Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion and there are malignant findings, the answer to the second question is "yes."

3. **Reported Gleason Grade**: For the left side, it mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4. The Gleason grading system often reports a major and minor grade (e.g., 3+4). The sum is also sometimes provided (3+4=7). Since the task prefers the format "major+minor=sum" and given that the most severe lesion is described with scores 3 and 4, we interpret this as 3+4=7. Therefore, the answer to the third question is "3+4=7."

Given these interpretations, the structured result in valid JSON format is:

```json
{
  "sampleType": "biopsy",
  "malignantTumorFindings": "yes",
  "gleasonGrade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information extracted from the provided text according to the specified requirements.
