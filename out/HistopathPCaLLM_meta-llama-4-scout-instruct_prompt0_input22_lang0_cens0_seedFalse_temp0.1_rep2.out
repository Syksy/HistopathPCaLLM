Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate thick needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "malignant tumor findings" on the left side, with "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth", so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4", which I interpreted as a Gleason grade of "3+4=7". 

Note that I ignored the information about the right side, as the task is to report the results from the most severe lesion, which appears to be on the left side. Also, I did not include any nested structures in the result.
