Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions a "container of prostate tissue sampling material" and "fragments" of tissue.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the text explicitly states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and that there is "chronic inflammation" but no clear indication of cancer.
3. The reported Gleason grade is "NA", as the text mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and that the samples need to be reprocessed.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"A container of prostate tissue sampling material was inspected, with fragmentation to lengths 10 and 7mm in sample material originating from the left side and 15 and 10mm from the right side. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentation types. Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult, and proof-checking ought to be conducted that the material truly originates from prostate and the conservation of samples has not been contaminated by e.g. bacterial agent. As it is, the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed."
