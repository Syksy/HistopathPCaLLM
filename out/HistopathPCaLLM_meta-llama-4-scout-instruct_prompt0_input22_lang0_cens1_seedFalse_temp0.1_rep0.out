Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions a "container of prostate tissue sampling material" and "fragments" from the left and right sides, which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the text explicitly states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and that there are "chronic inflammation" and a "wide range of cell differentiation types", but no clear indication of malignancy.
3. The reported Gleason grade is "NA", as the text mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is "exceptionally difficult" and that the samples need to be reprocessed, indicating that a Gleason grade could not be determined.
