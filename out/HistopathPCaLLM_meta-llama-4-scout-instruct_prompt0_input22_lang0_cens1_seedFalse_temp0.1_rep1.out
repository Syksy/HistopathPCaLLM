Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions a "container of prostate tissue sampling material" and "fragments" of tissue.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the text explicitly states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and implies that the findings are inconclusive.
3. The reported Gleason grade is not provided, as the text states that assigning a Gleason grade is "exceptionally difficult" and that the samples need to be reprocessed. Therefore, the Gleason grade is considered "NA" (not available).
