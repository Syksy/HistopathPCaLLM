Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the text mentions a "container of prostate tissue sampling material" and "fragments" of tissue.
2. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, as the text states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" and mentions only "chronic inflammation" and a "wide range of cell differentiation types".
3. The Gleason grade cannot be determined, as the text explicitly states that "assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult" and that the samples "need to be reprocessed". Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
