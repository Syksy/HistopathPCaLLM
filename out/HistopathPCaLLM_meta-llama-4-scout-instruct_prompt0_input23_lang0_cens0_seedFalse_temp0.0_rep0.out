Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignant Tumor Findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason Grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5" and provides details about the differentiation stages: "mainly differentiation stage 4 (60%)" and "the second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion)". This information corresponds to a Gleason grade of "4+5=9". 

Note that I ignored the tertiary grade (class 3) as it is mentioned as "diminishingly small" and not significant enough to be included in the Gleason score. Also, I followed the instruction to provide the result in a flat structure with no nesting.
