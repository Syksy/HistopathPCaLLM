Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement reports a Gleason score sum of 9, with a primary grade of 4 (60%), a secondary grade of 5 (30%), and a tertiary grade of 3. The Gleason grade is typically reported as the primary grade + secondary grade = sum. In this case, the Gleason grade is 4+5=9. 

Note that I ignored the tertiary grade (3) as it is not typically included in the main Gleason grade reporting. Also, I used the format "major+minor=sum" as requested.
