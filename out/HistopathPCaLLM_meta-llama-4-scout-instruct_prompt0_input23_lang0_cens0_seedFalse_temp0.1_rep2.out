Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5" and also provides the differentiation stages: "mainly differentiation stage 4 (60%)" and "the second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion)". Based on this, I inferred that the Gleason grade is 4+5=9. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed for further investigation (4 macro sections and the usual microscopic sections), which present an adenocarcinoma spanning from the mid section to the basis. Presents mainly differentation stage 4 (60%). The second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion) represents the poorly differentiated tumor component. Tertiary grade with the least area, class 3, is diminishingly small. The samples do not appear suggest capsule breach or positive margins. CONCLUSION: Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5."
