Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty, so I set it to "NA".
* There are no explicit malignant tumor findings mentioned in the statement, and the text only mentions a suspicion of Gleason 3 findings, but not a confirmed diagnosis, so I set it to "NA".
* The Gleason grade is also not explicitly mentioned as a confirmed result, but rather as a suspicion, so I set it to "NA".

Let me know if you would like me to process the next statement! 

(Raw data for the next statement will be provided, I assume)
