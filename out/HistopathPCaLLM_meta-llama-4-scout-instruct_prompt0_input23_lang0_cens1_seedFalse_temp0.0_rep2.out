Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the sample is being reprocessed, so I couldn't determine the sample type. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" is not conclusive, and the report is incomplete. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
* The Gleason grade is also not conclusively reported, and the statement mentions that the sample needs to be reprocessed to validate initial suspicions. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
