Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+NA=NA"
}
```

However, given that the statement does not provide a conclusive Gleason grade and rather mentions a potential Gleason 3 finding, and that we should only report results from the most severe lesion and not have nested structures, a more accurate response would be:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

But, since Gleason grade is preferably reported as "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements and given that there is a specific mention of potential Gleason 3 findings, it might be more accurate to still report it, assuming the minor is not available:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+NA"
}
```

However, following the format strictly and assuming "NA" for unknown or not applicable:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
