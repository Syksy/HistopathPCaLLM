Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+NA=NA"
}
```

However, given that the statement does not provide a conclusive Gleason grade and rather mentions "potential Gleason 3 findings" and that the sample needs to be reprocessed, a more accurate representation would be:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

This reflects the uncertainty and the need for further investigation as stated in the report. 

Raw data provided is actually missing, if you provide it I can assist further.
