Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "turp-chippings", which corresponds to a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample. Therefore, the value for "sample_type" is set to "TURP".
2. The text explicitly mentions "malignant suspicion" and "adenocarcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4-class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". This corresponds to a Gleason grade of 4+4=8. Therefore, the value for "gleason_grade" is set to "4+4=8". 

Note that I used the format "major+minor=sum" for the Gleason grade, as preferred. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"The sample consists of comfirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings, of which about half are run via 6 tissue casettes. In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth. Some degree of chronically inflammated tissue is also present. SUMMARY: Formerly benignly classified sample with a malignant suspicion had its chippings re-evaluated, now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma."
