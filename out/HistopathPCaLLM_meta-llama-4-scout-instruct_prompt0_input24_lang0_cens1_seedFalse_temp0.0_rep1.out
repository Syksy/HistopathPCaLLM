Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Since the text does not describe a specific patient's sample, but rather a collection of samples used for training purposes, I will assume that the text is describing a set of samples, and I will provide an answer that reflects the information that can be gathered.

Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_type": The text mentions that the samples consisted of biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings, but it does not specify a single sample type for a particular patient. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
* "malignant_tumor_findings": The text states that the material was "post-benign diagnosis" and that the exercise was intended to illustrate inter-observed variation and to train the interns in low-grade scoring settings. This implies that the samples were primarily benign, and only a few cases were upgraded to Gleason 6. Therefore, I set it to "no".
* "gleason_grade": The text mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4, but it does not provide a specific Gleason grade for a particular patient. Since the text implies that the samples were primarily benign, I set it to "NA". 

Please let me know if you would like me to process more text. 

Raw data for testing is appreciated.
