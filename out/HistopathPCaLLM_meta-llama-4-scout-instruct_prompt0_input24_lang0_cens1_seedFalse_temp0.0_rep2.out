Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Since the text does not describe a specific patient's sample, but rather a collection of samples used for training purposes, I will assume that the text is describing a set of samples, and I will provide an answer that reflects the information that can be gathered.

Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as a single value, but rather as a collection of samples that includes biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
* The text mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", which implies that the samples were not expected to show malignant tumor findings. Additionally, it is mentioned that "no upgrading to GG 3 or above" was found, which suggests that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
* The text mentions Gleason scores, but only in the context of upgrading from benign to low-grade scores (e.g., Gleason 3+3 or 3+4). Since the samples were post-benign diagnosis and no malignant tumor findings were reported, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please let me know if you would like me to process more text. 

Raw data for next task will be appreciated.
