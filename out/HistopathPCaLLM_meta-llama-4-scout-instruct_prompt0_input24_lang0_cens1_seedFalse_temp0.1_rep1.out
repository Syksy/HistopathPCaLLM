Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Since the text does not describe a specific patient's sample, but rather a collection of samples used for training purposes, I will assume that the text is describing a set of samples, and I will provide an answer that reflects the information that can be gathered.

Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* The original sample type is not clearly stated for a specific patient, and the text mentions multiple types of samples (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, shavings), so I set it to "NA".
* The text states that the material was "post-benign diagnosis" and that there were "few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6", implying that most cases were benign, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
* Since the text mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 6 (3+3 or 3+4), but this was not a specific patient's result, and most cases were benign, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for a specific patient's sample if you want me to process it.
