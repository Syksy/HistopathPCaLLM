Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Since the text does not describe a specific patient's sample, but rather a collection of samples used for training purposes, I will assume that the text is describing a set of samples, and I will provide an answer that reflects the information that can be gathered.

Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* The original sample type is not clearly stated for a specific patient, and multiple types are mentioned (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, shavings), so I set it to "NA".
* The text mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", and that in some cases, the benign material was upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, but it does not indicate that any of the samples had malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
* The Gleason grade is reported for some cases that were upgraded, but not for the samples as a whole, and the text states that the exercise was with "low grade scoring settings", but since there are no specific malignant findings, I set it to "NA".
