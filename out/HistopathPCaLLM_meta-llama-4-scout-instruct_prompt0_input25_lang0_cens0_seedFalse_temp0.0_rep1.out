Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "tissue cylinders" and multiple "samples", which suggests that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason pattern in samples (1) and (2). For sample (1), the Gleason pattern is 4 (20%) and 3 (30%), and for sample (2), it's 4 (15%) and 3 (less than 35%). Since the question asks for the most severe lesion, I will focus on sample (1) with a higher percentage of Gleason 4 pattern. The Gleason grade is calculated as 4+3=7.

Note that I ignored the information about PIN changes and the benign sample (3), as they are not relevant to the most severe lesion. Also, I used the "major+minor=sum" format for the Gleason grade, as it is the most common and clear way to represent it.
