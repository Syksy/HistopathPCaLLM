Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "tissue cylinders" and multiple "samples", which suggests that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides information about the Gleason pattern for samples (1) and (2). For sample (1), the Gleason pattern is 4 (20%) and 3 (30%). For sample (2), the Gleason pattern is 4 (15%) and 3 (less than 35%). Since the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion, I will focus on sample (1) which has a higher percentage of Gleason 4 pattern. The Gleason grade can be calculated as 4+3=7. Therefore, the value is set to "4+3=7". 

Note that I did not consider the PIN changes or the benign sample (3) when determining the Gleason grade, as the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion.
