Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)", which suggests that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, I assigned the value "biopsy" to this field.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement concludes that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified", which implies that there are no reliable malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I assigned the value "no" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: Since the statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I assigned the value "NA" to this field.

Note that I did not find any information that would suggest a more severe lesion, so I only reported the results based on the provided statement. Also, I did not find any information that would allow me to assign a specific Gleason grade, so I used the value "NA" instead.
