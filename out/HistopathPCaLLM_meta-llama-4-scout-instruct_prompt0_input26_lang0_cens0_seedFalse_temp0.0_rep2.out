Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text explicitly mentions "widely spread tumor", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. `gleason_grade`: The text mentions that the "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent". This suggests that the Gleason grade is a combination of 3 and 4, which is commonly reported as "3+4=7".
