Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text only refers to "material from the prostate" and "samples marked with indices A-C...". Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. The text does not provide a clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the histopathology is compromised due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "NA".
3. The text mentions a clinical note with a possible "Gleason sum 7", but it's unclear if this was verified, and the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"The studied material originates from the prostate, and is processed according to the usual processing procedures and markings. Samples are marked with indices A-C for material attributed to apex and indices D-F for sources closer to basis. Histological inspection reveals that the material from apex and basis is very difficult to assess, due to recent radiation therapy. Clinical notes mention possible 'Gleason sum 7'; however, it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified. Due to the recent RT the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory, and instead assessing spread through the capsule, nearby lymph nodes, or distant mets should be prioritized."
