Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text only refers to "material from the prostate" and "samples marked with indices A-C...". Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. The text does not provide a clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the histopathology is compromised due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "NA".
3. The text mentions a clinical note with a possible "Gleason sum 7", but it's unclear if this was verified or corresponds to a specific Gleason grade. Given the uncertainty and the fact that the histopathology is not reliable due to radiation therapy, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing was not provided in your prompt but I can take it if you provide it for testing with more examples.
