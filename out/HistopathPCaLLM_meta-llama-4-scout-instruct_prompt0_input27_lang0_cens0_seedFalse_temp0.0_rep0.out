Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The sample type is "TURP" because the statement mentions "shavings" and "TURP" is a common procedure associated with prostate shavings.
2. There are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes" because the statement explicitly mentions "Carcinoma" which is a type of malignant tumor.
3. The reported Gleason grade is "3+3=6" because the statement mentions "Gleason 3+3=6" in relation to the malignant tumor findings.

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing: 
"Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes. Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G, where the growth pattern was Gleason 3+3=6."
