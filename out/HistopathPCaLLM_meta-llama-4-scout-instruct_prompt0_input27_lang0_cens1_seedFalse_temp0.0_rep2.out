Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the growth patterns in most samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation, but it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. The mention of a possible Gleason score of 3 in small quantities is not sufficient to indicate a malignant tumor finding, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as possibly 3, but since the statement is not conclusive about the presence of a malignant tumor, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for further processing. I'm ready to help with the next statement! 

However, I noticed you requested to have a result in a form like  "major+minor=sum", I will keep that in mind for a case where actual scores are reported for confirmed malignant tumors. 

If you are ready, please go ahead and provide the next statement to process.
