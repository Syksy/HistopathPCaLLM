Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "six biopsy cylinders", so I inferred that the sample type is "biopsy".
2. The text explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and Gleason classification, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so I set this field to "yes".
3. The text states that the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with a Gleason point sum of 8, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 4+4=8. I used this value for the Gleason grade field.

Note that I ignored the other Gleason grades mentioned in the text (4+3=7 and 3+4=7) since the problem statement asks for the results from the most severe lesion, which is the one with a Gleason grade of 4+4=8.
