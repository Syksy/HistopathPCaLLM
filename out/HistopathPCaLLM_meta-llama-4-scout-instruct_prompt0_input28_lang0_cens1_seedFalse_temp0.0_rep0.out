Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "six different sites of interest, inspected due to the elevated PSA status of the patient" and "material is sent to pathologist XYZ for further evaluation", which suggests that the sample is a biopsy.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text describes "atypical growth patterns", "odd growth patterns", and "possible pre-malignant changes", but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I return "NA".
