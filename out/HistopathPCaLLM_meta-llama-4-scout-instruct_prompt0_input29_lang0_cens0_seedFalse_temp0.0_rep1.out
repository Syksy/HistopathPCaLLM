Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions that the "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes the sampling process, which suggests that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text explicitly states that "invasive adenocarcinoma is observed" in the left lobe, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that the "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections" and describes the tumor as having "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 3". This information is consistent with a Gleason grade of 4+3=7.
