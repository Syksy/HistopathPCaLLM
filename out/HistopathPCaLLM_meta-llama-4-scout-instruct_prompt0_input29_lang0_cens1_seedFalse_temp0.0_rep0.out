Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", so it's classified as "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the text suggests that the samples were not properly assessed, so it's classified as "NA".
3. The Gleason grade is not reported, and the text explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible", so it's classified as "NA".

Raw data for testing was: 
"Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request. Samples were taken as follows: A - left lower, B - right lower, and then C - left middle, D - right middle, and then E - left higher, F - right higher. From sample indices A and C non-prostatic tissue is observed, which suggests that the sampling procedure had something that was contaminated. Capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed, as these samples A and C were of particular interest. Colleague had requested particularly the assessment of potential poor differentiation and possible fusing grandular structure observations arising from the said samples, which remains to be re-examined in further sampling. SUMMARY: Score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined."
