Based on the provided text, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other specific type, so it's classified as "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the text mentions that the samples were not properly assessed and need to be re-examined. Therefore, it's classified as "NA".
3. The Gleason grade is not reported, and the text explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible", so it's classified as "NA".
