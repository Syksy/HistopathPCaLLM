Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as a "prostatectomy specimen", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The text explicitly states that there are no malignant tumor findings, with phrases such as "no abnormal growth", "no tumor growth", and "most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I have returned "NA" (Not Available).
