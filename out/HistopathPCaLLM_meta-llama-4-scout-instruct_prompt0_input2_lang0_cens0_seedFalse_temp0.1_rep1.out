Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as a "prostatectomy specimen", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The text explicitly states that there are no malignant tumor findings, with phrases such as "no abnormal growth", "no tumor growth", and "most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I have returned "NA" (Not Available).

Raw data used for this example: 

"The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen, with a total weight 44g. Outer dimensions are approx 5*4*3 cm without the vehicles. Three macrosections and standard routine microsections are ordered. The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use. Black marker colour is applied dorsally, right section in yellow, and left section in green. Microscopically all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth. Some atrophy and spot-like inflammation is found, along with growth suggestive of hyperplasia. The resection are surfaces are confirmed to be clean, the capsule is showing no abnormal growth, and seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth. SUMMARY: Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging."
