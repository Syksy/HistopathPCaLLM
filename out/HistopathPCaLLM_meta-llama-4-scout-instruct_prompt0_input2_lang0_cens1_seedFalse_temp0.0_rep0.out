Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the sample is an autopsy specimen, so I couldn't determine the sample type. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
2. The text mentions that the sample exhibits "inflammatory and age-related changes" and that "Further inspection and sample re-runs are required" to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. This implies that no malignant tumor findings were observed, or at least not conclusively. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use. Dimension(s) of the sample are sufficient for inspection of the sample material, from which multiple macro/microsections are ordered. Standard marker colours are applied to inspect various characteristics of the sample material. Microscopic inspection of the sections reveal various types of cell growth. Some atrophy and inflammation can be observed across the material. Further findings cannot be reliable inferred, due to inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples. SUMMARY: Further inspection and sample re-runs are required, as currently the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue that do exhibit inflammatory and age-related changes."
