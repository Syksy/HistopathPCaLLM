Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the sample is an autopsy specimen, so I couldn't determine the sample type. Therefore, I set it to "NA".
2. The text mentions that there are "inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples" and that it's difficult to infer further findings. However, it does mention the possibility of "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes", but it's not a definitive finding. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no definitive malignant tumor findings, I set the "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please let me know if you agree with my interpretation or if you'd like me to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the raw data for other statements so I can practice and improve.
