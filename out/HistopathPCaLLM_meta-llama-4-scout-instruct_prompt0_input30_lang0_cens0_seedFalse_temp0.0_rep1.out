Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells", which suggests that the sample type is likely "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text explicitly mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5" and also mentions that the "relatively uncertain diagnosis (3+3) from the patient from before should be updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1)". This suggests that the Gleason grade is 3+3=6. 

Note that I have followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures. Let me know if you have any further questions! 

Raw data used for this example: 

APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Cells had shown a lot of atrophy and possibly some atypical patterns, but the notable amount of burn artefacts on the histological slides made interpretation difficult. Basal cell structures were also observed. JD & JD both confirmed that the samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells do show a diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5. The relatively uncertain diagnosis (3+3) from the patient from before should be updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1). The patient should be contacted to discuss further options.
