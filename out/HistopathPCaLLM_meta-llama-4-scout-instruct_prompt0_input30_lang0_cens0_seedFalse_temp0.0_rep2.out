Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+3=6"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells", which suggests that the sample type is likely "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text explicitly mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5" and also mentions that the Gleason grade should be updated to "Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1". The Gleason grade is reported as "3+3" (which equals 6), so I used this value for the structured result.
