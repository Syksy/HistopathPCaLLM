Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not mentioned in the statement, so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the consultants "could not confirm or deny the suspicions" of atypical findings, and therefore, the uncertain diagnosis "could not be determined". This implies that there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer is "NA".
