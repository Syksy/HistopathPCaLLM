Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions that the patient underwent a "biopsy" (and multiple targeted biopsies), so the original sample type is indeed "biopsy".
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text describes a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" and a "second most common differentiation pattern is 5", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. `gleason_grade`: The text reports a Gleason grade of "4+5=9" for the most severe lesion, which is higher than the initial Gleason sum 6. Note that I used the information from the second targeted biopsy, which is the most severe lesion.

Let me know if this meets your requirements!
