Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions that the patient underwent a "biopsy" (and multiple targeted biopsies), so the original sample type is indeed "biopsy".
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text describes a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" and a "second most common differentiation pattern is 5", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. `gleason_grade`: The text reports a Gleason grade of "4+5=9" for the most severe lesion, which is higher than the initial Gleason sum 6. This is the grade I reported in the structured data. 

Note that I ignored the initial Gleason sum 6 and focused on the more severe lesion described later in the text, as per your instructions. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"The patient had undergone routine systematic biopsy, where only a minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6 was found. This led to active surveillance. However, the patient has since developed active symptons, and PSA levels have elevated rapidly (latest value already >100). This led to two targeted biopsies done using imaging for guidance. In the first targeted biopsy there was a technical failure resulting in loss of the material, but the second targeted biopsy hit a large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4. The patient had already started radiotherapy, which made interpretation of the cell morphological changes difficult. However, it would strongly appear that the second most common differentiation pattern is 5. The novel findings confirm that the previous Gleason sum 6 did not capture the most aggressive tumor characteristics. The patient treatment plan has already been updated based on the new findings."
