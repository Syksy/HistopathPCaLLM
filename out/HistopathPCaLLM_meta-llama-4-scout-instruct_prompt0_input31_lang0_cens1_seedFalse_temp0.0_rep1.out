Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and return it in a structured JSON format.

After analyzing the statement, I conclude that:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA".
2. There were suspicious findings, but it's not clear if they are malignant. However, the statement mentions "suspicious findings" and "malignant" is not explicitly ruled out, so I will assume "yes" for the presence of malignant tumor findings, but keep in mind that this is an educated guess.
3. The Gleason grade is not mentioned at all, so I will default to "NA".

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

However, I must emphasize that the statement is quite ambiguous, and a more accurate answer might require additional context or information.

Now, I will wait for the raw data to be provided, as mentioned at the end of the instructions. Please provide the raw data, and I will be happy to help. 

Please go ahead and provide the raw data. I will generate structured data based on the provided text.
