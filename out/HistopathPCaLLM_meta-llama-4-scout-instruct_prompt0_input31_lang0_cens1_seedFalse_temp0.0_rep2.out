Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and return it in a structured JSON format.

After analyzing the statement, I conclude that:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will assign "NA" to this field.
2. There were suspicious findings, but it's not explicitly stated that they are malignant. However, the fact that additional samples and treatment planning are needed implies that the findings might be serious. I will cautiously assign "yes" to this field, but note that the text is not entirely clear.
3. The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement, so I will assign "NA" to this field.

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the next statement.

Raw data will be provided later, I assume. Please go ahead and provide it. I'll be happy to help. 

However, I can also note that based on current information no changes are required for this response as per current input there is no change required.
