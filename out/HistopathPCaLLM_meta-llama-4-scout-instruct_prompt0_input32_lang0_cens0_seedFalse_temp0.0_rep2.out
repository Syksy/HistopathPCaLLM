Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to "RP".
2. The text explicitly mentions "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate", indicating that there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason 4+4 pattern" among others, and since we only need to report the most severe lesion, I extracted the highest Gleason grade mentioned, which is "4+4=8". 

Note that I ignored the findings from the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, as they are not relevant to the original prostate cancer histopathological statement. Also, I only reported the most severe Gleason grade, as per the instructions.
