Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the sample is from the primary prostate tissue, but the type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified, so it's "NA".
* The statement mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, and there is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the provided text, so it's "no".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade in the provided text, so it's "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'm ready to process it.
