Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty, so it is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, and there is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the provided text, so it is set to "no".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade in the provided text, so it is set to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. 

However, I can also make an educated guess for sample type as "RP"  ( Radical Prostatectomy)  as prostate tissue is mentioned,  if I had to make an educated guess then 

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
