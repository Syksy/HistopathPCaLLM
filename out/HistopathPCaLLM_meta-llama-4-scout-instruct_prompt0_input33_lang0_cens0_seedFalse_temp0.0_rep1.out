Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "Radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP".
2. The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and "malignant findings", indicating that there are indeed malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason types 3+4/4+3", but since we only need to report the most severe lesion, I took the highest grade, which is 3+4=7. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Radical prostatectomy preparate started normally according to protocol. On the edges of the capsule, growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3. Tumor has penetrated the capsule (estimate T3b). View specific information from the additional details of the report. One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes in processed macro sections. No malignant findings in seminal vehicles."
