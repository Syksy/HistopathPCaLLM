Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Since the statement does not provide specific details about the sample type, malignant tumor findings, or Gleason grade, I will use the allowed values to provide the most accurate answer.

Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* The sample type is not mentioned in the statement, so I used "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes", but it does not indicate a malignant tumor finding in the context of prostate cancer histopathology, so I used "no".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for prostate cancer histopathology, so I used "NA".
