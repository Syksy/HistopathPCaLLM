Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be "RP" (Resection Prostate) based on the phrase "The presented sample is a resection".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no malignities" and "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing: 
"The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr. Histologically glands can be seen very close to each other, partial cribriform structures noted. Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma. Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen, but no malignities."
