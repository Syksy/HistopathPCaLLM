Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be "RP" (Resection Prostate) based on the phrase "The presented sample is a resection".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no malignities" and "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
