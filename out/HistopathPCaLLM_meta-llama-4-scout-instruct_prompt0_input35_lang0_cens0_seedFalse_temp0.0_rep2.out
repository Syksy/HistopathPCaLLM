Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "representative prostate biopsies".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as indicated by "No signs of carcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since there were no malignant tumor findings.

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing is appreciated.
