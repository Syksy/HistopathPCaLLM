Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "Samples are from left and right lobe", which implies a biopsy sample type. I assumed "biopsy" as the sample type, although it's not explicitly mentioned.
2. The statement mentions "No perineural invasion" and "some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia", but no explicit mention of malignant tumor findings. However, it does mention "high-grade PIN-changes", which is a precursor to cancer, but not cancer itself. Therefore, I concluded that there are no malignant tumor findings, and set it to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I set it to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything! 

Now, I'm ready to process the raw data provided at the end of the instructions. Please go ahead and provide it.
