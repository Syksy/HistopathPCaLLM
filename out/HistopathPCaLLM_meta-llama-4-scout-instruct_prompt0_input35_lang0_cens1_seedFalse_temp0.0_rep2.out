Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The statement doesn't explicitly mention the sample type, but based on the content, it seems likely that the sample is from a biopsy. Therefore, I assume the sample type is "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" but does not indicate a malignant tumor finding. It also mentions "hyperplasia", which is a benign condition. Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, and the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer is "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the raw data provided. 

Also, please provide the raw data as mentioned in the instructions. I'll be happy to work with it. 

However, I can also work with just the statement if that is what is expected. 

Let me know how I can assist you further. 

If you are ready to provide more statements I can assist you with those as well. 

I'm ready when you are.
