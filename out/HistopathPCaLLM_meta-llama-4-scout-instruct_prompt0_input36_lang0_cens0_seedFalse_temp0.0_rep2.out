Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is not mentioned, so it's classified as "NA".
2. The statement explicitly says "No signs of malignity", so the answer is "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's classified as "NA".
