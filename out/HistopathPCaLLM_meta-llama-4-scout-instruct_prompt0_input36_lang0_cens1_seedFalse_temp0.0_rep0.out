Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but based on the context of preparing macro and regular cassettes, it is likely a biopsy. Since other options like RP (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) typically have more specific mentions, "biopsy" seems a reasonable assumption.
* The statement mentions "macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia", but there is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "no".
* There is no mention of Gleason grading, which is typically used for prostate cancer assessment. Therefore, "gleason_grade" is set to "NA".
