Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but based on the context of preparing macro and regular cassettes, it is likely a biopsy. Since other types (RP, TURP) are not mentioned and "biopsy" is a common sample type for such procedures, I assumed it to be "biopsy".
* The statement mentions "macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia", but there is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so I concluded that "malignant_tumor_findings" is "no".
* Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for further processing. 

However, note that in real-life applications, a more sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach or a set of predefined rules based on the statement's content would be required to accurately determine the structured data. 

If you provide more data or statements, I can assist you further. 

Also, if you provide more context about what "NA" stands for (for instance, if it is an abbreviation that could be written out in full), that would be helpful. 

If you want, I can also make educated guesses based on general knowledge. 

For now, I provided what I could deduce based on general knowledge. 

If there are any changes that you would like me to make, please let me know. 

The next statement can be processed upon request.
