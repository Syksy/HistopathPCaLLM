Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "electrosection chippings" which is a characteristic method for TURP procedures.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Findings indicate hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
