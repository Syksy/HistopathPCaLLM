Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation in places", but does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA".

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'm ready to process it! 

However, I can also confirm that I have understood the requirements as follows 

- I will only be providing 3 fields 
- malignant_tumor_findings and  Gleason grade  will have  "yes" , "no"  and  "NA" or a number  based response 
- I will not provide any nested structures. 

Let me know if I can proceed with the next statement!
