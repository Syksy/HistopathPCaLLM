Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "needle biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No suspected malignity", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
