Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation", but no malignant tumor findings are reported, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA".

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements!
