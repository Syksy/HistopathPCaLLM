Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The text explicitly mentions a "tumor" with "positive marginal" and "Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages", indicating malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 3 (major) and 4 (minor), which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"A prostatectomy preparate under investigation weighing 85 g. 7 macrosections extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic sections reveal a tumor with 3 foci. In these areas a positive marginal was seen in an area of approx 1.5mm. Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages in these foci, therefore Gleason grade is 7. No penetrative growth through the capsule or seminal vesicle invasion."
