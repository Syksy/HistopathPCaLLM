Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it is not clear whether there are benign hyperplasia or malignant findings, but it implies that no malignant findings were confirmed, so I set "malignant_findings" to "no".
3. The Gleason score cannot be assessed, so I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'm ready to process it! 

However, I can also make a small amendment to make sure that I handle it according to your original instructions that I only return data if I am certain. Here is a minor change:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
