Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is determined to be "TURP" since the statement mentions "prostate chippings", which is a common sample type for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedures.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
