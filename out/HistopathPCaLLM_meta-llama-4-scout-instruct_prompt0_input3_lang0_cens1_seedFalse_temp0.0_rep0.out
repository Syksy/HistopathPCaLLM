Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run", implying that no malignant tumor findings were confirmed. Additionally, it only mentions inflammation and burn artefacts, but no malignant features. Therefore, the value is set to "no".
3. Since no conclusive findings were made and there is no mention of a Gleason grade, the value is set to "NA".
