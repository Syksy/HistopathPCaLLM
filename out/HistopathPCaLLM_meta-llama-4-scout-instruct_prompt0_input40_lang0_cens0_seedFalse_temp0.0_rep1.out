Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "shaving material" and "approx 5g set on eight casettes", which is consistent with a TURP procedure.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth", which indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the statement concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia" and there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
