Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as indicated by the mention of "casettes" ( likely referring to tissue cassette) and the context of the examination.
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, and the statement explicitly mentions "at least hyperplastic prostate" and "inflammation", but not cancer. Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, and the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I return "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the next statement! 

Also, please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'm ready to process it!
