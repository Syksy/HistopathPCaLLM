Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate", which implies a biopsy procedure. Therefore, I inferred the sample type as "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were confirmed. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since no malignant tumor findings were confirmed, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'll be happy to help!
