Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "RP" (prostatectomy) based on the term "Prostatectomy preparate" in the statement.
2. There are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7", which is in the desired format. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g invastigated. Almost exclusively seen Gleason grade 4 differentiation, mostly in a small part of combined glands. Small amount of Gleason 3. Summary: score 7 (4+3)."
