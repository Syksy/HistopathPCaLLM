Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "RP" (prostatectomy) based on the term "Prostatectomy preparate".
2. There are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7", which is in the required format. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data will be provided later, I'm ready when you are!
