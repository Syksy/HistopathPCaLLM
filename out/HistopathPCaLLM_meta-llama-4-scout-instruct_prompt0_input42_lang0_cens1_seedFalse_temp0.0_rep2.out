Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it cannot be determined whether it is cancer or inflammation, but it does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, so it's classified as "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process the raw data provided at the end of the instructions. I didn't see any raw data in your message, though. Please provide it if you'd like me to process it.
