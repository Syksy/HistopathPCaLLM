Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "prostate chippings" and "Material run in cassettes".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as stated explicitly: "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since the statement indicates no malignant tumor findings.
