Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the mention of "prostate chippings" and "Material run in cassettes".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as stated explicitly: "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma".
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since there were no malignant tumor findings.

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing: 
"Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar. Only ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material."
