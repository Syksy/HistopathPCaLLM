Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "prostate samples" and "Material is placed in cassettes and in the jar", which is a common procedure for biopsy samples. Therefore, "sample_type" is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached", implying that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "malignant_tumor_findings" is set to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, "gleason_grade" is set to "NA".
