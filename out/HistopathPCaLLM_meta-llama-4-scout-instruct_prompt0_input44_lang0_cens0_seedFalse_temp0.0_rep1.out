Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" because the statement mentions "Representative prostate biopsies".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no" because the statement says "now no tumor tissue can be seen" and "Nothing suspicious".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement indicates that no tumor tissue was found, making it a benign statement.

Raw data for testing purposes: 
 Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine. Normally structured prostate tissue with varying gland sizes seen under microscope. Little chronic inflamation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious. Summary: Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen.
