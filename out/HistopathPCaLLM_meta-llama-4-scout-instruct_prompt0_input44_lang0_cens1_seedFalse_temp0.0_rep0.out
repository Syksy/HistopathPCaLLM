Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings in this specific sample. However, it's noted that earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer, but that's not relevant to this specific sample. So, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
 Representative prostate samples according to standard routine. Normally structured prostate tissue with varying gland size seen under microscope. Little chronic inflamation and in some places atrophy. Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes. Note: Earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer.
