Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The statement mentions "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample", which indicates that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP).
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement describes a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "malignant" features such as perineural invasion, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement mentions "classes 3+4" and "tissue gleason 3", but the most specific and severe Gleason grade mentioned is "3+4". I assume that the "=7" is implied, but I will keep it in the format you requested. If I had to choose a single value, I would use "3+4=7". Since the tumor is malignant, I will not use "NA".
