Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is inferred as "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "Shaved prostate chippings" and "Material was set on eight cassettes", which is consistent with the TURP procedure.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material", which indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer is "NA".
