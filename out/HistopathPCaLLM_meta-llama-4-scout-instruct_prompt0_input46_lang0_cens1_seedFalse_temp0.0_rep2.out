Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the statement mentions "Prostate material total size around 2x" and "Material was set on cassettes, smaller portion of material was run", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the findings "might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia" and that it's "Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not", which suggests that there are no clear malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no clear malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I set it to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should proceed with the raw data provided. I don't see the raw data in this prompt, though!
