Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as stated "No malign findings on the left or the right", so the answer is "no".
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since there were no malignant findings. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left. Total length of biopsies is roughly 3+4=7 cm. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a little lymfocytic accumulation that would indicate slight chronic inflammation. No malign findings on the left or the right."
