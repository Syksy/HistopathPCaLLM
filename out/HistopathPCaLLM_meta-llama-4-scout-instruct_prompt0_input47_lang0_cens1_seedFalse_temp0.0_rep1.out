Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The sample type appears to be a biopsy, as the statement mentions "Examined sample material" and doesn't specify a more specific type like RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate).
2. The statement explicitly mentions that it's "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings" which implies that no malignant tumor findings were identified, so I set this to "no".
3. Since there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set this to "NA". 

Please let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a bit of lymphocytic accumulation that would indicate chronic inflammation. Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right."
