Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate resection", which corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and "malignant tumor", so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades of the two tumor foci. The most severe lesion has a Gleason grade of 5 (>80%) and a smaller portion of Gleason 4, and the summary states a Gleason 9 tumor. Therefore, the structured result is "4+5=9".
