Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The text does not specify the sample type, and it appears to be a collection of samples from multiple autopsies, so I couldn't determine the original sample type. Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. The text mentions that there are "some interesting findings", but it explicitly states that the sample is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e., Gleason scores), and there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. The text explicitly states that the sample is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e., Gleason scores), which implies that there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA".
