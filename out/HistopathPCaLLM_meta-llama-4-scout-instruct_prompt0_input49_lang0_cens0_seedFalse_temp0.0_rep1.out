To solve this task, let's analyze the given statement and extract the required information step by step:

1. **Original sample type**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings," which implies a procedure that involves removing or cutting pieces of the prostate. This description aligns most closely with a **TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate)** procedure, which is a surgical procedure used to treat urinary problems caused by an enlarged prostate. TURP involves removing pieces of the prostate that are blocking urine flow.

2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma," which directly indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings.

3. **Reported Gleason grade**: The statement provides information on the Gleason grading: "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." The Gleason grading system is used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer based on how much the cancer cells look like normal cells when viewed under a microscope. The system assigns a grade from 1 to 5 to each of the two most prevalent patterns of cell growth, then adds them together for a total score. In this case, the most severe or significant patterns are Gleason 3 and 4, so the Gleason grade would be reported as "3+4=7."

Given this analysis, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "3+4=7"
}
```

This structured data reflects the information extracted from the provided statement, adhering to the specified format and content requirements.
