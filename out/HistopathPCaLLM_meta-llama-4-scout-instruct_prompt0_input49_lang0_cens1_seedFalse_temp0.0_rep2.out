Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and return it in a structured JSON format.

Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses", which implies that the sample type is likely a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) sample, as it's referring to the "rest of the prostate samples".
2. The statement does not mention any malignant tumor findings, and in fact, mentions that the changes found "warrant further investigation", implying that no conclusive malignant findings were made. Therefore, I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I set it to "NA".
