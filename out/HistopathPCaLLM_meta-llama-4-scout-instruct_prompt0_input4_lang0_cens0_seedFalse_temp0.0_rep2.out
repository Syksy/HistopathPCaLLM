Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", so the answer is "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the samples do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
