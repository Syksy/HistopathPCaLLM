Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be a "biopsy" since the statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and "sampled tissue".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings mentioned, as the statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present" and it's not possible to "reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes". Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. The reported Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since the sample is not malignant and no Gleason grade is mentioned.
