Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be a "biopsy" since the statement mentions "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations" and "sampled tissue".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings mentioned, as the statement says "no notable atypic patterns are present" and it's not possible to "reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes". Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. The reported Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since the sample is benign and there's no mention of a malignant tumor. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
 Several sampling sites are available from standard locations. One sample part appears to be not representative, as it contains no prostate tissue. Otherwise the sampled tissue appears representative of prostate tissue. While no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue, the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes.
