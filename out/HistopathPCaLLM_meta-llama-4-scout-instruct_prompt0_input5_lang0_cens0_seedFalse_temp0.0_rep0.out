Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to "RP".
2. The text explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and "malignant" growth patterns, indicating that there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported for the most severe lesion, which is in macro B with a growth pattern of "4+5" and a sum of "9". I used the more severe lesion's Gleason grade as per the instructions.

Let me know if this is correct! 

Raw data used: 

The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy, with the weight of prostate 50g. Left section is run in yellow and right section in green. Apex is longitudinally inserted into macroblocks A & B. Cross sections from the basis as C-E and longitudinal from left to right as F-H. Left seminal vehicle into block I and right into block J. Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, with the dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. In macro B higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5, with the proportions approx 50% and 20%. Other prostate macroblocks are clean along with the seminal vehicles. No penetration of the prostate capsule or perineural invasion is observed.
