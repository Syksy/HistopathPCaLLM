Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and growth patterns, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported for the most severe lesion, which is in macro B with a grade of "4+5=9". I extracted the major and minor grades and calculated the sum, which is a common way to report Gleason grades.

Note that I ignored the other details in the statement, such as the weight of the prostate, section colors, and block designations, as they are not relevant to the requested structured fields. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy, with the weight of prostate 50g. Left section is run in yellow and right section in green. Apex is longitudinally inserted into macroblocks A & B. Cross sections from the basis as C-E and longitudinal from left to right as F-H. Left seminal vehicle into block I and right into block J. Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, with the dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. In macro B higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5, with the proportions approx 50% and 20%. Other prostate macroblocks are clean along with the seminal vehicles. No penetration of the prostate capsule or perineural invasion is observed."
