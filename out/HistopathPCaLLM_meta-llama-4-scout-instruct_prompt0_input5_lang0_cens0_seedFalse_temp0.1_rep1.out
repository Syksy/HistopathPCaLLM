Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text explicitly states "Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed", which indicates a malignant tumor finding, so the value is "yes".
3. `gleason_grade`: The text reports two different Gleason grades: "4+3" and "4+5=9". Since we only need to return the results from the most severe lesion, I chose the higher grade, which is "4+5=9". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more data! 

Raw data used for this example: 

The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy, with the weight of prostate 50g. Left section is run in yellow and right section in green. Apex is longitudinally inserted into macroblocks A & B. Cross sections from the basis as C-E and longitudinal from left to right as F-H. Left seminal vehicle into block I and right into block J. Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, with the dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. In macro B higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5, with the proportions approx 50% and 20%. Other prostate macroblocks are clean along with the seminal vehicles. No penetration of the prostate capsule or perineural invasion is observed.
