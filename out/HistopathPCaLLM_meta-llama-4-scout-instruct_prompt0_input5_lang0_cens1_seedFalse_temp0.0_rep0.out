Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. **sample_type**: The text mentions "Samples taken from both apex and basis" and "sections from the left" and "sections from right", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The text states that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were observed. Therefore, the value is "no".
3. **gleason_grade**: The text mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred", which suggests that the Gleason grade could not be determined. Therefore, the value is "NA".
