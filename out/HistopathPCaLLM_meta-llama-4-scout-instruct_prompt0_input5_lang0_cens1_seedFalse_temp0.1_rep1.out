Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "samples taken from both apex and basis" and "sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text states that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings" and "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred", which suggests that there are no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I have returned "NA".
