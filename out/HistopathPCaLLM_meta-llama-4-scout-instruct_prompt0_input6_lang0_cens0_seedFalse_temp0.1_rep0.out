Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue casettes", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes the microscopic findings as "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia". There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so I classified this as "no".
3. **Gleason grade**: Since the statement indicates a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) and no malignant tumor findings, I classified the Gleason grade as "NA".
