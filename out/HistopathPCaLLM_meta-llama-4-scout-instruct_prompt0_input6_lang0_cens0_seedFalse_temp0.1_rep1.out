Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and "TURP" is a common medical procedure associated with such samples. Given the context, I inferred that the sample type is likely "TURP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The statement describes the microscopic findings as "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and suggests that the specimen is presenting with "benign prostate hyperplasia". There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so I set this field to "no".
3. **Gleason grade**: Since the statement indicates a benign condition and no malignant tumor findings, I set the Gleason grade to "NA".
