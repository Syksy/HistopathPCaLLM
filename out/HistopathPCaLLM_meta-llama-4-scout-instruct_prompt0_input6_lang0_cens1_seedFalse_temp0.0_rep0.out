Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a prostate operation, which is most likely a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" and that "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed", which suggests that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
3. Since the results are inconclusive and there are no clear malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not reported, so I set it to "NA".
