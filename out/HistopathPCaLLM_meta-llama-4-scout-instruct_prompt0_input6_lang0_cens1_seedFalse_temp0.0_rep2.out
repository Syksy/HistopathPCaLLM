Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is inferred to be "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) since the statement mentions "the original prostatic operation material".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings mentioned in the statement, and the results are described as "inconclusive" due to technical challenges. Therefore, I have marked it as "no" for malignant tumor findings, but it could also be argued as "NA" due to the inconclusive nature of the results. However, given that there is no explicit mention of malignancy, I have chosen "no".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "NA" since the statement describes the results as "inconclusive" and does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. 

Please let me know if this is in line with your expectations or if I should proceed with the raw data provided. I will be happy to help with further cases.
