Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a prostate operation, which is most likely a Radical Prostatectomy (RP).
2. The statement mentions that "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed", and there is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, and the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer is "NA".
