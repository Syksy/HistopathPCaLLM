Based on the provided text, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the extracted values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to the allowed value "biopsy".
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text describes a "focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma", which indicates a malignant tumor finding. Although the text mentions that the finding is at the "suspicion-level", the presence of a suspected malignant tumor leads to a "yes" answer.
3. `gleason_grade`: The text does not provide a specific Gleason grade, and the finding is described as being at the "suspicion-level". Therefore, the answer is "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures. /John Doe, Meilahti, 11.11.2011
