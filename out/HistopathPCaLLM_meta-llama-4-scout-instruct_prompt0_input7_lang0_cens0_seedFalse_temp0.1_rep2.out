Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the extracted values:

1. `sample_type`: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies", so the original sample type is "biopsy".
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The statement describes a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, which indicates a malignant tumor finding. However, it's mentioned that the finding is at the suspicion level, but this doesn't change the fact that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. `gleason_grade`: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade, and the finding is mentioned to be at the suspicion level, so the value is "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes (feel free to provide more statements): 
"Cassettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures."
