Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as it mentions "prostate sample material" and "routinely collected according to provided instructions", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions that "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material" and that the rest of the material exhibited "structures one would typically expect", indicating that no cancerous tissue was found.
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) since the statement indicates that no malignant tumor findings were present.

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data will be provided later, I'm ready when you are!
