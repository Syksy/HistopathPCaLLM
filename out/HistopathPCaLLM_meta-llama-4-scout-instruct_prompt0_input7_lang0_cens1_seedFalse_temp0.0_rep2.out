Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor or a specific Gleason grade, most of the fields will be answered with "NA" or "no". Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* The sample type is assumed to be "biopsy" since the statement mentions that a prostate sample material was collected.
* There were no clear malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
* The Gleason grade is not mentioned, and the statement suggests that no definite conclusions could be drawn, so the answer is "NA".
