Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor or a specific Gleason grade, most of the fields will be answered with "NA" or "no". Here is the structured result in valid JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- The sample type is assumed to be "biopsy" since the statement mentions that a prostate sample was collected.
- There were no clear malignant tumor findings mentioned, hence "malignant_tumor" is answered as "no".
- No specific Gleason grade was reported, and given the inconclusive nature of the findings, "gleason_grade" is answered as "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for further processing if you have more statements.
