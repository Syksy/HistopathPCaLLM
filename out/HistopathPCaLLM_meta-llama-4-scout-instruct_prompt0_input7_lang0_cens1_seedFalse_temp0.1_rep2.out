Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data. Since the statement does not clearly indicate a malignant tumor or a specific Gleason grade, most of the fields will be answered with "NA" or "no". Here is the structured result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:
- The sample type seems to be a biopsy since it's mentioned that a "prostate sample material was routinely collected" and one sample "exhibited a point of interest". This fits best with a biopsy.
- There were no clear malignant tumor findings since it's stated that "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material" regarding the point of interest, suggesting uncertainty about malignancy.
- The Gleason grade is not mentioned, which is typically reported for malignant tumors, so it's "NA".
