Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties", indicating a malignant finding, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states the highest identified Gleason growth pattern as "4+3=7", which is the required format.

Note that I ignored the information about lymph nodes, macrophages, and PIN changes, as they are not directly relevant to the requested fields. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more text! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Samples 1 and 2 contain lymph nodes (3 pcs each), with lengths spanning 1 to 3 cm. Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate, which is run according to the routine protocol. In the third sample tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties and forming fusing and separately growing grandular structures. The findings cover approx 10% of the section area. Additionally, aggregates of macrophages are observed and high grade inflammatory changes. Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with the lower grade 3 consisting of approx 30%. High grade PIN-changes are also observed. The inspected lymph nodes are free from malignant findings (0/6).
