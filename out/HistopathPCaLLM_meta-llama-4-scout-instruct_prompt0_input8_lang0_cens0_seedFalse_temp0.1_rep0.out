Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP".
2. The text explicitly mentions "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties", indicating malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The highest identified Gleason growth pattern is reported as "4+3=7", which is the required format.

Note that I ignored the information about the lymph nodes, as the task focuses on the prostate cancer histopathological statement. Also, I didn't include any information about the PIN changes or inflammatory changes in the structured result, as they are not directly related to the requested fields.
