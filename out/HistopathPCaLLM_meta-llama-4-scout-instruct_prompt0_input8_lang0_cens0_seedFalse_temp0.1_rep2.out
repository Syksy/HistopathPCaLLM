Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties", indicating a malignant finding, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason grade**: The text explicitly states the highest identified Gleason growth pattern as "4+3=7", which is the required format.

Note that I ignored the information about lymph nodes, macrophages, and PIN changes, as they are not directly relevant to the requested fields. Also, I only considered the most severe lesion, which in this case is the tumor tissue with a Gleason grade of 4+3=7.
