Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text mentions "Suspicion of PIN-changes" and "Immunological activity is evident", which suggests that there are potentially malignant findings. Additionally, it is mentioned that samples 1 and 2 were "confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings", implying that sample 3 may contain malignant tissue.
3. **Gleason grade**: The text mentions that the "highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that there is an indication of a "recording mishap". As a result, no specific Gleason grade is reported, so I have assigned a value of "NA". 

Note that I've made assumptions based on the context and the information provided. If more information were available, these answers might change. 

Raw data used: 

 Samples with indices 1 and 2 contain non-primary tissue (multiple segments each), of varying quantities. Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol. Examination across the third sample reveals some potentially interesting properties, and the histological properties illustrate varying growth patterns. The most interesting parts covers approx 10% of the third sample. Immunological activity is evident and normal inflammation related changes are suspected. Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap. Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus regarding the various options. The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings.
