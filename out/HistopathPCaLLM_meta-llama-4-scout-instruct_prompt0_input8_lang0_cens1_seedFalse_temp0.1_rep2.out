Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured data:

```
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at these values:

1. `sample_type`: The text mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2" and "Sample 3", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. `malignant_tumor_findings`: The text mentions "Suspicion of PIN-changes" and "malignant findings", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings.
3. `gleason_grade`: The text mentions that the "highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that there is no grade score reported, which suggests that the Gleason grade is not available (NA). 

Note that I did not find a specific Gleason grade reported in the text, and the mention of "lower grade" covering above 10% of the sample is not sufficient to determine a specific grade. Therefore, I returned "NA" for the Gleason grade. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, here is the raw data that you provided:

"Samples with indices 1 and 2 contain non-primary tissue (multiple segments each), of varying quantities. Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol. Examination across the third sample reveals some potentially interesting properties, and the histological properties illustrate varying growth patterns. The most interesting parts covers approx 10% of the third sample. Immunological activity is evident and normal inflammation related changes are suspected. Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap. Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus regarding the various options. The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings."
