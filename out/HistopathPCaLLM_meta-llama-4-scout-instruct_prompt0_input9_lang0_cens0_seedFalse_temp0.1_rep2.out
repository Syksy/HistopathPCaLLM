Based on the provided text, I will extract the structured data and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this result:

1. **Sample type**: The text mentions "electrosection shavings" which is a common method for obtaining tissue samples during a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I inferred that the sample type is "TURP".
2. **Malignant tumor findings**: The text explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed", which directly answers this question as "no".
3. **Gleason grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I returned "NA" as the value.
