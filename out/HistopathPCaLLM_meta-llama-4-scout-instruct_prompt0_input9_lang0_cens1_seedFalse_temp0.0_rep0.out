Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears "rather normal" and that conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn due to suspected faulty processing of the sample material. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so the value is set to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value is set to "NA".
