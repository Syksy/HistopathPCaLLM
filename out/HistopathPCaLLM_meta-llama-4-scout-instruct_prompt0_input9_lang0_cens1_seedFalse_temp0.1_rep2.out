Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and return it in valid JSON format. Here is the structured result:

```
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, I set "sample_type" to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears "rather normal" and that "conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" due to suspected faulty processing of the sample material. This suggests that no malignant tumor findings were identified, so I set "malignant_tumor_findings" to "no".
3. Since no malignant tumor findings were identified, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I set "gleason_grade" to "NA". 

Please provide the raw data for the next statement. I'll be happy to help!
