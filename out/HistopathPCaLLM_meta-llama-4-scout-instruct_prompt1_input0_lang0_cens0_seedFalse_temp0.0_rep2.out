Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. The original sample type appears to be a "biopsy" since it mentions "Chipping samples" and "six blocks", which is consistent with a biopsy procedure.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma", which indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to make any adjustments! 

Also, note that I assumed "biopsy" as the sample type, although it's not explicitly mentioned. If you want me to be more conservative, I can change it to "NA" if there's any doubt. Let me know! 

Raw data used: 

"Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks. In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. The finding thus fits the suspected benign prostate hyperplasia."
