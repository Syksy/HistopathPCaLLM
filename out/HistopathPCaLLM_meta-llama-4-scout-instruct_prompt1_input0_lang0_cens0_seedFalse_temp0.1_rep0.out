Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this output:

1. The original sample type appears to be a "biopsy" since it mentions "Chipping samples" and "six blocks" which is a common method for processing biopsy samples.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma" which indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
