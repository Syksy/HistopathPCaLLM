Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples" which implies a biopsy, so I assigned "biopsy" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma", which indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I assigned "no" to this field.
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates that the finding is benign and there are no malignancies or carcinoma, I assigned "NA" to this field, as Gleason grading is typically applied to malignant tumors.
