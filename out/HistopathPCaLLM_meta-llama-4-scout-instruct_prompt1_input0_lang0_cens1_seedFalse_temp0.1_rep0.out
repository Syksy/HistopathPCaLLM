Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so it is classified as "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it is classified as "NA".
