Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate systematic biopsies", so the sample type is clearly "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion of the statement mentions that the diagnosis is "uncertain although leaning towards benign", and that the suspicious focus is "too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma". This implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain and leans towards benign, and there is no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
