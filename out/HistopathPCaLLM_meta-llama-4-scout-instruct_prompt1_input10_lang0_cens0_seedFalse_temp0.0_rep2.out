Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate systematic biopsies", which corresponds to a sample type of "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions a "suspicious focus" but concludes that the diagnosis is uncertain and "leaning towards benign", which implies that there are no definitive malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy field is set to "no".
3. Since the diagnosis is uncertain and leaning towards benign, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the Gleason field is set to "NA".
