Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate systematic biopsies", so the sample type is clearly "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: Although there is a "suspicious focus", the conclusion states that the diagnosis is uncertain and leans towards benign, but does not confirm malignancy. Therefore, I have classified it as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since the diagnosis is uncertain and leans towards benign, and there is no confirmed carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it is "NA".
