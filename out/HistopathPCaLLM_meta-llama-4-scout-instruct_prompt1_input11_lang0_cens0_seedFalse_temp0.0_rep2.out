Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a Gleason grading of "4+3", which is a direct and clear indication of the Gleason grade. Therefore, the value is "4+3". 

Note that I did not include any additional information, such as the size of the malignant focus or the presence of high-grade PIN, as these are not part of the requested structured fields. Also, I did not include any nested structures, as per the instructions.
