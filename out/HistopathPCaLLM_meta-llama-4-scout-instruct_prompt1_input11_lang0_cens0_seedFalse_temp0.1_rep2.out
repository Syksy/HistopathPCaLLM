Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a Gleason grading of "4+3", which is a direct report of the Gleason grade. Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it can be inferred that the sum is 7 (4+3=7). Therefore, the value is "4+3=7".
