Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the output:

1. "Sampletype" is set to "NA" because the text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP).
2. "Malignancy" is set to "no" because the text does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Although it mentions that fractions of the most usual Gleason scores could not be reliably assessed, it does not suggest the presence of cancer.
3. "Gleason" is set to "NA" because the text does not provide a conclusive Gleason grade. It mentions that Gleason scores 4 and 3 could not be reliably assessed, and the evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more data! 

Raw data used for this task: 

Prepared sampleset was run according to the standard protocol, with the weight(s) fitting within the scope of normal reference values. Microscopically prostate tissue is obsserved, which appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages. Fractions of the most usual Gleason scores in this type of a scenario, score 4 and score 3, could not be reliably assessed, as approximately only 5% of the whole material could be investigated. The requested evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. All parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section were inspected, and the cell architecture was confirmed to resemble prostate tissue.
