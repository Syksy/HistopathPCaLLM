Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is classified as "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement mentions that the cell architecture resembles prostate tissue, suggesting a benign or normal finding. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. The Gleason grade cannot be reliably assessed due to the limited amount of material that could be investigated (only 5% of the whole material). Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
