Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. The original sample type appears to be from electrosection shavings from the prostate, which is most likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample.
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the material is classified as benign, which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the material is classified as benign, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA".
