Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured answer:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "electrosection shavings from the prostate", which implies a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "TURP".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the material is "classified as benign", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is reported as "no".
3. Since the sample is classified as benign, there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
