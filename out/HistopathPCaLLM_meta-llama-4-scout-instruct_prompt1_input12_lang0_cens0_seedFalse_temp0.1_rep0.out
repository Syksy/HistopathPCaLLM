Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured answer:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "electrosection shavings from the prostate", which implies a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "TURP".
2. The statement mentions that the material is classified as "benign", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is classified as "no".
3. Since the material is classified as benign, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade is classified as "NA".
