Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have to assign "NA" as the value.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Hence, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. Therefore, I have to assign "NA" as the value.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
