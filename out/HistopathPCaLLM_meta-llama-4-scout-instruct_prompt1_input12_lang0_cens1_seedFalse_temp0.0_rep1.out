Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample consists of "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement, so I set it to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process.
