Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue, but it does not specify the original sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have to set it to "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the raw data for the next statement, I'm ready to process it!
