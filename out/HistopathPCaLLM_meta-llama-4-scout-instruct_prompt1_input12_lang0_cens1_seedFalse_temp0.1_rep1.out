Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have to set it to "NA" as it's not possible to determine the sample type with certainty.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that the sample consists of "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

The obtained sample consists of prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue.
