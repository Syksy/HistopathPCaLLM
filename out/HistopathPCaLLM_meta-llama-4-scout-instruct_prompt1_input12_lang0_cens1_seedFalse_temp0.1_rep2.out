Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions "prostate cancer tissue", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement, so it's classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing is appreciated.
