Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma is observed" in sample B, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the carcinoma has a Gleason score of 5 and a total Gleason stage of 9 (4+5), which indicates that the Gleason grade is 4+5=9. Since there are multiple lesions with different grades, I focused on the most severe one, which is 4+5=9.
