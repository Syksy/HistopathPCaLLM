Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "In sample B some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The statement also mentions that "Rest of the samples seem to exhibit rather ordinary patterns", which suggests that there are no clear indications of malignancy. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any specific grading of the tumor. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
