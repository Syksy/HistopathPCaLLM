Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is my interpretation:

* The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, but it appears to be a biopsy. However, since it's not explicitly stated, I will assign it as "NA".
* There are mentions of "irregularities" and "suspicious patterns", but no explicit confirmation of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will assign it as "NA" since it's not clear.
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any specific grading.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide more data to test and validate the algorithm. This will help in fine-tuning and ensuring that it works accurately for different types of statements. 

Raw data for testing would be appreciated. 

Let me know if I can help with anything else! 

(I will make sure to be more accurate with the sample type, as the example you provided was a prostate biopsy,  I will make sure my understanding for  and  in the algorithm gets updated accordingly)
