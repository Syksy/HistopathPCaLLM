Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "In sample B some irregularities are observed" and that "This suspicious pattern includes enough material for inspection and assessment", but it also states that "at this time further verification is needed via consultation". This suggests that there are some suspicious findings, but they are not conclusively malignant. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no", as there is no clear indication of malignancy.
3. There is no mention of Gleason grading in the statement, which suggests that the sample is likely benign or that the Gleason grade is not available. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
