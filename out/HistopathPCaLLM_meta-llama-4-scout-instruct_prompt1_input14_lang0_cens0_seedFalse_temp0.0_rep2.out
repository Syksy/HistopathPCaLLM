Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". This implies that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, assuming that the remaining 40% is score 4. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate, which is run on casettes according to normal routines. Samples D-G have apex, basis in samples K-P, seminal vehicles O-Q. Already in first section some tumorous growth is observed peripherally, with the tumor growth reaching near the capsule border. No breach is seen nor is there any pos. surgical margins. Basis and seminal vehicles are clean. The found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings.
