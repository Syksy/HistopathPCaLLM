Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy field is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason grade of 7, with a larger portion scoring 3 (approximately 60% of the findings). Although the statement doesn't explicitly provide the minor grade, it can be inferred that the minor grade is 4 (since 3+4=7). Therefore, the Gleason field is set to "3+4=7".
