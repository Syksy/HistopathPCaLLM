Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "tumors", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with a larger portion scoring 3 (approximately 60%). Assuming the remaining 40% scores 4, the Gleason grade can be inferred as 3+4=7. 

Let me know if this output meets your requirements!
