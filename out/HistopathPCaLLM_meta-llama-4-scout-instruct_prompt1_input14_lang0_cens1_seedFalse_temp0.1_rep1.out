Based on the provided text, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have to set it to "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits found", but it does not explicitly state that a malignant tumor was found. In fact, it suggests that further investigation is needed to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no", indicating that no malignant tumor findings were reported.
3. **Gleason**: The text mentions a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, but it does not report a Gleason grade for the current patient. Additionally, it states that further histopathological investigation is warranted before making any statements. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
