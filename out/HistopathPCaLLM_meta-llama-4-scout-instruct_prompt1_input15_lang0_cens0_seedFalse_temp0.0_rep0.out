Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which implies that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I classified it as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" being confirmed throughout the sample material, which indicates a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that Gleason 4 is the most represented grade, leading to a sum of 8. Since it doesn't provide a minor grade, I assumed the Gleason grade to be 4+4=8, which is a common way to represent a dominant Gleason grade with a minor component of the same grade.
