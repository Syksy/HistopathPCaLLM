Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I assigned the value "TURP" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and "malignant" findings, so I assigned the value "yes" to this field.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8". Since it doesn't provide a clear minor grade, I assumed the Gleason grade to be 4+4=8, which is a common representation of a Gleason score with a single dominant grade.
