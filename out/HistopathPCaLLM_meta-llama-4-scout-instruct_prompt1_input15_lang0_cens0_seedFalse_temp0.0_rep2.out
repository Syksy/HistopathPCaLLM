Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I classified it as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and "malignant" findings, so I classified it as "yes" for malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented" and "leading to a sum of 8". Since it doesn't provide a clear minor grade, I assumed the Gleason grade to be "4+4=8", which is a common representation of a Gleason score with a dominant grade of 4.
