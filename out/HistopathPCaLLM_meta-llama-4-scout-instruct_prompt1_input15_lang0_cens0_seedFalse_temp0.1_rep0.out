Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, since the statement mentions a Gleason sum of 8, but not in the format of "major+minor=sum", and assuming Gleason 4 is the most represented, I will try to provide a more accurate output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Please let me know if this is acceptable or if I should make any adjustments. 

Raw data used for this task: 

Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Patient has been considered suspect before due to elevation of PSA. Scopic inspection through the shavings does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material, with the Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. The finding therefore confirms the earlier suspicion.
