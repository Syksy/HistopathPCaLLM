Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I classified it as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" being confirmed throughout the sample material, which indicates a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that Gleason 4 is the most represented grade, leading to a sum of 8. Since it doesn't provide a minor grade, I assumed it's a homogeneous Gleason 4 score, and structured it as "4+4=8".
