Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it cannot be inferred with certainty, so I set it to "NA".
2. There is a mention of a suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma, but it is not based on any histopathology, and no conclusive malignant tumor findings are reported. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The statement mentions that a representative Gleason grade could not be determined, and the suspected Gleason sum is not based on any histopathology. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Note that the statement is more of a procedural update rather than a histopathological report, and it does not provide conclusive information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade.
