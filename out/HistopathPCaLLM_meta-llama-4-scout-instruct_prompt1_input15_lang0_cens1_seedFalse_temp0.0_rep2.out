Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it cannot be inferred with certainty. Therefore, the value is "NA".
2. There is a mention of a suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma, but it is not based on any histopathology, and no conclusive findings are reported. Therefore, the value is "NA".
3. The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this is not based on any histopathology and is only a speculation. Therefore, the value is "NA".

Note that the statement is more of a procedural note than a histopathological report, and it does not provide conclusive information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade.
