Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions a suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma, but it is not confirmed by histopathology. The malignancy finding is therefore uncertain and set to "NA".
3. The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this is not based on any histopathology and is therefore set to "NA". 

Note that the statement does not provide conclusive information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade, so the output reflects this uncertainty with "NA" values.
