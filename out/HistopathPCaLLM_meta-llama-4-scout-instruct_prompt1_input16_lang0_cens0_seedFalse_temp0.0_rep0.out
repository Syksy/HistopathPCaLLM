Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grading as "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4 -type of looping structures are observed... Conclusion that finding of score 7 comes from... architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part". This implies that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. 

Let me know if this output meets your requirements!
