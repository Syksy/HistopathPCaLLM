Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grading as "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4 -type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third of the carcinoma length" and concludes with a score of 7. This implies that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. 

Note that I have followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures, and only included the results from the most severe lesion.
