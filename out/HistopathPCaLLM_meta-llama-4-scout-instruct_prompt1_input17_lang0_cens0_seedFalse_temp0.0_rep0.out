Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3", which suggests that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7. 

Let me know if this is correct!
