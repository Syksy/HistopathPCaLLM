Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7. 

Note that I assumed the Gleason grade 4+3=7 based on the information provided, as it is a common way to express the Gleason score. If more specific information about the Gleason scoring system used in this context is available, the Gleason value might need to be adjusted accordingly.
