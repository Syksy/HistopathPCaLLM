Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text only refers to "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D", etc. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The text mentions that "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", which could suggest the presence of cancer, but it is not conclusive. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The text mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it does not provide a specific sum or a clear indication of a malignant tumor. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Note that the text appears to be a preliminary report that will be updated later, which may explain the lack of conclusive information.
