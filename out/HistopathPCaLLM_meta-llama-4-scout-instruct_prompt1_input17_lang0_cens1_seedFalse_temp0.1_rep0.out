Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will assign "NA" as the value.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the material "can be observed" and that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it also states that it will be assessed if the material is "fully healthy". The tone suggests that there is no clear indication of malignancy, and the focus is on assessment. Therefore, I will assign "no" as the value, indicating that there are no clear malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that Gleason differentiation stages between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it does not provide a specific Gleason grade or sum. Therefore, I will assign "NA" as the value.

Please let me know if this response aligns with your expectations or if I need to revise anything!
