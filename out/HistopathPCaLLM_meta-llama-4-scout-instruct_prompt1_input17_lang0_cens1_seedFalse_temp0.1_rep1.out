Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The text does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will assign "NA" as the value.
2. **Malignancy**: The text mentions that the material "can be observed" and that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it also states that it will be assessed if the material is "fully healthy". There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so I will assign "no" as the value.
3. **Gleason**: The text mentions that Gleason differentiation stages between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it does not provide a specific Gleason grade or sum. Therefore, I will assign "NA" as the value.

Please let me know if this response is accurate or if I need to revise it!
