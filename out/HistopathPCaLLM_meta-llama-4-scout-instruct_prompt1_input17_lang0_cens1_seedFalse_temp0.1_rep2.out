Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is my response:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text only refers to "prostate tissue sites" without specifying the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The text mentions that "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", but this is not conclusive evidence of malignancy. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it is not clear if this is related to a malignant tumor or not. Since there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a preliminary report that is not conclusive, and more assessment is needed. Therefore, most of the fields are set to "NA".
