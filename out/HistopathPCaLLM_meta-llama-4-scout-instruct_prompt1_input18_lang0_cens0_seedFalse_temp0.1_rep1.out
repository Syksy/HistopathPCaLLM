Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure", which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classified the malignancy as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7, as the larger fraction is grade 3 and the rest (40%) is likely grade 4. 

Please let me know if this output is correct or if I need to make any adjustments!
