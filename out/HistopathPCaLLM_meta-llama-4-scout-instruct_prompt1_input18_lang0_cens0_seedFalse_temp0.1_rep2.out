Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure", which is indicative of a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma" and "neoplastic", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason sum of 7, with a larger fraction having a stage of 3, representing about 60% of the tumor area. Although the exact distribution of the Gleason grades is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the Gleason grade is likely 4+3=7. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "4+3=7".
