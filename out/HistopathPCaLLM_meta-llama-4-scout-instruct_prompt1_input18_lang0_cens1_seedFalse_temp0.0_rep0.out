Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the output:

1. "Sampletype": The text does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it's classified as "NA".
2. "Malignancy": The text mentions that a small fraction (<5%) may be suspicious, but it's too small to assign a grade group, and >95% of the material appears benign. Therefore, there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, so it's classified as "no".
3. "Gleason": Since the suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade group, and there's no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more data! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches. In the sample material, a small fraction appears to stand out. The region of interest seems to form normal cell architecture, but a small fraction would require further inspection (less than 5%). The smaller portion that warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above, but the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group. On the other hand, >95% of material appears benign on preliminary inspection."
