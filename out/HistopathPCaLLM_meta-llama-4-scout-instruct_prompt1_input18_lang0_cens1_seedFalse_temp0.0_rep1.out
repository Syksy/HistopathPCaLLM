Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that a small fraction of the material "warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above", but it also states that ">95% of material appears benign on preliminary inspection". Since there is no definitive evidence of malignancy and the majority of the material appears benign, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the suspicious focus "might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above", but it's too small to properly assign a grade group. Therefore, the value is set to "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used for this example: 

"Sample material obtained through standard prostate related procedures are processed in 12 tissue batches. In the sample material, a small fraction appears to stand out. The region of interest seems to form normal cell architecture, but a small fraction would require further inspection (less than 5%). The smaller portion that warrants further investigation as it might contain a small subset of material ISUP GG 1 or above, but the suspicious focus right now is too small to properly assign a grade group. On the other hand, >95% of material appears benign on preliminary inspection."
