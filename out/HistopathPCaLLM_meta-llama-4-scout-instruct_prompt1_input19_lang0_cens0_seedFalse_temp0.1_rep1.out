Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", so the sample type is clearly "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement reports that "sample 4... appears to contain adenocarcinoma", which indicates a malignant tumor finding, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grades as "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%", which can be interpreted as a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Note that the exact percentages are not used to calculate the Gleason sum, but rather the reported grades are used directly. 

Let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further clarification!
