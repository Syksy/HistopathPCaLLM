Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", so the sample type is clearly "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement reports that "sample 4... appears to contain adenocarcinoma", which indicates a malignant tumor finding, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma: "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". Although the exact sum is not provided, it can be inferred that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, which is a common way to report the grade. 

Let me know if this meets your expectations!
