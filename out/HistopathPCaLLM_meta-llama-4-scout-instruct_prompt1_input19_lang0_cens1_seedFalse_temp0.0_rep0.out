Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions that the samples are prostate tissue, but it does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will assign "NA" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that sample 4 may contain cell architectures that differ from normal prostate tissue and suggests a possibility of malignancy, but it is uncertain and requires further verification. Since there is no definitive confirmation of malignancy, I will assign "NA" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: There is no mention of Gleason grading in the statement, so I will assign "NA" to this field.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to re-evaluate the statement!
