Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and it seems that the sample type is not clearly identified. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that sample 4's tissue "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and "possibly malignant", but it is not a definitive malignant finding. The statement also mentions that samples 2 and 3 represent "healthy benign prostate tissue". Since there is no clear malignant tumor finding, the value for "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is set to "NA". 

Note that the statement seems to be more of a laboratory processing and quality control note rather than a histopathological diagnosis report, which might explain the lack of specific information in the required fields.
