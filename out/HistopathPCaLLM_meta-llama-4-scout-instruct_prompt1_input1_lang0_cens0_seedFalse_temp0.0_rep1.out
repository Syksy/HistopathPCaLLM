Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy".
2. The statement concludes that "only benign-like growth is observed", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since the statement indicates that the growth is benign, there is no Gleason grade reported, so the answer is "NA".
