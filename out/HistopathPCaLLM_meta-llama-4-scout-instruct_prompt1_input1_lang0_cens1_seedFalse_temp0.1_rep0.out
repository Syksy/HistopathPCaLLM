Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" and that "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy", which implies that there are no conclusive malignant tumor findings, so it is classified as "NA".
3. The statement also mentions that additional inspection is required regarding "potentially clinically significant Gleason findings", which implies that there is no reported Gleason grade, so it is classified as "NA".

Let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. Total amount of sample material is sufficient. Mostly normal cell architectures are observed along with a focus on inspecting epithelial cell characteristics. However, the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings.
