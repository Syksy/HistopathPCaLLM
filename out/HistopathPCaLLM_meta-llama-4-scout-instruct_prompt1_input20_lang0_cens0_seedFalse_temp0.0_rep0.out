Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both the apex and basis, indicating malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned for both the apex and basis. The basis presents with a more severe lesion, which is classified as "4+4". According to the instructions, only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, so I used "4+4=8" as the Gleason grade.

Note that I chose the Gleason grade from the basis (4+4) as it seems to be the more severe lesion compared to the apex (3+4). If there's any ambiguity or if you'd like me to reconsider, please let me know!
