Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both the apex and basis, indicating malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned for both the apex and basis. The basis presents with a more severe Gleason grade of "4+4", which is used as the reported Gleason grade for the structured result. 

Note that I chose the more severe lesion (basis with Gleason 4+4) as per the instructions. If there were no malignant findings, the output would have "Malignancy" as "no" and "Gleason" as "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to make any adjustments! 

Raw data used:
The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection, which has been divided into six macrosections and the usual microscopic sections. Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma. Longitudinal section from the apex shows microscopically both fusing of the grandular structures, fitting best into the Gleason 3+4 staging, while the basis presents mostly with class 4+4. The size of these malignant focuses are approx. 8mm and 5mm, respectively. However, no breaching of the prostate capsule is observed, and the surgical margins are clear.
