Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection", which corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports two different Gleason grades: 3+4 for the apex and 4+4 for the basis. Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion, I extracted the higher grade, which is 4+4=8. 

Let me know if this is correct!
