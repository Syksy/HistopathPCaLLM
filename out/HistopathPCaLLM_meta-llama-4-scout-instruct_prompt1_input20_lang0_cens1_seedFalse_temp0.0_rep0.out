Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the patient has undergone various interventions in the pelvic region, and the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. However, it does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" due to the therapies given in the region, and even if a Gleason score could be found, it would not be prioritized. This implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I have classified it as "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that even in a hypothetical scenario, a lower-level Gleason score (such as 3+4) could be found, but it is not a definitive finding. Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
