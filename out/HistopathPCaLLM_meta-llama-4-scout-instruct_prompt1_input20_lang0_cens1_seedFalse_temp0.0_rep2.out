Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples were obtained, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). The samples were divided into six main sets, but the type of sampling procedure is not clear. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, and the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. This implies that no malignant tumor findings were possible to determine, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of 3+4, but this is not a confirmed finding. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
