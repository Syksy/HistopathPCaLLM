Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The obtained prostate tissue samples" were examined, which implies that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible" due to the therapies given in the region, and that the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. This implies that no malignant tumor findings were possible to detect, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. The statement mentions that even if a Gleason grade such as 3+4 were found, it would not be relevant due to the patient's overall disease burden. However, since no malignant tumor findings were possible to detect, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and "Gleason" is set to "NA".
