Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples were obtained, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). The samples were divided into six main sets, but the method of collection is not clear. Therefore, I have classified it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, and the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. This implies that no malignant tumor findings were possible to determine, so I have classified it as "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of 3+4, but this is not a confirmed finding. The statement concludes that the patient's overall disease burden is heavily influenced by other ongoing treatments, and re-sampling is recommended. Therefore, I have classified the Gleason grade as "NA".
