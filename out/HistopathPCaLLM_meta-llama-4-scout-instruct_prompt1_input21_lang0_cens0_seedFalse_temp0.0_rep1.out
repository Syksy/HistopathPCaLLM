Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "nucleoli are clearly visible", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classified the malignancy as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports the "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". Since the task is to report the results from the most severe lesion, I used the highest Gleason grade mentioned (5) and paired it with the second most common grade (4) in the format "major+minor=sum", resulting in "5+4=9".
