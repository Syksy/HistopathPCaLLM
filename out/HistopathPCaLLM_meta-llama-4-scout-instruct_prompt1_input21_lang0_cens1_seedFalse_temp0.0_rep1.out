Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the description "The extracted prostate material" is too vague to determine if it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or something else. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions that technical noise and dissolved nuclei make it difficult to assess cell differentiation patterns. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade, as the material is deemed too noisy for assessment and additional QC is recommended. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revisit the statement!
