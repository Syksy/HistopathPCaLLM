Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the description of the extracted prostate material is too vague to determine the sample type. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings. The mention of "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth" could be indicative of cancer, but the nuclei are dissolved, and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any information that would allow for its determination. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revisit the material (pun intended) after consulting QC.
