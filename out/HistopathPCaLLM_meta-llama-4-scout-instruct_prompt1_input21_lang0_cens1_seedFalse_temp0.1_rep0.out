Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as mentioned in the phrase "The extracted prostate material...". Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns, making it difficult to determine if there are malignant tumor findings. However, there is no clear indication of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade, and in fact, mentions that the material is too noisy to assess cell differentiation patterns. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
