Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as mentioned in the phrase "The extracted prostate material...of which about half been put to histology." and the context of prostate cancer histopathology.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and "the nuclei are dissolved", suggesting that the material is not suitable for a conclusive assessment. Therefore, I have chosen "no" for malignancy, indicating that no malignant findings were reported.
3. The reported Gleason grade is not mentioned, and the material is not suitable for assessment, so I have chosen "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
