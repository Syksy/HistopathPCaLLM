Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the description "extracted prostate material" is too vague to determine if it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or something else. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions "technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns" and that the material is too noisy to make a proper assessment. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade, as it mentions that the material is too noisy to assess cell differentiation patterns. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Note that the statement seems to be more of a laboratory report or a quality control note rather than a histopathological diagnosis, which might explain the lack of specific information about the sample type, malignancy, and Gleason grade.
