Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason score 3" and "Gleason score 4", which indicates that the reported Gleason grade is 3+4=7. I only considered the most severe lesion, which in this case is the left side fragments. 

Note that I ignored the information about the right side fragments, which did not exhibit signs of malignancies, as the task is to only report the results from the most severe lesion.
