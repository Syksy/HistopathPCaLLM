Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason score 3" and "Gleason score 4", which indicates that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. I assumed that the most severe lesion is reported, which in this case is the combination of scores 3 and 4. 

Note that I ignored the information about the right side fragments not exhibiting signs of malignancies, as the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion, which is on the left side. Also, I did not include any nested structures in the output JSON.
