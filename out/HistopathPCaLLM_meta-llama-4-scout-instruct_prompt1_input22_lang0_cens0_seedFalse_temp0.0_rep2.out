Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth" on the left side, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4 on the left side, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Since the right side does not exhibit signs of malignancies, we only consider the results from the left side, which is the most severe lesion. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is set to "3+4=7".
