Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Since the statement mentions that the left side fragments exhibit mainly low-grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures with Gleason scores 3 and 4, I assume that the most severe lesion has a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. 

Note that I ignored the information about the right side fragments, which do not exhibit signs of malignancies, as the task is to report on the most severe lesion.
