Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth" on the left side, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4 on the left side, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Since the right side does not exhibit signs of malignancies, we only consider the results from the left side, which is the most severe lesion.
