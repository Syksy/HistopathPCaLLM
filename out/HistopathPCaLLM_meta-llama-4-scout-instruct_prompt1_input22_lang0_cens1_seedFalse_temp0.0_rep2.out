Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the description of the sample material is unclear. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Sampletype" field.
2. The statement mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their highly fragmented and varying nature. This implies that no malignant tumor findings can be confirmed. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Malignancy" field.
3. The statement also mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures, and that proof-checking is needed to ensure the material's origin and conservation. As a result, no Gleason grade can be reported. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Gleason" field.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
