Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions that the material originates from the prostate, but it does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will assign "NA" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their highly fragmented and varying nature. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to this field.
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and that proof-checking is needed to ensure the material's origin and conservation. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to this field.

Note that the statement does not provide enough information to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade with certainty. Therefore, I have assigned "NA" to all fields.
