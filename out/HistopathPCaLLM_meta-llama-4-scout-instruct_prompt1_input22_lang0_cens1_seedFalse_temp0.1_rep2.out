Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sample type**: The statement mentions that the material originates from the prostate, but it does not specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their highly fragmented and varying nature. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. **Gleason grade**: The statement mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and that proof-checking is needed to ensure the material's origin and conservation. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Note that the statement does not provide enough information to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade with certainty. Therefore, I have set all fields to "NA" to reflect this uncertainty.
