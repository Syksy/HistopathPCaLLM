Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason score sum of 9, with a primary grade of 4 (60%), a secondary grade of 5 (30%), and a tertiary grade of 3. The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary and secondary grades, which in this case is 4+5=9. Therefore, the value is set to "4+5=9".
