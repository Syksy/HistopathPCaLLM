Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I derived the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason score sum of 9, with the primary grade being 4 (60% of the tumor) and the secondary grade being 5 (approximately 30% of the tumor). The tertiary grade is mentioned as 3, but it's noted as being "diminishingly small". According to the instructions, only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, which in this case is the combination of grades 4 and 5. Therefore, the value is set to "4+5=9".
