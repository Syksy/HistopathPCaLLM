Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "RP" (prostatectomy preparate).
2. There are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is based on the primary and secondary grades, which are 4 and 5, respectively, with a sum of 9. The tertiary grade is mentioned but not included in the Gleason score. 

Note that I used the most severe lesion information to answer the questions. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used: 
"Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed for further investigation (4 macro sections and the usual microscopic sections), which present an adenocarcinoma spanning from the mid section to the basis. Presents mainly differentation stage 4 (60%). The second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion) represents the poorly differentiated tumor component. Tertiary grade with the least area, class 3, is diminishingly small. The samples do not appear suggest capsule breach or positive margins. CONCLUSION: Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5."
