Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "RP" (prostatectomy preparate).
2. There are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is based on the primary and secondary grades, which are 4 and 5, respectively, with a sum of 9. The tertiary grade is mentioned but not included in the Gleason score. 

Note that I used the most severe lesion information provided, which is the primary and secondary grades 4 and 5. The Gleason score is reported as 4+5=9, which follows the preferred format.
