Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" is not conclusive, and the report is incomplete. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "potential Gleason 3 findings", but it is not a confirmed result. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".

Note that the statement appears to be a preliminary or incomplete report, and it does not provide sufficient information to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade with certainty.
