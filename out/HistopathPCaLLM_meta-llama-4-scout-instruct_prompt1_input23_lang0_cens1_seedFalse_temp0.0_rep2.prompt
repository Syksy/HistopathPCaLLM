Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." should be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation (multiple macro sections and microscopic runs). The selected subset of samples cover area spanning from the mid section to the basis. Based on the ultrasound report and palpation, however, the main region of interest would've been located in the apex - a prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings. CONCLUSION: The sample is to be reprocessed with a focus on the apex, in order to validate the initial suspicions.
