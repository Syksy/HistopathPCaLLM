Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the sample is being reprocessed. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Sampletype" field.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" is not conclusive, and the report is incomplete. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Malignancy" field.
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "potential Gleason 3 findings", but it is not a conclusive result. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to the "Gleason" field.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

Parts of a prepared sample set are taken for further investigation (multiple macro sections and microscopic runs). The selected subset of samples cover area spanning from the mid section to the basis. Based on the ultrasound report and palpation, however, the main region of interest would've been located in the apex - a prior incomplete report of sampled apex had reported potential Gleason 3 findings. CONCLUSION: The sample is to be reprocessed with a focus on the apex, in order to validate the initial suspicions.
