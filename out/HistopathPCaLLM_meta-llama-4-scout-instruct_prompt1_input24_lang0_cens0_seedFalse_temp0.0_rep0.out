Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
However, I noticed that a more specific Gleason grade is mentioned in the text: "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". To provide a more accurate answer, I will revise the JSON as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This revised answer provides a more specific Gleason grade that matches the sum mentioned in the text. Let me know if this is accurate or if I should revise it further!
