Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```
However, I noticed that a more specific Gleason grade is mentioned in the text: "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". A more accurate representation would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
Assuming that the Gleason grade is 4+4=8, as it is a common way to express the Gleason score. If you want to keep it as "NA" or change it, please let me know. 

Please provide the raw data for further processing. 

Also, note that I assumed the sample type is TURP, as it is explicitly mentioned in the text. The malignancy is marked as "yes" since the text mentions "malignant suspicion" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". 

Let me know if you need further clarification or changes! 

Raw data provided: 

"The sample consists of comfirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings, of which about half are run via 6 tissue casettes. In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth. Some degree of chronically inflammated tissue is also present. SUMMARY: Formerly benignly classified sample with a malignant suspicion had its chippings re-evaluated, now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma."
