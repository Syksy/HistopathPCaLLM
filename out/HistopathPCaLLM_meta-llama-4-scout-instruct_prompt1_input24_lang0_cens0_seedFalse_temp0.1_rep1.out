Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "turp-chippings", which indicates that the sample type is TURP.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "malignant suspicion" and "adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which indicates that the Gleason grade is 4+4=8. 

Note that I assumed the Gleason grade to be 4+4=8, as the statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a sum of 8, but does not explicitly state the minor grade. If more information were available, the Gleason grade could be further refined. However, based on the provided statement, the above structured data is the most accurate representation.
