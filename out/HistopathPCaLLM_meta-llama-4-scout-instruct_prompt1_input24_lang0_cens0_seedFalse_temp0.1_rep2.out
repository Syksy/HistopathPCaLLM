Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after re-reading the statement, I noticed that a Gleason sum is mentioned: "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Although it is not in the format "major+minor=sum", I can infer that the Gleason sum is 8. Since there is no information about the individual Gleason grades, I will assume that the sum is the only available information. 

Here is the revised JSON:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "8"
}
```
