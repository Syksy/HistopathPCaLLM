Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. However, I must note that the statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample, but rather a general description of a teaching material consisting of multiple patients' samples.

That being said, I will try to infer the information as follows:

* The sample types mentioned are "biopsies", "radical prostatectomies", and "shavings", but it is not clear which one is the most relevant. I will assume that "biopsy" is a reasonable answer, as it is a common sample type for prostate cancer diagnosis.
* The statement mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will answer "no" to the question of malignant tumor findings.
* The statement mentions Gleason grades, but only in the context of upgrading from benign material to low-grade scores. It does not provide a specific Gleason grade for a malignant tumor. Therefore, I will answer "NA" to the question of reported Gleason grade.

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
