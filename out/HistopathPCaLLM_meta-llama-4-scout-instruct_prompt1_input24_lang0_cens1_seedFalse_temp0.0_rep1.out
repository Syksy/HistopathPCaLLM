Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. However, I must note that the statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample, but rather a summary of a teaching material consisting of multiple patients' samples.

Given the lack of specific information about a single patient's sample, I will return "NA" for the sample type and assume that the statement is generally describing a collection of benign cases with some upgrading to low-grade Gleason scores.

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know if this is acceptable or if I should attempt to infer more specific information from the statement. Additionally, if you provide more context or clarify what specific information you are looking for, I'll be happy to try and assist you further. 

Raw data provided seems to be more of a description of the dataset rather than a specific patient's medical history, if more specific text is provided I will be happy to help.
