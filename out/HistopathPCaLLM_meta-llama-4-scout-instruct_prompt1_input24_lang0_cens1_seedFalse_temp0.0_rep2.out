Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not specifically mention a single sample type, but rather mentions multiple sets of patients with various types of samples (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings). Since it's not clear which specific sample type is being referred to, I will classify it as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will classify it as "no" for malignancy.
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades, but only in the context of upgrading benign material to low-grade scores (e.g., Gleason 3+3 or 3+4). Since there is no mention of a specific Gleason grade for a malignant tumor, I will classify it as "NA".
