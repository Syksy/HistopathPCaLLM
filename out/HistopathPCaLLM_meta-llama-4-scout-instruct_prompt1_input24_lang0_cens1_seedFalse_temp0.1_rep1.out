Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. However, I must note that the statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample, but rather a summary of a teaching material consisting of multiple patients' samples.

That being said, I will try to infer the information from the statement. Since there is no specific mention of a malignant tumor or a Gleason grade for a particular patient, I will assume that the statement is generally describing benign cases with some upgrading to low-grade Gleason scores.

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

* "Sampletype" is set to "NA" because the statement mentions multiple sample types (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, shavings) but does not provide a specific sample type for a particular patient.
* "Malignancy" is set to "no" because the statement implies that the cases are benign, with some upgrading to low-grade Gleason scores, but no mention of malignant tumors.
* "Gleason" is set to "NA" because the statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade for a particular patient, but rather mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4.
