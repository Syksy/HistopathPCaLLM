Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. However, I must note that the statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample, but rather a summary of a teaching material consisting of multiple patients' samples.

Given the lack of specific information about a single patient's sample, I will assume that the statement is not describing a specific patient's results, but rather providing context about a collection of samples.

Here is my attempt to structure the data:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The original sample type is not specified for a particular patient, so I will use "NA".
2. There is no mention of a specific patient's malignant tumor findings, so I will use "NA".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as being upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6 (3+3) in some cases, but not for a specific patient, so I will use "NA".

Please let me know if this is the expected output or if I should attempt to extract more information from the statement. 

Raw data used: 

The samples consisted of multiple sets of patients, from whom biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings had been available post-benign diagnosis. The examined material was intended to illustrate inter-observed variation and to train the interns in low grade scoring settings; in around 1/4 of the cases, the benign material was upgraded to either Gleason 3+3 or at most 3+4 thanks to advancements in imaging. The re-evaluation of the cases showed no upgrading to GG 3 or above. SUMMARY: Teaching material of multiple patients were inspected by interns and then verified by senior histopathologists, resulting in few cases that upgraded to e.g. Gleason 6. Due to the long time since the sample material was gathered (>15y), the exercise was not intended for actual clinical guidance.
