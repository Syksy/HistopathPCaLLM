Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "tissue cylinders" and multiple "samples", which suggests that the original sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "presence of prostate adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Although the statement provides detailed information about the Gleason patterns and percentages, it does not provide a direct sum. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the dominant patterns are Gleason 4 and 3. Since the statement concludes with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, I will assume that the Gleason grade is a combination of these two patterns. Given that a common way to report Gleason grades is in the format "major+minor=sum", I will use the most severe patterns mentioned (4 and 3) to construct the Gleason grade as "4+3=7".

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further clarification! 

Raw data used for this example: 

 Sample (1) contains two tissue cylinders, with the length 8+6mm. In the longer one, approximately 4mm in length (about half of total length) contains tumor growth, with Gleason 4 -pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%. Sample (2) single 10mm, with tumor tissue approx 5mm in length and differentation stage Gleason 4 approx 15% and 3 stage less than 35%. Sample (3) contains 5+5mm, in which no abnormal prostate tissue is observed. Samples (1) and (2) also contain PIN-changes. Thus, conclusion based on above samples is presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.
