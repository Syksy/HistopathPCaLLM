Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "Sample (1)", "Sample (2)", and "Sample (3)", which suggests that the original sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. The statement concludes that "presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliable verified", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, or at least, they cannot be confirmed. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since the statement does not provide any information about a specific Gleason grade, and the conclusion is that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be verified, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
