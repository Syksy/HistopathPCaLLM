Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of a "widely spread tumor", which implies malignant findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent". This suggests that the Gleason grade is a combination of 3 and 4, which can be represented as "3+4=7". 

Note that I've followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures, and only reported the results from the most severe lesion.
