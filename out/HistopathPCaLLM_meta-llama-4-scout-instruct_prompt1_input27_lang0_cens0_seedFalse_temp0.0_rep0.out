Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "shavings" and "casettes", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I inferred the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Carcinoma was histologically detected", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason grade of "3+3=6", which is a clear and specific value. I extracted this value as is, without any modifications.
