Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is my interpretation:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, but it appears to be a tissue sample from the prostate. Given the context, I will assume it is not a biopsy, RP, or TURP, so I will use "NA".
* There is a mention of abnormal growth patterns, but it is debatable if it can be considered a malignant tumor finding. However, the statement does not clearly indicate a benign finding, so I will use "yes" for malignant tumor findings, but with caution.
* The Gleason score is mentioned as "3" in small quantities, but it is debatable. I will use "3+NA=NA" or simply "NA" since it's not clear.

However, I will provide a more straightforward answer based on the provided guidelines:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise it. 

Raw data provided seems to be just one statement in this case. If you provide more statements I can try and help with those as well. 

Also, note that for some statements it might be hard to give an accurate answer (like in cases of unclear or ambiguous text), in real-world scenarios those cases would likely be reviewed and verified by a medical professional. 

If I had to guess Sampletype I would pick "NA" here as that seems like safest assumption given text but ideally Sampletype should be explicitly stated. 

In case I need to make further changes based on feedback feel free to let me know. 

If there are further statements you would like me to process I can certainly help.
