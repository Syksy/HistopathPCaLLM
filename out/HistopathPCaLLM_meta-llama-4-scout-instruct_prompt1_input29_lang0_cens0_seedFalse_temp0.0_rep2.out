Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes the sampling process, which suggests that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is inferred as "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" and describes the tumor characteristics, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 3" and provides a "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." This information allows us to infer that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7. 

Let me know if this output meets your requirements or if you need further clarification!
