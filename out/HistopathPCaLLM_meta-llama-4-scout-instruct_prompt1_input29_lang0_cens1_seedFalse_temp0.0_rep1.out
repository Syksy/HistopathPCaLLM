Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a prostate tissue material, which is most likely a "RP" (radical prostatectomy) sample, given that it's a fresh tissue material and multiple samples were taken from different parts of the prostate.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions that certain assessments (e.g., capsule penetration, perineural invasion) cannot be made, and the samples A and C, which were of particular interest, were found to be non-prostatic tissue. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason grade cannot be determined from the statement, as it explicitly mentions that the "Score sum determination was not possible" and that samples A and C need to be re-examined. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
