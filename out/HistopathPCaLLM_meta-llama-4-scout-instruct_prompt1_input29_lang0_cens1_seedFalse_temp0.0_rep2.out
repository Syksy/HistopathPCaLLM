Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a prostate tissue material, which is most likely from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) procedure, given that it's described as "Fresh prostate tissue material" and multiple samples were taken from different parts of the prostate. Therefore, I chose "RP" as the sample type.
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The text mentions that "Capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed", which implies that the samples may have contained tumor cells, but it's not explicitly stated. Additionally, the statement mentions that the samples A and C were non-prostatic tissue, which further adds to the uncertainty. Therefore, I chose "NA" for malignancy.
3. The statement explicitly mentions that "Score sum determination was not possible" and that samples A and C need to be re-examined. This implies that a Gleason grade could not be determined from the provided samples. Therefore, I chose "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this interpretation is correct or if I need to revise it!
