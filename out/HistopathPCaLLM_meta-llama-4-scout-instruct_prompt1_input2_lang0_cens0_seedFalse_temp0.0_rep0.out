Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen". Prostatectomy specimen is commonly referred to as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) in medical terminology, so I mapped it to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic description mentions "normal benign growth", "atrophy", "spot-like inflammation", and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia", but no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA". 

Let me know if this is correct! 

Raw data used: 

The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen, with a total weight 44g. Outer dimensions are approx 5*4*3 cm without the vehicles. Three macrosections and standard routine microsections are ordered. The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use. Black marker colour is applied dorsally, right section in yellow, and left section in green. Microscopically all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth. Some atrophy and spot-like inflammation is found, along with growth suggestive of hyperplasia. The resection are surfaces are confirmed to be clean, the capsule is showing no abnormal growth, and seminal vehicles appear to contain no tumor growth. SUMMARY: Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging.
