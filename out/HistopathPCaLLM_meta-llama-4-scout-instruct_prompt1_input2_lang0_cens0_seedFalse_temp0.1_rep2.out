Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen". Prostatectomy specimen is commonly referred to as RP (Radical Prostatectomy) in medical terminology, so I mapped it to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic description mentions "normal benign growth", "atrophy", "spot-like inflammation", and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia", but no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set it to "NA".
