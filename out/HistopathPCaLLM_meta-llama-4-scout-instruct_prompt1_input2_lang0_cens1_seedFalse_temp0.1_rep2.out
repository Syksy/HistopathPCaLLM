Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and it seems to be an autopsy specimen. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample exhibits "inflammatory and age-related changes" and that "Further inspection and sample re-runs are required" to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. This implies that no malignant tumor findings were observed or confirmed, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
