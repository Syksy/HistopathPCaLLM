Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The text mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells", which suggests that the sample type is likely TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
2. **Malignancy**: The text explicitly mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The text mentions "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5" and also mentions that the Gleason grade was updated from "3+3" to a higher grade. Based on this information, I inferred that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
