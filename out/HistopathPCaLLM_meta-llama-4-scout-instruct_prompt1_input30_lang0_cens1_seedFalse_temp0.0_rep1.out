Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not mentioned in the statement, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the earlier uncertain diagnosis could not be confirmed or denied, and that the suspicions of atypical findings could not be confirmed. This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement, so I set it to "NA". 

Let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Originally, atypical findings were suspected in the cells, but JD & JD could not confirm or deny the suspicions. The earlier uncertain diagnosis of the patient could therefore not be determined, defining their status requires further examination. The patient must be contacted.
