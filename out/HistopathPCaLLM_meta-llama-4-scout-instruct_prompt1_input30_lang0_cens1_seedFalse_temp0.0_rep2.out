Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not mentioned in the statement, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the earlier uncertain diagnosis could not be confirmed or denied, and that the suspicions of atypical findings could not be confirmed. This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement, so I set it to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process.
