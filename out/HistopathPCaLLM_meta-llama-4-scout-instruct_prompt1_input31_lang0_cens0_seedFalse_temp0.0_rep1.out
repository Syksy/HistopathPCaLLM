Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The text mentions that the patient had undergone "routine systematic biopsy" and later "two targeted biopsies". Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The text describes findings of cancerous lesions, including a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" and a "second most common differentiation pattern is 5". This indicates that there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The text reports a Gleason grade of "4+5" (primary and second most common differentiation patterns, respectively). Although a previous Gleason sum of 6 was mentioned, the text indicates that the novel findings confirm that this did not capture the most aggressive tumor characteristics. Therefore, the reported Gleason grade for the most severe lesion is "4+5=9".
