Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" and "Interpretation of tissue proved difficult", which suggests that a biopsy was performed. Therefore, I assume the sample type is "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "suspicious findings", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumors. In fact, it mentions that "it is unclear if these could have had effect on the suspicious findings" and that "additional samples and treatment planning needed", which suggests that the findings may not be conclusive. Therefore, I classify the malignancy as "no" (no clear evidence of malignant tumor findings).
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any specific tumor characteristics, so I set the Gleason field to "NA".
