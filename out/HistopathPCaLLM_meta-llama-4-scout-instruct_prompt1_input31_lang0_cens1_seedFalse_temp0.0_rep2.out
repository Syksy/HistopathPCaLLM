Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "necessary samples were taken" and "Interpretation of tissue proved difficult", which suggests that a biopsy was performed. Therefore, I assume the sample type is "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions "suspicious findings", but it is unclear if these findings are malignant. However, it is mentioned that the suspicious findings "encompass only 5 % of the original samples" and that "it is unclear if these could have had effect on the suspicious findings". This suggests that the findings may not be conclusive, and therefore I will classify the malignancy as "no" (no clear evidence of malignancy).
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any specific tumor characteristics, so I will set the Gleason field to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used for this task: 

 Patient undergone routine check due to suspicious symptoms. Symptoms had increased, so after imaging necessary samples were taken. A clear technical failure in the first sample. Other samples contain suspicious findings, but they encompass only 5 % ot the original samples. Patient has other treatments regarding unrelated diagnosis, it is unclear if these could have had effect on the suspicious findings. Interpretation of tissue proved difficult, additional samples and treatment planning needed.
