Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the patient "originally underwent a radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement concludes that the findings from the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are benign, it also mentions that the patient had an "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate", indicating that there were malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports various Gleason patterns, including 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion, I extracted the highest Gleason grade, which is 4+4=8. 

Let me know if this is correct!
