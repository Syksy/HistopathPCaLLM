Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the patient "originally underwent a radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement concludes that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear of cancer, it initially mentions that the patient had a "multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports various Gleason patterns, including 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, and 4+3. Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion, I extracted the highest Gleason grade, which is 4+4=8. 

Let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further clarification!
