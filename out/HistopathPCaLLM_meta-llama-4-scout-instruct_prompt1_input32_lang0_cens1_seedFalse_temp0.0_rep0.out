Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the statement seems to be a summary of various samples. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, which suggests that there were no malignant findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process. 

Raw data seems to be missing, if you provide it I will be happy to help.
