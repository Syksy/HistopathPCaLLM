Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it's classified as "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, and the statement explicitly mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, indicating no malignancy. Therefore, it's classified as "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade, so it's classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 

"UPDATE: The patient's samples are in different batches. The median length was 3cm and longest was 5cm. The samples are from different locations. The examination results are different from one sample to other. The findings from the macroscopic sections of the original primary prostate tissue remain.  In summary, the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear."
