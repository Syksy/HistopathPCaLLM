Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it seems that the statement is discussing the results of multiple samples. Therefore, the sample type is marked as "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, which suggests that there are no malignant findings. Therefore, the malignancy is marked as "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
