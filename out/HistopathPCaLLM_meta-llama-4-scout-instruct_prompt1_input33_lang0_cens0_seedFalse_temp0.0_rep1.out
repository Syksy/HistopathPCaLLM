Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate", which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and "malignant findings", which clearly indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3", which indicates that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7 (or 4+3=7, but we only need to report one, and 3+4 is the more common way to express this). 

Note that I ignored the additional details mentioned in the statement, such as the tumor penetration, lymph node involvement, and seminal vehicle status, as they are not relevant to the three structured fields requested.
