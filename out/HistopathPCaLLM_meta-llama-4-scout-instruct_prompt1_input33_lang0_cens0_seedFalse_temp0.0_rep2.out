Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate", which indicates that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and "malignant findings", which clearly indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3", which suggests that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7 (or 4+3=7, but we only need to report one). Since the statement mentions that the growth pattern varies by these Gleason types, I chose the first one, 3+4=7. 

Let me know if this is correct!
