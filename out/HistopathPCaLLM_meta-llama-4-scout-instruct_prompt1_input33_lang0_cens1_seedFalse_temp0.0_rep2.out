Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes", but it does not indicate the presence of a malignant tumor in the prostate sample. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, so I set it to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process. 

Raw data seems to be missing, if you provide it I will be happy to help.
