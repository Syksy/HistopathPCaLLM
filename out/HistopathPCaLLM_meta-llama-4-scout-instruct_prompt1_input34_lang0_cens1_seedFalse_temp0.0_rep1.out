Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the findings do not indicate prostatic malignancy and instead suggest hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. Therefore, the malignant tumor finding is "no".
3. Since the statement indicates a benign condition (hyperplastic prostate tissue), there is no reported Gleason grade, so it is classified as "NA".
