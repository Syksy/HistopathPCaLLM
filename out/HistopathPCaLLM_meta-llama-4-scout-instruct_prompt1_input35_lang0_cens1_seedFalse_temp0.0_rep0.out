Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. 

The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will assign it as "NA". 

There are no explicit malignant tumor findings mentioned (like adenocarcinoma), but there is a mention of "high-grade PIN-changes" which is a precursor to cancer but not a malignant finding itself. However, given the context and common medical understanding, the presence of high-grade PIN changes indicates a risk or a precursor condition but does not directly classify as a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, I will consider it as "no" for malignant tumor findings for the purpose of this exercise.

The Gleason grade is not mentioned, so for a statement that does not confirm malignancy, it should be "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
