Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. 

The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will assign it as "NA". 

There are no explicit malignant tumor findings mentioned, but high-grade PIN changes are mentioned which often precede malignancy but are not cancer themselves. However, given that there's no clear indication of invasive cancer, I will consider this as "no" malignant findings for the purpose of this task.

The Gleason grade is not mentioned, so for a statement that does not confirm malignancy, I will assign it as "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
