Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I have marked it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I have marked it as "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, I have marked it as "NA".
