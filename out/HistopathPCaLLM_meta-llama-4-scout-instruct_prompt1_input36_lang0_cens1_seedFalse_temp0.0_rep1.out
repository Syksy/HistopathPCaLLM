Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "epithelial hyperplasia", which is a benign condition, and there is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
