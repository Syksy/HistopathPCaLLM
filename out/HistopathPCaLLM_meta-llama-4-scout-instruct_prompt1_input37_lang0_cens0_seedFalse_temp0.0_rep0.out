Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by "electrosection chippings" and the mention of a preparate, which is consistent with the TURP procedure.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings mentioned; the statement indicates "Findings indicate hyperplasia," which suggests a benign condition.
3. The Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) for benign statements. 

Let me know if you have further questions or if you'd like me to process additional statements!
