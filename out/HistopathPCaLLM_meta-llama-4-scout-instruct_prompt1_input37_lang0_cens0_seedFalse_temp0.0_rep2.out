Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by "electrosection chippings" and "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components", which is consistent with TURP samples.
2. There are no indications of malignant tumor findings; the statement mentions "Findings indicate hyperplasia", which is a benign condition.
3. Since the statement indicates a benign condition (hyperplasia) and does not mention any malignant tumor or Gleason grading, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
