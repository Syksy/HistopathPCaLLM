Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA" as it's not possible to determine the sample type with certainty.
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, and the histological examination only reveals "prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents" and "minor inflammation", which suggests a benign condition. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant prostate cancer cases. As this case appears to be benign, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
