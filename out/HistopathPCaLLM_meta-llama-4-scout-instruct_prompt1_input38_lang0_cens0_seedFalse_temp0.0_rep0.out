Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "needle biopsies", which corresponds to a "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No suspected malignity", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA".
