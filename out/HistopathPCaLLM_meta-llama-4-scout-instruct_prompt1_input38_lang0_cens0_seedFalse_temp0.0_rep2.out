Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I derived the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "needle biopsies as samples", so the original sample type is "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No suspected malignity", which implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there were no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
