Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is classified as "NA".
2. There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, and the statement only mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation", which suggests a benign condition. Therefore, the answer is "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Therefore, the answer is "NA" for Gleason grade.
