Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "a tumor" and "malignant" is implied, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports Gleason 3 (major) and 4 (minor) differentiation stages, resulting in a Gleason grade of 7. I formatted this as "3+4=7" to match the required format.
