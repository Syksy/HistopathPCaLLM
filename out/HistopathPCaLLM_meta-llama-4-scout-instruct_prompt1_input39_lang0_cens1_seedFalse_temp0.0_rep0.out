Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings, which implies that there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The Gleason score cannot be assessed, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

 Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations. But it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings. Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point.
