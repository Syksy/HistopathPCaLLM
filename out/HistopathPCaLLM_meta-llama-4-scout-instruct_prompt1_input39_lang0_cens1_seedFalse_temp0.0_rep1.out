Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it is not clear whether there are benign hyperplasia or malignant findings, which implies that the presence of malignancy is uncertain. Therefore, I will also default to "NA" for this field.
3. The Gleason score cannot be assessed, which means it is not available. Therefore, I will also use "NA" for this field.

Let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

 Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations. But it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings. Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point.
