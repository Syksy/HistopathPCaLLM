Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" since the statement mentions "prostate chippings", which is a common sample type for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedures.
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "Nothing indicating malignancy is found", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
