Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classified the malignancy as "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no indications of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I classified it as "NA".
