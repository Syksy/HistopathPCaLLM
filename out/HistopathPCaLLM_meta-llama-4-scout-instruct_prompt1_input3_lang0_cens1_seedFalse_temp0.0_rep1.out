Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and it seems to be a general prostate material sample, so I classified it as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run", implying that no malignant tumor findings were made, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so I set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process. 

 Raw data for next task is awaited...
