Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and it appears to be a general prostate material sample, so I will classify it as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run", implying that no malignant tumor findings were made, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run. In histological inspection, some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run.
