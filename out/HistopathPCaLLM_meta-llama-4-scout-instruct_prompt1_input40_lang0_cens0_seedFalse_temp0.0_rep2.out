Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by the mention of "shaving material" and "casettes", which is consistent with TURP procedures.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as stated explicitly: "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth."
3. The reported Gleason grade is not applicable (NA) for benign statements. 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data used: 

The shaving material weighs approx 8.9g, approx 5g set on eight casettes. Histological examination reveals hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. No atypical or invasive epithelial growth. SUMMARY: Benign prostate hyperplasia
