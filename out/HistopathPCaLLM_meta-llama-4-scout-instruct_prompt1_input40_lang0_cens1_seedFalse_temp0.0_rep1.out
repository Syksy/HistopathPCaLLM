Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA" as it's not possible to determine the sample type with certainty.
2. The statement mentions "at least hyperplastic prostate" and "inflammation, but possibly something else", but there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process. 

Raw data seems to be missing, if you provide it I will be happy to help.
