Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "at least hyperplastic prostate" and "inflammation", but does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

"Examined material weights 8.9, approx 8 casettes are used. Histological examination reveals at least hyperplastic prostate and ...... At least inflammation, but possibly something else. Further examination is needed."
