Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "systematic biopsies", which implies that the sample type is "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material", which indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA".
