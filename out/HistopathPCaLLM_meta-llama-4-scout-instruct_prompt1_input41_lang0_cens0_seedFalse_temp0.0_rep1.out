Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is "biopsy" since the statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there were no signs of prostate cancer, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
