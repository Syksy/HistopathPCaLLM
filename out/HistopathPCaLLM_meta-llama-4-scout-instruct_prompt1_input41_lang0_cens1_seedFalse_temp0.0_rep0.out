Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required fields. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA" as it's not possible to determine the sample type with certainty.
2. The statement mentions that it's "hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were confirmed. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
