Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required fields. Here is the result in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it is "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were confirmed, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it is classified as "NA".
