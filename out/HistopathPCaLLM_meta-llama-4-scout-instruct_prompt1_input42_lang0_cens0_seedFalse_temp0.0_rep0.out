Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and a "score 7 (4+3)", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7", which is in the required format. 

Let me know if you need further clarification!
