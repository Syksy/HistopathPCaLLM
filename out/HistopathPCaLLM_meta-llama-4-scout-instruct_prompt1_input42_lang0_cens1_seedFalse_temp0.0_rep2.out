Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is my interpretation:

* The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied to be a prostate sample, and the weight is given, which is consistent with a biopsy or RP sample. However, without explicit mention of "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", I will default to "NA".
* The statement mentions "Mixed findings" and uncertainty about whether it is cancer or inflammation, which implies that there might be some suspicious features, but a definitive diagnosis of malignancy cannot be made. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" for malignancy.
* There is no mention of Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Therefore, I will default to "NA" for Gleason grade.

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
