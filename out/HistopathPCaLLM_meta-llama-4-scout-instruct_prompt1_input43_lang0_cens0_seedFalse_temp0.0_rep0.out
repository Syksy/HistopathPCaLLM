Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and "Material run in cassettes A-H", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material". This indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no signs of malignancy, a Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
