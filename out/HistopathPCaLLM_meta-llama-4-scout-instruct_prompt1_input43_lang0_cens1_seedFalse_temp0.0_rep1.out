Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate samples" but does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I classify it as "NA" due to lack of information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached," which implies that there are no clear malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classify it as "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since the statement suggests that there are no clear malignant tumor findings and does not provide any information about Gleason grades, I classify it as "NA".
