Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached", implying that there are no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
