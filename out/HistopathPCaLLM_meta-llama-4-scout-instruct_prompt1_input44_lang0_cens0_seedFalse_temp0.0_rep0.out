Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to a value of "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "now no tumor tissue can be seen", indicating that there are no malignant tumor findings, which corresponds to a value of "no" for malignancy.
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, which corresponds to a value of "NA".
