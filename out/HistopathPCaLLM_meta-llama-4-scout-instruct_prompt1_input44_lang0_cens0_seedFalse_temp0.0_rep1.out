Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured answer:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "but now no tumor tissue can be seen", indicating that there are no malignant tumor findings, which corresponds to "no" for malignancy.
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, which corresponds to "NA".
