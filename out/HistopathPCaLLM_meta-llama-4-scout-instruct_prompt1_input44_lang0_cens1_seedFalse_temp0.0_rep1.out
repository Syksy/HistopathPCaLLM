Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the extracted values:

1. "Sampletype": The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it's classified as "NA".
2. "Malignancy": The statement explicitly mentions that "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings in this specific sample. Therefore, it's classified as "no".
3. "Gleason": Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing purposes: 
"Representative prostate samples according to standard routine. Normally structured prostate tissue with varying gland size seen under microscope. Little chronic inflamation and in some places atrophy. Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes. Note: Earlier biopsies reported prostate cancer."
