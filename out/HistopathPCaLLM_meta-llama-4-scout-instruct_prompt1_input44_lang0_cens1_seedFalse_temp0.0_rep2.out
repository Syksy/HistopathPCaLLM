Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Since it mentions "prostate samples" and "earlier biopsies", it is likely that this is not a biopsy sample being described, but rather a tissue sample from a different source ( possibly from a more radical procedure like RP). However, given the description, I couldn't confidently determine the sample type. Therefore, I chose "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes", which implies that there are no clear signs of malignancy in this particular sample. Therefore, I chose "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grades or scores, which is consistent with a benign finding. Therefore, I chose "NA".
