Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "whole prostatectomy preparate as sample", which indicates that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "fusing tumor tissue focus" and mentions "perineural invasion" and "tissue gleason 3", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "classes 3+4" which corresponds to the Gleason grading system. Although the statement also mentions "tissue gleason 3", it seems that the most severe lesion is described by the combination of grades 3 and 4. Therefore, the value is "3+4=7".
