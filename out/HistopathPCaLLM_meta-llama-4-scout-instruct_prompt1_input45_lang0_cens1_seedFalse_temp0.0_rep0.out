Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and "No metastases seen in lymph nodes in the area", which suggests that there are no clear malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the next statement to process. 

Raw data for next statement is not provided, I assume it will be given when it is time for next statement.
