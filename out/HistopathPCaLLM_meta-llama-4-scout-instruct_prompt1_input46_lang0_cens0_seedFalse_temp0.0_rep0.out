Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by the mention of "Shaved prostate chippings" and "Material was set on eight cassettes".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as stated explicitly: "No signs of prostate cancer in the material."
3. Since there were no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I assigned "NA" (Not Available) to this field.
