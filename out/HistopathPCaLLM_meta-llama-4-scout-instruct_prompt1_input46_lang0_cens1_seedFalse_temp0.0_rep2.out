Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that it is not possible to assess whether there are cancer-related changes or not, but it does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "no" for malignancy.
3. Since there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not reported, and the answer is "NA".
