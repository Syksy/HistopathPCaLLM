Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatic material" and "biopsy" is a reasonable inference, although not explicitly stated. Given the context, I assume it's a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings" which implies that no malignant tumor findings were identified or confirmed. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and I set it to "NA".
