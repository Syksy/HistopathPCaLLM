Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate resection", which corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and "tumor", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports two tumor foci with different Gleason grades. The first focus has Gleason grades 4 and 3, while the second focus has Gleason 5 (>80%) and a small portion of Gleason 4. The summary states a Gleason 9 tumor, which is consistent with the grades reported. I extracted the most severe lesion's Gleason grade as "4+5=9".
