Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and it seems to be a sample obtained from autopsies. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" (not applicable).
2. The statement mentions that there are some histological changes, but it does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. In fact, it explicitly states that the sample is not used to derive differentiation scores, implying that there are no conclusive malignant findings. Therefore, I will classify it as "no" (no malignant tumor findings).
3. The statement explicitly mentions that the sample is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e., Gleason scores), which implies that no Gleason grade is reported. Therefore, I will classify it as "NA".
