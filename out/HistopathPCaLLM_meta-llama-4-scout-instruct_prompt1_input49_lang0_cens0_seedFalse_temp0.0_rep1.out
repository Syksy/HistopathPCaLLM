Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports that the most common Gleason class is 3 and the second most common is 4. Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it's reasonable to infer that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, which is a common way to report Gleason grades.
