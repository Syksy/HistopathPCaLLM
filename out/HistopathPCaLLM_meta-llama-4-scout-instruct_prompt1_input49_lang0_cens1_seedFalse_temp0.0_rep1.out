Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "Investigated rest of the prostate samples", which implies that the sample type is likely from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, as it's not a biopsy or TURP. So, I chose "RP" as the sample type.
2. The statement does not mention any malignant tumor findings, and instead mentions that some changes warrant further investigation. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy, I chose "no" for malignancy.
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any other histopathological grading, so I chose "NA" for the Gleason field.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
