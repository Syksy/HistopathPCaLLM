Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement mentions "Investigated rest of the prostate samples", which implies that the sample type is likely from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen, so I chose "RP" as the sample type.
* The statement does not mention any malignant tumor findings, and instead mentions that some changes warrant further investigation, but it does not confirm malignancy, so I chose "no" as the malignancy status.
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any other histopathological details, so I chose "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used for this task: 

 Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possibile due to the technical limitations.
