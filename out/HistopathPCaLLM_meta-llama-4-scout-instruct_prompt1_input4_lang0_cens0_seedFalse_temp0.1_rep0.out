Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", so the value is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that the samples do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma, so the value for malignant tumor findings is set to "no".
3. Since the statement indicates that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value is set to "NA".
