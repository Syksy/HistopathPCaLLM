Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured result:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to the allowed value "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, corresponding to the allowed value "no".
3. Since the statement indicates that the samples are benign and do not contain adenocarcinoma, there is no reported Gleason grade, which corresponds to the allowed value "NA".
