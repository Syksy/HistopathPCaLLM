Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample part", which implies that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. This implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings (i.e., no adenocarcinoma detected), the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
