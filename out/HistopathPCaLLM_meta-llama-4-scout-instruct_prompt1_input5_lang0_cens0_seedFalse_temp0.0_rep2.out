Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and describes specific growth patterns and Gleason grades, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports two different Gleason grades: "4+3" and "4+5=9". Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion, we take the higher sum, which is "4+5=9". 

Note that I ignored the other Gleason grade mentioned ("4+3") as it had a lower sum than the more severe lesion ("4+5=9"). Also, I did not include any information about the proportions of the different architectures, as they were not required for the structured output.
