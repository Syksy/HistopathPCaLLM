Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and provides details about the Gleason grades, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports two different Gleason grades: "4+3" and "4+5=9". Since we need to return the results from the most severe lesion, I chose the higher Gleason sum, which is "4+5=9". 

Note that I did not consider the Gleason grade "4+3" because it has a lower sum (7) compared to "4+5=9". Also, I followed the instruction to provide the Gleason grade in the format "major+minor=sum".
