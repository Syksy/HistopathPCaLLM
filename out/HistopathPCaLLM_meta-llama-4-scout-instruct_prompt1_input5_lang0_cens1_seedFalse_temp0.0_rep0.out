Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as mentioned in the statement "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + cross sections)".
2. There are no clear indications of malignant tumor findings, as the statement mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings". Therefore, I conclude that the answer is "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. The Gleason grade cannot be inferred, as stated in the sentence "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred". Therefore, I conclude that the answer is "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Let me know if this is correct!
