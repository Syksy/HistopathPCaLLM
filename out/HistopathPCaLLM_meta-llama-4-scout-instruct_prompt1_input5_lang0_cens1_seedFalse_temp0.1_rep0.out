Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Samples taken from both apex and basis" and "sections from the left have been processed with yellow dye and sections from right with green dye", which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings", which suggests that no malignant tumor findings were detected. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred", which suggests that the Gleason grade could not be determined. Therefore, the answer is "NA".

Let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
