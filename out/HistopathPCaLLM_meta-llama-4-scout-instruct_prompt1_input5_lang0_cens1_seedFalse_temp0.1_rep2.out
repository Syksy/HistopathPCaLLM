Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" which suggests that the sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings" which suggests that no malignant tumor findings were detected, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" which suggests that the Gleason grade could not be determined, so the answer is "NA".
