Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue casettes", which is most consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the microscopic findings as "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia". There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so the malignancy is classified as "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates a benign condition (prostate hyperplasia) and no malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the value is classified as "NA".
