Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "shaving chips" and "three tissue casettes", which is consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes the microscopic findings as "relatively normal prostate glandular structures" and "hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia". There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, so I classified the malignancy as "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates a benign condition (benign prostate hyperplasia) and no malignant tumor findings, I assigned a Gleason grade of "NA".
