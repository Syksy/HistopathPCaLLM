Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a prostatic operation material, which suggests that the sample type is likely "RP" ( Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings, and the results are inconclusive due to technical challenges. Therefore, I will classify the malignancy as "NA" (Not Available).
3. The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement, and the results are inconclusive. Therefore, I will also classify the Gleason grade as "NA".
