Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a prostatic operation material, which suggests that the sample type is likely "RP" ( Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" due to technical challenges, and there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will classify the malignancy as "NA" (Not Available).
3. Similarly, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I will also classify this as "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
