Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from an operation, which suggests "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement does not provide conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, and in fact, mentions that the results are "inconclusive" due to technical challenges. Therefore, I will classify the malignancy as "NA" (Not Available).
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement, likely due to the inconclusive nature of the results. Therefore, I will also classify the Gleason grade as "NA".
