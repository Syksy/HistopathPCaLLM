Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a prostatic operation material, which suggests that the sample type is likely "RP" ( Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" due to technical challenges, and there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I have classified the malignancy as "NA" (Not Available).
3. Similarly, there is no reported Gleason grade mentioned in the statement, so I have classified it as "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

 Samples consist of very fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material. Albeit fragmented, the material is run in three separate batches. Microscopically, relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed, but majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected due to a heavy burn artefact. The results are therefore inconclusive; due to the technical challenges, re-examination is heavily suggested.
