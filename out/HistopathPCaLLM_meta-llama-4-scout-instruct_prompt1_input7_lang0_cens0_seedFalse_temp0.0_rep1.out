Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, although it's mentioned that the finding is at the suspicion level and not conclusive. However, since adenocarcinoma is mentioned, I will classify this as a malignant tumor finding, and therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade or score, so I will return "NA" for this field. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Also, please provide the raw data for the next statement, and I'll be happy to help.
