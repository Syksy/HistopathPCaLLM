Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the extracted information:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to the allowed value "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, which indicates a malignant tumor finding. Although the finding is described as being on the suspicion-level, the presence of a potential malignant tumor leads to a "yes" classification.
3. The Gleason grade is not reported in the statement, so the value is set to "NA". 

Please let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data for testing was: 
"Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures. /John Doe, Meilahti, 11.11.2011"
