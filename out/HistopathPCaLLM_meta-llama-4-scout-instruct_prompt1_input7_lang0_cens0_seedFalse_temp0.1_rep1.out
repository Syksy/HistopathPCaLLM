Based on the provided statement, I will extract the structured data in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to the allowed value "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, which implies a malignant tumor finding. Although the finding is described as being on the suspicion-level, the presence of a potential malignant tumor leads to a "yes" answer.
3. The Gleason grade is not mentioned in the statement, which is why it's assigned a value of "NA". 

Let me know if you'd like me to process more statements! 

Raw data was not provided in a machine-readable format; however, I was given a sample statement at the end of the instructions. If you provide more statements or raw data, I'd be happy to help.
