Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement mentions that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet", it does suggest adenocarcinoma, which implies a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, I have marked it as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade or score, so I have marked it as "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures. /John Doe, Meilahti, 11.11.2011
