Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that a "prostate sample material" was collected, which implies a biopsy. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "biopsy".
2. The statement describes some atypical structures and morphological changes, but ultimately concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" and that the rest of the material exhibited normal structures. This suggests that there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any specific grading system, which suggests that the sample was not diagnosed with cancer. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
