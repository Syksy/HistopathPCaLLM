Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP" (allowed value).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties" and mentions "malignant findings" indirectly, so I infer that the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason grade as "4+3=7", which matches the preferred format. 

Note that I focused on the most severe lesion, which in this case is the prostatectomy sample (Sample 3). The lymph node samples (Samples 1 and 2) are mentioned as being "free from malignant findings", so they are not relevant for the structured data.
