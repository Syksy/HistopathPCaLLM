Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties" and "malignant findings", indicating the presence of a malignant tumor, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason grade as "4+3=7", which is the highest identified grade, and therefore the value to be reported. 

Note that I ignored the information about the lymph nodes, as it is not relevant to the prostate cancer histopathological statement. I also ignored the high-grade PIN changes and inflammatory changes, as they are not directly related to the requested structured fields.
