Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP" (allowed value).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties" and mentions "malignant findings" indirectly, so I infer that the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason grade as "4+3=7", which matches the preferred format. 

Note that I focused on the most severe lesion, as per your instructions, and ignored the information about the lymph nodes, macrophages, and PIN changes, as they are not directly relevant to the requested structured fields.
