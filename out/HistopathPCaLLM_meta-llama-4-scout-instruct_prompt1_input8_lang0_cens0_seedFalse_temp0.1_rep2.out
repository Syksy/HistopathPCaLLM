Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to "RP" (allowed value).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties" and mentions "malignant findings" indirectly, so I infer that the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason grade as "4+3=7", which matches the preferred format. 

Note that I focused on the most severe lesion, which in this case is the prostatectomy sample with malignant tumor findings. I ignored the information about the lymph nodes, as it seems to be secondary to the primary prostate cancer diagnosis.
