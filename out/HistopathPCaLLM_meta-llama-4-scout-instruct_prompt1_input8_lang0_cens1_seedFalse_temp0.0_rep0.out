Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as mentioned in the phrase "Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol."
2. There are malignant tumor findings, as indicated by the phrases "Examination across the third sample reveals some potentially interesting properties" and "Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus regarding the various options." Although it's not a definitive statement, the presence of "potentially interesting properties" and suspicion of PIN changes implies a possible malignancy, so I will code it as "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is not explicitly stated, and the text mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and "no grade score is reported". Therefore, I will code it as "NA". 

Note that I assumed the sample type to be "biopsy" based on the context, although it's not explicitly stated. If more information were available, this assumption could be confirmed or refuted. 

Also, please let me know if this interpretation aligns with your expectations or if I should revise it.
