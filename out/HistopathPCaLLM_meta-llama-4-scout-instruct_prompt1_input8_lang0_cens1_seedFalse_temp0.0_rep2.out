Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a biopsy, as mentioned in the phrase "prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol" and the context of the indices and samples.
2. There are malignant tumor findings suspected, as indicated by phrases such as "potentially interesting properties", "immunological activity is evident", and "Suspicion of PIN-changes". Although it's not a definitive statement, the tone suggests a possible malignancy, so I will code it as "yes".
3. The reported Gleason grade is not clearly stated, with the phrase "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and the mention of "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor". As no score is provided, I will code it as "NA". 

Please let me know if this is in line with your expectations or if I should revise anything. 

Raw data used: 

 Samples with indices 1 and 2 contain non-primary tissue (multiple segments each), of varying quantities. Sample 3 contains majority of the prostate tissue of interest, which is run according to the routine protocol. Examination across the third sample reveals some potentially interesting properties, and the histological properties illustrate varying growth patterns. The most interesting parts covers approx 10% of the third sample. Immunological activity is evident and normal inflammation related changes are suspected. Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap. Suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus regarding the various options. The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings.
