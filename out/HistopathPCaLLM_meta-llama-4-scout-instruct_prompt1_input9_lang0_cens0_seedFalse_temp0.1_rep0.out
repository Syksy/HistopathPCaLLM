Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which is a common method for obtaining tissue samples during a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I inferred the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed", which directly translates to a "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates that there are no malignant findings and the diagnosis is benign hyperplasia, the Gleason grade is not applicable, resulting in a value of "NA".
