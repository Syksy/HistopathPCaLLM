Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not possible to determine it with certainty. Therefore, I will set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears "rather normal" and that "conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" due to suspected faulty processing of the sample material. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
