Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Chipping samples" which implies a biopsy was taken, so the sample type is "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma", which indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates that the finding is benign and there are no malignancies or carcinoma, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
