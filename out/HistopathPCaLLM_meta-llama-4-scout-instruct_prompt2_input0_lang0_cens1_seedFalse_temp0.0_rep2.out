Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not specify the type of sample, so I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
