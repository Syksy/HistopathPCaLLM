Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not mention a specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
