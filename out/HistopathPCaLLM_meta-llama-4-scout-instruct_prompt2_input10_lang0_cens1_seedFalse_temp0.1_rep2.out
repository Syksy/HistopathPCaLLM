Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention a specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material", which suggests that no malignant tumor findings were present, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
