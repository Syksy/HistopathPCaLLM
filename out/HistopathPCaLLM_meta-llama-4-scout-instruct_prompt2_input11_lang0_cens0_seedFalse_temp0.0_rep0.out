Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a Gleason grading of "4+3", which is a clear and specific value. Therefore, the value is set to "4+3". 

Note that I have followed the instructions to provide a flat JSON structure with no nested structures, and only included the results from the most severe lesion.
