Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate," which implies that the sample type is from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus," indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".

3. **Gleason**: The statement specifies a Gleason grading of "4+3," which directly matches the preferred format for reporting the Gleason grade. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "4+3".
