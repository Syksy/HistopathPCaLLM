Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3"
}
```

Here's how I determined the structured fields:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive tumor tissue" and "malignant focus", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason grading 4+3", which directly provides the required information. Therefore, the value is "4+3".
