Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I assign "NA" as it's not clearly specified.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages, but it does not indicate the presence of a malignant tumor. Additionally, it mentions that the evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. Given the information provided, it seems that there are no clear indications of malignancy, so I assign "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the usual Gleason scores (4 and 3) could not be reliably assessed, as only approximately 5% of the whole material could be investigated. Therefore, I assign "NA" as the Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined.
