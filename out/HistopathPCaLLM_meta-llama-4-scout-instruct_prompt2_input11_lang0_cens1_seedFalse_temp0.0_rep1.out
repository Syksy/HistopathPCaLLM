Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I assign "NA" as it's not clearly specified.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages, but it does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. It also mentions that the evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. Given the absence of clear evidence for malignancy, I assign "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the usual Gleason scores (4 and 3) could not be reliably assessed, as only approximately 5% of the whole material could be investigated. Therefore, I assign "NA" as the Gleason grade cannot be reliably determined.
