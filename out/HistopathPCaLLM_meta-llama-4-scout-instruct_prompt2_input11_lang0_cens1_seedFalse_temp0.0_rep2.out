Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here's my assessment:

* The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, but it appears to be a prostate tissue sample. However, the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not clearly stated, so I will default to "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The statement mentions that the prostate tissue appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages, but it does not explicitly state the presence of cancer. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "NA".
* The Gleason score is mentioned, but it is stated that the usual Gleason scores (4 and 3) could not be reliably assessed. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
