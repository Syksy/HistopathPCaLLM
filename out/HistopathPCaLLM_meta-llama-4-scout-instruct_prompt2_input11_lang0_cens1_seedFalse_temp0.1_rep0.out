Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is classified as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue appears to be forming tubular structures of varying differentiation stages, but it does not indicate the presence of malignant tumor findings. The evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive. Based on this information, it can be inferred that there are no clear malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the usual Gleason scores (4 and 3) could not be reliably assessed, as only a small fraction (approximately 5%) of the material could be investigated. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
