Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, as it mentions "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Therefore, the "Sampletype" is set to "TURP".
2. The statement mentions that the material is classified as "benign", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. Since the material is classified as benign, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, the "Gleason" is set to "NA".
