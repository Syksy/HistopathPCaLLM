Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be from electrosection shavings from the prostate, which is most likely a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "TURP".
2. The statement mentions that the material is classified as benign, and there is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. Since the sample is classified as benign and there is no mention of a malignant tumor or Gleason grading, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
