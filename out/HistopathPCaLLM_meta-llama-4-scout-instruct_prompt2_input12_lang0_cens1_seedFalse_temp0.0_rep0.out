Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it's unclear what "eight batches" refers to. Therefore, I would classify the sample type as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample "consists of prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I would classify the malignancy as "yes".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement. Therefore, I would classify the Gleason grade as "NA". 

Let me know if this is correct!
