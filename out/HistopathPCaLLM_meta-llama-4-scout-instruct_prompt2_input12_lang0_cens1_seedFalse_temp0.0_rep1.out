Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it's unclear if it's a biopsy, RP, TURP, or something else. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample consists of "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "yes".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA". 

Let me know if this is correct!
