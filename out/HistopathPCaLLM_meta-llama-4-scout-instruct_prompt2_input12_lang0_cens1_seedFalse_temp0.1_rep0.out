Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so I would classify it as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample consists of "prostate cancer tissue", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings, so I would answer "yes" for this field.
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, so I would classify it as "NA".

Let me know if this is correct!
