Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I would classify it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that the sample consists of prostate cancer tissue, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I would classify it as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade. Therefore, I would classify it as "NA". 

Note that even though the statement mentions prostate cancer, it does not provide sufficient information to determine the sample type or Gleason grade, which is why I classified them as "NA".
