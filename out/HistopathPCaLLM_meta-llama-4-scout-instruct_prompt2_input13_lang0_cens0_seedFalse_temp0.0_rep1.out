Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma is observed" in sample B, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the carcinoma "reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)". This indicates that the reported Gleason grade is 4+5=9, which is a valid format. Therefore, the value is set to "4+5=9". 

Note that I only considered the most severe lesion, which is the carcinoma observed in sample B with a Gleason score of 4+5=9. The rest of the samples with normal glandular structures are not considered for the structured data.
