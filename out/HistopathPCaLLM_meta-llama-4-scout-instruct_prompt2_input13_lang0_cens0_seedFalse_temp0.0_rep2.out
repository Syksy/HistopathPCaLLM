Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma is observed", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason score 5" and "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)", which provides the necessary information to determine the Gleason grade. The value is set to "4+5=9", which follows the preferred format of "major+minor=sum".
