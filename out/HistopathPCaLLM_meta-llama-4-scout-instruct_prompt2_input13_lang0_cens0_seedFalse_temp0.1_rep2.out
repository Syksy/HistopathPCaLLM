Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma is observed" in sample B, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the carcinoma "reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)". This indicates that the reported Gleason grade is 4+5=9. 

Note that I only considered the results from the most severe lesion (carcinoma in sample B) and ignored the normal glandular structures observed in the rest of the samples.
