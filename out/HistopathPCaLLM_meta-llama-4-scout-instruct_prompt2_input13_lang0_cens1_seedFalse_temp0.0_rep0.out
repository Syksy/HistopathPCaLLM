Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is the most plausible option among the allowed values, so I chose "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "In sample B some irregularities are observed, reaching differentiation patterns that warrant further inspection by a colleague", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I chose "no" for malignancy.
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement, so I chose "NA" for Gleason.
