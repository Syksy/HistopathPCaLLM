Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "The samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate", which suggests that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Although it's not explicitly stated, "biopsy" is the most plausible option among the allowed values, so I chose "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "In sample B some irregularities are observed", but it also states that "at this time further verification is needed via consultation" and that "Rest of the samples seem to exhibit rather ordinary patterns". There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, so I chose "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any information that would suggest a malignant tumor, so I chose "NA" for the Gleason field.
