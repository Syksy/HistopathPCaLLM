Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a radical prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumerous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy field is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". This implies that the Gleason score is 3+4=7, assuming the remaining 40% has a score of 4. 

Note that I made an assumption about the Gleason score based on the provided information, as the exact scores were not explicitly stated. However, this assumption is reasonable based on the description of the tumor.
