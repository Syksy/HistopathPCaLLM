Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy field is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason score of 7, with a larger portion of score 3 (approximately 60%) and implies a score of 4. Therefore, the Gleason field is structured as "3+4=7". 

Note that I assumed a score of 4 as the minor component, as it is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the information provided. If only one score is provided, it is common to represent it as "major+minor" with the minor being an assumed or not provided value, but in the case of total sum provided and two parts, it is safe to assume 3+4.
