Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatetectomy preparate", which implies a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "tumorous growth" and "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma", indicating that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy field is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with "the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7. Note that the exact percentages of the Gleason grades are not provided, but based on the description, a reasonable assumption is that the Gleason score is 3+4=7. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
