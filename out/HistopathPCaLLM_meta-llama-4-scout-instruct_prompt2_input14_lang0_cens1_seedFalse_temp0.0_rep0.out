Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as requested. Here's my analysis:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue" and "samples D-G", "samples K-P", etc. Since it does not specifically mention "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", I will default to "NA".
* The statement mentions "some special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits", but it does not explicitly confirm or rule out malignant tumor findings. However, it does mention a comparison to a "Gleason 7 score patient", which implies that there might be a suspicion of malignancy. Since it's not explicitly stated, I will default to "NA".
* The statement mentions a "Gleason 7 score patient" and proposes that "a more through-out sampling ought to be conducted to be able to rule out mid-grade GG findings". However, it does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for the current sample. Therefore, I will default to "NA".

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
