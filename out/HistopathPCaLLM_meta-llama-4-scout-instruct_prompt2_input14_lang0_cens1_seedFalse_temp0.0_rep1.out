Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will assign "NA" as it's not possible to determine the sample type with certainty.
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, it does not explicitly confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The tone of the statement suggests that further investigation is needed, implying that malignancy is not conclusively determined. Hence, I will assign "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a comparison to a patient with a Gleason 7 score, but it does not provide a conclusive Gleason grade for the current patient. Additionally, it suggests that further investigation is needed to rule out mid-grade GG findings. Therefore, I will assign "NA".
