Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings, and the language used is suggestive of a more thorough investigation being needed, so "Malignancy" is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions a Gleason 7 score patient, but this is in the context of a comparison to another patient, and not a direct report of the Gleason grade for the current sample. Additionally, the statement suggests that further histopathological investigation is needed, implying that a conclusive Gleason grade has not been determined, so "Gleason" is classified as "NA".
