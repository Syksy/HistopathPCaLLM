Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as requested. Here's my analysis:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to "prostate tissue" and "samples". Since it does not specify the type of sample, I will default to "NA".
* The statement mentions "special patterns of cell growth" and "histological traits", but it does not explicitly confirm or rule out malignant tumor findings. However, it does mention a comparison to a "Gleason 7 score patient", which implies that there might be a suspicion of malignancy. Since it's not explicitly stated, I will default to "NA".
* The statement mentions a "Gleason 7 score patient" for comparison, but it does not report a Gleason grade for the current patient. It actually suggests that further investigation is needed to determine the Gleason grade. Therefore, I will default to "NA".

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
