Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, since the statement mentions Gleason 4, but not a complete Gleason score in the format "major+minor=sum", I will revise the answer to:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) since the statement mentions "Prostate chippings" and "shavings".
2. The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, so the answer to "Malignancy" is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as 4, and the sum is mentioned as 8. Since it's not explicitly stated as "4+4=8", but it can be inferred that the most severe lesion has a Gleason score of 4+4=8. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything!
