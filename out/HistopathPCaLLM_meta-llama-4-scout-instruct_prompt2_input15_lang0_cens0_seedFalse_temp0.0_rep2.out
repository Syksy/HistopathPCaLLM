Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, since the Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4" but not in the required format, and there is no minor grade mentioned to form a sum, I will revise the answer to:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate chippings" which implies a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure, so "Sampletype" is set to "TURP".
2. The statement confirms the presence of adenocarcinoma, so "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4" with a sum of "8", which implies a major grade of 4 and no minor grade mentioned, so I inferred "4+4=8" for consistency, but keep in mind that according to the text, it is not exactly in the format requested. 

If one follows the original instruction strictly regarding what can be inferred and not making additional assumptions,  a more conservative response could be 

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
