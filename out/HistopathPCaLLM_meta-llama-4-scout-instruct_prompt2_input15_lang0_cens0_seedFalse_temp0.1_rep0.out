Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, since the Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4" but not in the format of "major+minor=sum", and there is no mention of a second grade, I will try to infer a more accurate answer.

Given that the statement mentions "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8", it can be inferred that the Gleason score is 4+4=8.

Here is the revised JSON:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
