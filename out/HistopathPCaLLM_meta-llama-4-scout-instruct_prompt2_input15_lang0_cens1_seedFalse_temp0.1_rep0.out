Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions a suspected presence of adenocarcinoma, but it is not based on any histopathology, and no conclusive malignant tumor findings are reported. Therefore, the malignancy field is classified as "NA".
3. The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this is not based on any histopathology, and no representative Gleason grade could be determined. Therefore, the Gleason field is classified as "NA".
