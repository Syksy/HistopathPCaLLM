Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions a suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma, but it is not based on any histopathology, and no conclusive malignant tumor findings are reported. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. The statement mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above, but this is not based on any histopathology, and no representative Gleason grade could be determined. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is set to "NA".
