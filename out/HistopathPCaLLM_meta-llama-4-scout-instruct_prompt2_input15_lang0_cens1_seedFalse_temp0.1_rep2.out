Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, the "Sampletype" field is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions a suspected presence of an adenocarcinoma based on clinical notes, but it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor through histopathology. Therefore, the "Malignancy" field is set to "NA".
3. The statement explicitly states that a representative Gleason grade could not be determined at this time. Although it mentions a suspected Gleason sum of 8 or above based on clinical notes, this is not based on any histopathology. Therefore, the "Gleason" field is set to "NA".
