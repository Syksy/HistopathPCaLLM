Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "carcinoma focuses", which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "mainly level 3 grade growth" and "some Gleason 4-type of looping structures", and concludes with a score of 7, which is calculated as 3+4. Therefore, the value is set to "3+4=7".
