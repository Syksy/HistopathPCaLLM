Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement does not provide conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, and the language used is cautious (e.g., "suspicious foci", "inconclusive due to resolution issues"), so it is classified as "NA" for malignancy.
* The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is "inconclusive due to resolution issues" and recommends manual grading on the slides, so it is classified as "NA" for Gleason grade.

Let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything!
