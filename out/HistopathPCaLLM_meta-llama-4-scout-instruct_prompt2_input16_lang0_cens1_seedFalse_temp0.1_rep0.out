Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement does not provide conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, and the language used is cautious (e.g., "suspicious foci", "inconclusive due to resolution issues"), so it is classified as "NA" for malignancy.
* The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues, and that grading ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, so it is classified as "NA" for Gleason grade.
