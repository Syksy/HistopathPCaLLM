Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement does not provide a clear conclusion on the presence of malignant tumor findings, mentioning only that the sample exhibits "patterns" and "various grades of cell differentiation", but not explicitly stating the presence of cancer. Therefore, it is classified as "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is "inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images", and that grading ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization. Therefore, the Gleason grade is classified as "NA".
