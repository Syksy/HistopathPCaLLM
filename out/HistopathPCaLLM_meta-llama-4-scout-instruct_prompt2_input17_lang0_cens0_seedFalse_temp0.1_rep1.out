Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "multiple clear foci" and "the tumor is clearly infiltrating through the capsule to the fat", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3". This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7, which is a common way to report the Gleason score. Therefore, the value is set to "4+3=7".
