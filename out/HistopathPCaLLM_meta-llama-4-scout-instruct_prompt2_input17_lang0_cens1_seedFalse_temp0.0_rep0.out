Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D", but it's unclear what type of sample it is. Therefore, I default to "NA".
2. The statement does not explicitly mention malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", which suggests that there might be some abnormal findings, but it's not clear if they are malignant. Therefore, I default to "NA".
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it's not clear if this is for a specific malignant tumor or not. Additionally, it's not in the preferred format of "major+minor=sum". Therefore, I default to "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a preliminary report that is not providing conclusive results, and therefore, I err on the side of caution and return "NA" for all fields.
