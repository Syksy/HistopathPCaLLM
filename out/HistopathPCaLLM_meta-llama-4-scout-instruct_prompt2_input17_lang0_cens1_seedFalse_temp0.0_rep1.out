Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as requested. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so I default to "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the text seems to focus on the preparation and assessment of the samples rather than reporting specific findings. Therefore, I default to "NA" for malignancy.
* The statement mentions that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it is unclear if this refers to a specific Gleason grade or a range. Moreover, the text does not provide a clear Gleason score, and the assessment is pending. Therefore, I default to "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything!
