Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D", but it's unclear what type of sample it is. Therefore, I default to "NA".
2. The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings. It mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", but it's unclear if this implies malignancy. The text also mentions that the material "can be observed" and that an assessment will be done, but no conclusive findings are reported. Therefore, I default to "NA".
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it's unclear if this is a conclusive finding or just a possibility. Additionally, there is no specific Gleason grade reported in the format "major+minor=sum". Therefore, I default to "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a preliminary or inconclusive report, and it's unclear what specific findings were made. Therefore, I err on the side of caution and default to "NA" for all fields.
