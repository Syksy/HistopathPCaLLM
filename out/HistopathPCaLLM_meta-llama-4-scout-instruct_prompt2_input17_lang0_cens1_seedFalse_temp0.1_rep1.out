Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.), so I default to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement mentions that the material "can be observed" and that differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 "are at all present", but it's not conclusive. Therefore, I default to "NA" for malignancy.
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it's not clear if this is for a specific malignant tumor or if the material is fully healthy. Since there's no conclusive evidence of malignancy, I default to "NA" for the Gleason grade.

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
