Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA). The text mentions "prostate tissue sites" and "samples A-D", but it's unclear what type of sample it is. Therefore, I default to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. The text mentions "differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present", but it's not clear if this implies malignancy. The tone of the text suggests that the assessment is still pending, and the results are not conclusive. Therefore, I default to "NA".
3. The statement mentions Gleason grades between 3 to 5, but it's not clear if this is a conclusive result or just a possibility. Additionally, there is no specific Gleason score (e.g., "4+3=7") mentioned. Therefore, I default to "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a preliminary report that is not conclusive, and the results are pending further assessment and discussion. As such, I have defaulted to "NA" for all three fields.
