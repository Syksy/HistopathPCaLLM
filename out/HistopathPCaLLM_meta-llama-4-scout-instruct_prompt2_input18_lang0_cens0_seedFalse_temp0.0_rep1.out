Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```

However, after reevaluating the statement I found that a Gleason sum is mentioned: 

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7" 
}
```
or 
```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
}
```
Since we do not know which one is major and which one is minor I will pick one.

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7" 
}
```
