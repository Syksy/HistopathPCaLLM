Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after reevaluating the statement, I noticed that a Gleason sum is mentioned: "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7...". Since the statement mentions a Gleason sum, I will update the structured data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
or 
```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
Both are valid. But lets assume that  "larger fraction with stage 3" means  major part has 3 and  minor part has 4 

So 

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
