Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```

However, after reevaluating the statement I found that a Gleason sum is mentioned: 

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "7" 
}
```
