Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after reevaluating the statement I think a more accurate answer would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
or 
```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
Both 3+4 and 4+3 would result in a Gleason sum of 7. Since the statement mentions that "The portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic has Gleason sum 7", and that  "the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area", a more accurate answer would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
