Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement reports that sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4: Gleason 3 (approx 90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). This can be represented as a sum of 3+4=7, which is a common way to express the Gleason grade. Therefore, the value is set to "3+4=7".
