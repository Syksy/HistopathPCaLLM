Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", so the sample type is clearly "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement reports that sample 4 contains "adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the adenocarcinoma in sample 4 as having Gleason grades 3 (approx 90%) and 4 (10%). This can be represented as "3+4=7". 

Note that I assumed the Gleason grade is approximately 3+4=7, as the exact percentages are not explicitly stated. If more precise information were available, the Gleason grade could be reported more accurately. However, based on the provided text, "3+4=7" is a reasonable interpretation.
