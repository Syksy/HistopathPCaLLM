Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement reports that "sample 4... appears to contain adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4: "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". This information can be interpreted as a Gleason score of 3+4=7. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is set to "3+4=7". 

Note that I have focused on the most severe lesion, which in this case is the adenocarcinoma found in sample 4. I have ignored the benign findings in samples 2 and 3.
