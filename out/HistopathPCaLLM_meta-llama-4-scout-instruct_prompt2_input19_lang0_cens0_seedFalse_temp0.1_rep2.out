Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "targeted prostate biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "sample 4... appears to contain adenocarcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the adenocarcinoma has "Gleason 3, approx 90%" and "Gleason 4, 10%". This can be interpreted as a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Therefore, the value is set to "3+4=7".
