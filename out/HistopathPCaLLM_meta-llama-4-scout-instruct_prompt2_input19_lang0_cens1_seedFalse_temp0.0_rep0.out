Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, and it is unclear which sample type is being referred to. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that sample 4 may contain "cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue" and that it is "possibly malignant". However, it is not a definitive statement of malignancy, and the quality control suggests uncertainty. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".

Note that the statement is not a clear histopathological report, and it appears to be a description of a quality control process. As such, it is not possible to extract definitive information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade.
