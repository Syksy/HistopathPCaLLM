Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type cannot be determined with certainty, as the statement mentions that the samples were divided into batches and one sample (sample 4) may have been mixed with non-prostate tissue or is possibly abnormal prostate tissue. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings, as it only mentions that sample 4's tissue "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and that it is "possibly malignant". However, it also mentions that the lab trajectory will be verified before proceeding further, indicating that no conclusive diagnosis has been made. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade mentioned in the statement, as the focus is on verifying the lab trajectory and further investigation is needed to determine the histopathology. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
