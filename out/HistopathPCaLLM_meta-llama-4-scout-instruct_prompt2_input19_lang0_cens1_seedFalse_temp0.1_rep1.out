Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type cannot be determined with certainty, as the statement mentions that the samples were divided into batches and some samples represent healthy benign prostate tissue, while one sample may be abnormal but its lab trajectory needs to be verified. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement only mentions that sample 4's tissue architecture may differ from normal prostate tissue, but it is uncertain whether this is truly abnormal or a lab mishap. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade, as the statement does not provide any information about Gleason grading. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
