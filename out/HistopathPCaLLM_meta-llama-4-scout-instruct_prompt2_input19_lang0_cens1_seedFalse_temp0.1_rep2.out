Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type cannot be determined with certainty, as the statement mentions that the samples were divided into batches and one of the samples (sample 4) may have been mixed with non-prostate tissue or is possibly abnormal prostate tissue. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, as the statement only mentions that sample 4's tissue "may differ from normal prostate tissue" and that it is "possibly malignant". However, this is not conclusive, and further verification is required. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade, as the statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grading of the samples. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
