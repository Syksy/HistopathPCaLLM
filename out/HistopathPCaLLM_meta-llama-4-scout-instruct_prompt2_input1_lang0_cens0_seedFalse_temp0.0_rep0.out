Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "needle biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The conclusion of the statement is that "only benign-like growth is observed", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that only benign-like growth is observed, there is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
