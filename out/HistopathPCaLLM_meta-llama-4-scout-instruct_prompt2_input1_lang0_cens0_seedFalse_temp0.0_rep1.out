Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes that "only benign-like growth is observed", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates that the growth is benign and there is no mention of a Gleason grade, the value is set to "NA".
