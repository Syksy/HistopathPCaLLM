Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" and that "additional inspection is required regarding malignancy", which implies that no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement also mentions that the results are inconclusive regarding "clinically significant Gleason findings", which implies that no Gleason grade can be determined. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
