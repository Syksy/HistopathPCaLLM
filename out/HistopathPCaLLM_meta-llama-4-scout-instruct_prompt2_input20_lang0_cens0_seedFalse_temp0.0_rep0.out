Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection". This matches with the allowed value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is a surgical procedure where the prostate gland is removed. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma (a type of malignant tumor) in both the apex and basis of the prostate. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "yes".

3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in both the apex and basis. It mentions that the longitudinal section from the apex shows adenocarcinoma "fitting best into the Gleason 3+4 staging", and the basis presents "mostly with class 4+4". Since the task is to provide results from the most severe lesion, the higher Gleason grade of 4+4=8 is used. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "4+4=8". 

This structured data reflects the most severe lesion's characteristics as requested.
