Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection". This corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) in the allowed values.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports Gleason grades of 3+4 and 4+4. Since we are only interested in the results from the most severe lesion, we take the higher grade, which is 4+4=8. 

Note that I chose the higher Gleason grade (4+4=8) over 3+4=7 as it represents the most severe lesion. If both grades were equally severe or if 3+4 was specifically mentioned as the more representative grade, I would have used that instead. However, based on standard Gleason grading, 4+4 is a more severe lesion than 3+4.
