Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection". This corresponds to the value "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is one of the allowed values.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both the apex and basis, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports Gleason grades of 3+4 and 4+4. Since we are only interested in the most severe lesion, we take the higher grade, which is 4+4=8. 

Note that I chose the more severe Gleason grade (4+4) over the 3+4 mentioned in the statement, as it represents the most severe lesion.
