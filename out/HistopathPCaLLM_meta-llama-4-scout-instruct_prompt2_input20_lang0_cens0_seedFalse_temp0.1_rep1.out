Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the presented sample is a "prostatectomy resection". This corresponds to the abbreviation "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy), which is one of the allowed values.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" in both the apex and basis of the prostatectomy sample. This indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for both the apex and the basis. For the apex, it suggests a Gleason grade of "3+4", and for the basis, it suggests "4+4". Since the task is to provide results from the most severe lesion and both are reported with their sums, the most severe based on the provided Gleason scores would be "4+4=8". 

Therefore, the structured data reflects the most severe lesion found in the sample.
