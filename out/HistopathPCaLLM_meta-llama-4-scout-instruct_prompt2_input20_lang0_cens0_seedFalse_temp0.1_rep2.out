Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection," which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma in samplings from both the apex and basis of the prostate. This means there are malignant tumor findings, so the value for "Malignancy" is "yes".

3. **Gleason**: The statement provides Gleason grades for the adenocarcinoma found in the apex and basis. For the apex, it mentions "Gleason 3+4 staging," and for the basis, it mentions "class 4+4." Since the task is to provide results from the most severe lesion and both are reported with their Gleason scores, the most severe based on the Gleason score sum would be 4+4=8. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "4+4=8". 

This structured data reflects the information from the most severe lesion as requested.
