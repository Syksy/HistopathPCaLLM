Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). The sample type is not clearly mentioned, so I will assign "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, which have affected cell morphology. However, it does not confirm the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will assign "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of 3+4, but this is not a confirmed finding. The statement explicitly states that assessment of the prostate tissue is impossible due to the therapies given. Therefore, I will assign "NA".

Overall, the statement is inconclusive, and it's not possible to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade with certainty. Hence, the structured result is "NA" for all fields.
