Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.). Therefore, I conclude that the sample type is "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region, which have affected cell morphology. This implies that there is no conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I conclude that the malignancy is "NA" (not available).
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that even in a hypothetical scenario, a lower-level Gleason grade (such as 3+4) could be found, but this is not a confirmed finding. Therefore, I conclude that the Gleason grade is "NA" (not available).

Overall, the statement is inconclusive and does not provide sufficient information to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade with certainty. Hence, I have assigned "NA" values to all three fields.
