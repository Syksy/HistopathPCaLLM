Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as requested. 

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it does mention "prostate tissue samples". However, it also mentions that the samples have been "highly affected" by previous therapies, making it impossible to examine for adenocarcinoma. 

There is no explicit mention of malignant tumor findings, but the statement does mention "possible adenocarcinoma" and "cell differentiation staging", which implies that there might be some suspicion of malignancy, but it's not conclusive.

The statement mentions Gleason grade (e.g., "3+4") but only in a hypothetical scenario, and it's not clear if this is a actual finding or just a speculative example.

Given the information provided, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* "Sampletype" is set to "NA" because the statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP).
* "Malignancy" is set to "NA" because the statement does not provide conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, and the suspicion of adenocarcinoma is mentioned in a hypothetical scenario.
* "Gleason" is set to "NA" because the statement only mentions Gleason grade in a speculative example, and not as an actual finding.
