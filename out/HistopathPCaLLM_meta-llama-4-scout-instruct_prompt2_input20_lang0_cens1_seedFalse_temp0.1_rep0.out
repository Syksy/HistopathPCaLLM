Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples have been obtained, but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). The sample type is not clearly mentioned, and the text suggests that the samples have been affected by previous therapies, making it difficult to determine the sample type. Therefore, I will assign "NA" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions the possibility of adenocarcinoma, but it is not possible to confirm due to the therapies given in the region, which have affected cell morphology. The text does not provide conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, so I will assign "NA" to this field.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of 3+4, but this is not a confirmed finding. Since there is no conclusive evidence of malignant tumor findings, I will assign "NA" to this field.

Overall, the statement is not a clear histopathological report, and it is not possible to extract definitive information about the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade. Therefore, I have assigned "NA" to all fields.
