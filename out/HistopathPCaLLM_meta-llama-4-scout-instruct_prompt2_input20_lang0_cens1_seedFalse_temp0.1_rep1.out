Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here's my attempt:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

My reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the original sample type (e.g., "biopsy", "RP", "TURP"), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected by previous therapies, making it impossible to examine for possible adenocarcinoma. This implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, but it's not a definitive statement. To be conservative, I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
3. The statement mentions a hypothetical scenario with a Gleason grade of 3+4, but this is not a confirmed finding. Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, I set "Gleason" to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise my interpretation!
