Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is most consistent with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample type.
2. **Malignancy**: The presence of "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "nucleoli are clearly visible" are indicative of malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports the "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4", which suggests a Gleason score of 5+4=9. 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the process!
