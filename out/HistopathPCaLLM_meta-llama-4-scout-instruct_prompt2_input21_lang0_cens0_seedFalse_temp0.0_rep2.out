Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is commonly associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is inferred as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "nucleoli are clearly visible", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is classified as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports the "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". In the context of Gleason grading, this information is often used to represent the primary and secondary grades, which are then added to obtain a sum. Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "5+4=9".
