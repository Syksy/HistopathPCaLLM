Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is commonly associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma", "enlarged nuclei", and "nucleoli are clearly visible", which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classified the malignancy as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports the "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". Although it does not explicitly state the sum, it can be inferred that the Gleason grade is 5+4=9. 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
