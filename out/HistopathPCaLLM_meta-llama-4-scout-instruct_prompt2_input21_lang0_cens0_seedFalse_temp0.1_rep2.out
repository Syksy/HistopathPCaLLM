Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostate chippings" which is a common terminology for TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) samples. Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma" with "enlarged, varying in size" nuclei and "clearly visible" nucleoli, which are indicative of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I classified the malignancy as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports the "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". Although it doesn't explicitly state the sum, it's reasonable to infer that the Gleason grade is 5+4=9, which is a common way to report the Gleason score.
