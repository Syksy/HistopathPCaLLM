Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not clearly indicate the original sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and the description of the material is too vague, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns, making it impossible to determine if there are malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement also mentions that the material is too noisy to assess Gleason grade, and additional QC is recommended, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
