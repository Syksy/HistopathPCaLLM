Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not clearly indicate the original sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and the description of the material is too vague, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the material is not suitable for assessment due to technical issues (e.g., "nuclei are dissolved", "technical noise confounds assessment"), and therefore, it is not possible to determine if there are malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* Similarly, the statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade, and the material is not considered suitable for assessment, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
