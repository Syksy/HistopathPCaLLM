Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is unclear what type of sample it is. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the material is "noisy" and that technical issues confound assessment of cell differentiation patterns, making it impossible to determine if there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade, and it is unclear if the material can be evaluated for Gleason grading. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
