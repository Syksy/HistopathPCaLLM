Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth" on the left side, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4 on the left side, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is set to "3+4=7". 

Note that I only considered the results from the most severe lesion, which in this case is the left side with carcinoma tissue structures and Gleason scores of 3 and 4. The right side, which does not exhibit signs of malignancies, is not considered for the structured data.
