Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate thick needle biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "carcinoma tissue structures" and "cancerous growth" on the left side, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores of 3 and 4 on the left side, which corresponds to a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. This is the most severe lesion reported, and therefore, this value is used. 

Note that the right side fragments do not exhibit signs of malignancies, but the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion, which is on the left side.
