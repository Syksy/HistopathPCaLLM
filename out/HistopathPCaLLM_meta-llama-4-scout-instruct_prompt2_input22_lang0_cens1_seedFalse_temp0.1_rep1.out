Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their highly fragmented and varying nature, which implies that no malignant tumor findings can be confirmed. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
3. The statement mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures and that proof-checking is needed to ensure the material's origin and conservation. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
