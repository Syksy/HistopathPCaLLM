Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not clearly indicate the original sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is mentioned that the material's origin from the prostate needs to be verified. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that the samples "cannot be assessed for malignancies" due to their highly fragmented and varying nature. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement also mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult due to the wide range of cell architectures, and that the samples need to be reprocessed. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
