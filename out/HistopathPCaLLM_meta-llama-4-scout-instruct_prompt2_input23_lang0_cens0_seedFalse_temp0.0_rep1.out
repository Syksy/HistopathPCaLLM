Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "an adenocarcinoma", which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports a Gleason score sum of 9, with a primary grade of 4 (60% of the tumor), a secondary grade of 5 (approximately 30% of the tumor), and a tertiary grade of 3 (of minimal area). The Gleason score is typically reported as the sum of the primary and secondary grades, which in this case is 4+5=9. Therefore, the value is set to "4+5=9".
