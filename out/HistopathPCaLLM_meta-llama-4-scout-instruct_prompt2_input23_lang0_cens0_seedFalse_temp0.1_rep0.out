Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason-score sum 9" and provides information about the different grades: "mainly differentiation stage 4 (60%)" and "second most common stage 5 (approx 30%)". This implies that the Gleason grade is 4+5=9. 

Note that I've ignored the tertiary grade (class 3) mentioned as "diminishingly small", as the problem statement asks for the results from the most severe lesion, which in this case is the 4+5=9 grading.
