Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I derived the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate," which implies that the sample type is from a Radical Prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions "an adenocarcinoma," which indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, the malignancy finding is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement provides detailed information about the tumor's differentiation stages and concludes with a Gleason score sum of 9, which corresponds to a grade group of 5. The primary and secondary grades are mentioned as 4 (60%) and 5 (approximately 30%), respectively. Therefore, the Gleason grade is structured as "4+5=9".
