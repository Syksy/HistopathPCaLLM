Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, and it seems that the sample is being reprocessed for further investigation. Therefore, the sample type is not clearly identified, and I would classify it as "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the statement. The mention of "potential Gleason 3 findings" is not conclusive, and the report is incomplete. Therefore, I would classify the malignancy as "NA".
* The Gleason grade is mentioned as "potential Gleason 3 findings", but this is not a conclusive result. Therefore, I would classify the Gleason grade as "NA".
