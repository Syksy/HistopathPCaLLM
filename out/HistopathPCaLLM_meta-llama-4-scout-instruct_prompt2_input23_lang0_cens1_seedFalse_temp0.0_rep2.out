Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the original sample type, and it seems that the sample is being reprocessed, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement is more focused on the process of reprocessing the sample, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions a prior report of potential Gleason 3 findings, but this is not a conclusive result, and the sample is being reprocessed to validate the initial suspicions. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
