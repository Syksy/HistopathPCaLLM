Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the original sample type, and it is unclear what type of sample it is. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement does not provide any information about malignant tumor findings. It only mentions potential Gleason 3 findings in a prior incomplete report, but this is not conclusive evidence of malignancy. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions potential Gleason 3 findings, but this is not a conclusive Gleason grade. Additionally, there is no clear indication of a malignant tumor, so a Gleason grade cannot be accurately reported. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
