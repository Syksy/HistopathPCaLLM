Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after re-reading the statement, I found that a Gleason sum is mentioned: "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." But it does not provide the detailed Gleason grade in the format "major+minor=sum". Assuming the Gleason sum is 8, but without the detailed grade, I will keep it as NA for now.

If more information is available or a more detailed analysis is performed, the Gleason grade could potentially be updated. However, based on the current information:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
