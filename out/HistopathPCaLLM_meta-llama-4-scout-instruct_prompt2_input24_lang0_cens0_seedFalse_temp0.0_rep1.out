Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after re-reading the statement, I noticed that a Gleason grade is mentioned: "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a sum: "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Assuming the Gleason grade is 4 and the sum is 8, but there is no minor grade mentioned, I will try to find a matching format.

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
