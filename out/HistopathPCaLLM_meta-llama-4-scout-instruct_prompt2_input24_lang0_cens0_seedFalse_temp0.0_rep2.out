Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```

However, a more accurate representation would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "8" 
}
```

Since the statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma", it implies a Gleason score of 8, but it does not provide a clear "major+minor=sum" format. If you would like to keep it as "NA" for consistency with the format, the first JSON would be the output. 

But based on information given and standard practices in reporting Gleason scores I would argue the second is more accurate. 

Let me know if I should make adjustments.
