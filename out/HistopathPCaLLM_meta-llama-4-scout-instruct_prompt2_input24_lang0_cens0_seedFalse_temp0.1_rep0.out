Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```

However, a more suitable answer would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

This is because the statement mentions "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma", which implies a Gleason grade of 4+4=8. 

Let me know if this is correct or if I should adjust anything! 

In case you need further assistance or have more statements you'd like me to process, feel free to ask! 

Raw data provided in your message: 

"The sample consists of comfirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings, of which about half are run via 6 tissue casettes. In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth. Some degree of chronically inflammated tissue is also present. SUMMARY: Formerly benignly classified sample with a malignant suspicion had its chippings re-evaluated, now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma."
