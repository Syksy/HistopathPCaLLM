Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA" 
}
```

However, a more accurate representation would be:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "8" 
}
```

The statement mentions that the sample consists of TURP-chippings, indicating that the original sample type is indeed "TURP". The presence of "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and the SUMMARY stating "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma" implies that there are malignant tumor findings, hence "Malignancy" is "yes". Although the exact Gleason grade is mentioned as "Gleason 4", the SUMMARY provides a sum of 8, which can be interpreted as "4+4=8". Since the problem statement prefers the format "major+minor=sum", but only a sum is provided, I used "8" as the Gleason grade. If more information were available, it could be represented as "4+4=8". 

However, based on provided instructions that say use  "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers, and only  "sum"  was inferable  here  - so  I kept  it simple as 

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "8" 
}
```
