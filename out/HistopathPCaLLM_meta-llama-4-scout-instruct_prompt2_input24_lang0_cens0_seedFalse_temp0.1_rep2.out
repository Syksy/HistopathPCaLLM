Based on the provided statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

However, after re-reading the statement, I noticed that a Gleason grade is mentioned: "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and a sum: "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma". Although it is not in the preferred format, I will try to extract the information.

Assuming the Gleason grade is 4 and there is another grade not explicitly mentioned but implied to be part of the sum of 8, I will make an educated guess.

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
