Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the structured data. Since the statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample, but rather describes a collection of samples used for teaching purposes, I will return "NA" for most fields.

Here is the structured result in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not provide information about a specific sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so I return "NA".
* The statement mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", implying that the samples were not malignant, but it does not provide a clear answer about malignant tumor findings, so I return "NA".
* The statement mentions Gleason scores (e.g., 3+3, 3+4, 6), but not in the context of a specific patient's malignant tumor, so I return "NA".
