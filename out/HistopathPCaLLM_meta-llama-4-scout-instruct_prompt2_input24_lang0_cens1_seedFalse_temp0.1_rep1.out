Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not provide specific information about a single patient's sample type, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the material was "post-benign diagnosis", implying that the samples were not malignant, but it's not clear if there were any malignant cases in the dataset. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* There is no specific Gleason grade mentioned for a malignant tumor, and the statement mentions that the material was "low grade" and had Gleason scores such as 3+3 or 3+4, but these are not specific to a single patient. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
