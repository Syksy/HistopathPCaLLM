Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

However, the statement does not explicitly provide a Gleason score in the format "major+minor=sum". But it does provide the patterns and percentages. Assuming the Gleason score can be calculated or inferred from the given patterns and percentages, here's a more accurate representation:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

can be kept as it seems that 4 and 3 are the most relevant numbers given for the Gleason grading.

But if we are to follow the instructions to the letter and not make any assumptions beyond what is given:

A more conservative and accurate approach would consider what is explicitly stated and what can be reliably inferred:

Given that we have to stick to the format and provide an answer based on what seems to be the most severe or relevant lesion and considering standard practices in Gleason grading:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
