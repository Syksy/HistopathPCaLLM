Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

However, the statement does not explicitly provide a Gleason score in the format "major+minor=sum". But it does provide the patterns: 

- Sample (1) contains Gleason 4 pattern 20% and 3 pattern approx 30%. 
- Sample (2) contains Gleason 4 approx 15% and 3 stage less than 35%.

Given that the most severe lesion is usually considered for Gleason grading and assuming the percentages can be used to estimate a dominant pattern, a common interpretation would focus on the higher grades present. 

A more accurate interpretation, given typical Gleason grading, might focus on identifying the most significant patterns which could suggest a Gleason score, but without explicit percentages or clear major and minor patterns directly stated for a final Gleason sum, a conservative approach would consider what's directly inferable.

Given the information and focusing on clarity and direct inference:
 
The presence of malignancy is confirmed ("yes"), the sample type appears to be a biopsy, and while the exact Gleason grading summing isn't directly provided, we can infer from patterns but will follow the instruction for clarity and simplicity.

Therefore, focusing on required output and typical expectations for structured data from such statements:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
