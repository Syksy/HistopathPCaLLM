Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not clearly indicate the original sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma (malignancy) cannot be reliably verified, so it is classified as "NA" for malignancy.
* There is no reported Gleason grade or any information that would allow for a reliable Gleason grading, so it is classified as "NA" for Gleason grade.
