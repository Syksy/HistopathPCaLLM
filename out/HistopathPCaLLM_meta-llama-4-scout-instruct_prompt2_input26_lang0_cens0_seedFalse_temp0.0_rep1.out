Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions a "widely spread tumor", indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent". This suggests a Gleason grade of 3+4=7. 

Note that I've made an educated guess about the Gleason grade, as the statement doesn't explicitly provide a sum. However, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to infer that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. If more information were available, a more precise Gleason grade might be determinable.
