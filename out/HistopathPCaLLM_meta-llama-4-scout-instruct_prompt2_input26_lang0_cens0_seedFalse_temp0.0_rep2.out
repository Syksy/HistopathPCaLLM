Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the "studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly mentions that "histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "the dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent". This implies that the Gleason grade is a combination of 3 and 4. Although the exact sum is not explicitly stated, it can be reasonably inferred that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7, which is a common way to report Gleason grades.
