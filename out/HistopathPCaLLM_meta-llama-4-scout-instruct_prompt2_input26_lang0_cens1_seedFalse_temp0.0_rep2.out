Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement mentions that the histopathology cannot be reasonably used to assess treatment trajectory, so "Malignancy" is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions a possible "Gleason sum 7", but it is unclear if this is verified, and the histopathology is not reliable due to recent radiation therapy, so "Gleason" is classified as "NA".
