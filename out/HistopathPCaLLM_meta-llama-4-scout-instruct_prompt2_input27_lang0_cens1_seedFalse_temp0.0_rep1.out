Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set it to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the growth patterns in most samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation, but it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. The mention of a possible Gleason score of 3 in small quantities is not sufficient to confirm malignancy. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. The statement mentions a possible Gleason score of 3, but it is not conclusive, and the quantities are small. Since the statement does not provide a clear Gleason grade, I set it to "NA".
