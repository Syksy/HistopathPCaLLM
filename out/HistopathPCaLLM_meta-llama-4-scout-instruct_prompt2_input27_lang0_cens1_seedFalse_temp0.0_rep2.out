Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it's classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the growth patterns in most samples did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation, but it does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. The mention of a possible Gleason score of 3 in small quantities is not sufficient to confirm malignancy. Therefore, it's classified as "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. The statement mentions a possible Gleason score of 3, but it's not a definitive or significant finding, and it's not clear if it's related to a malignant tumor. Therefore, it's classified as "NA" for the Gleason grade.
