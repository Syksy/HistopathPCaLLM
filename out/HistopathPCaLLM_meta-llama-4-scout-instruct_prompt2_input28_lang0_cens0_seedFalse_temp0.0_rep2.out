Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "six biopsy cylinders", which clearly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes multiple foci with adenocarcinoma, which is a type of malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "yes" for malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports multiple Gleason grades, but we are only interested in the most severe lesion. Focus #1 has a Gleason classification of 4+4=8, which is the highest grade reported. Therefore, the structured answer for Gleason is "4+4=8".
