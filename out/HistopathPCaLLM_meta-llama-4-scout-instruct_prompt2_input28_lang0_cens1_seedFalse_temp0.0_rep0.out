Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions "atypical growth patterns", "odd growth patterns", and "possible pre-malignant changes", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. The statement explicitly says that the material is sent for further evaluation, implying that the findings are not conclusive. Therefore, it is classified as "no" for malignancy.
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement, so it is classified as "NA".
