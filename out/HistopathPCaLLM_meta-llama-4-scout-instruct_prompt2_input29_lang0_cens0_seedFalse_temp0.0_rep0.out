Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that a "prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes the sampling process, which suggests that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" and describes the tumor characteristics, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a "SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections" and describes the tumor differentiation patterns as "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 3". This information suggests that the Gleason grade is 4+3=7. 

Note that I inferred the Gleason grade based on the provided information, assuming that the "grade 4 differentiation pattern" corresponds to the major grade and the "smaller portion as grade 3" corresponds to the minor grade. If this interpretation is incorrect, please let me know and I'll be happy to revise the structured data.
