Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that a "prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" and describes the sampling process, which suggests that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the value is set to "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma" and describes the tumor characteristics, which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 3" and provides a summary score sum of "7". This information can be translated to a Gleason grade of "4+3=7". 

Note that I inferred the Gleason grade based on the provided information, assuming that the grade 4 and grade 3 patterns correspond to the major and minor components, respectively. If more specific information were available, the Gleason grade might be reported differently. However, based on the provided text, the above-structured data seems to be the most accurate representation.
