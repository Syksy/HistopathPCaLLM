Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is unclear what type of sample was collected. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement does not provide clear evidence of malignant tumor findings. Although it mentions that samples A and C are of particular interest and may have potential poor differentiation and possible fusing glandular structure observations, it is not conclusive. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible" and that samples A and C need to be re-examined. This implies that a Gleason grade could not be determined. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
