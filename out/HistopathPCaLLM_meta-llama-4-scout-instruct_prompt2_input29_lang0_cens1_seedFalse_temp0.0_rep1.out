Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement does not provide clear information about malignant tumor findings. Although it mentions "tumor cells," it is not clear if the findings are malignant or not. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible" and that samples need to be re-examined. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
