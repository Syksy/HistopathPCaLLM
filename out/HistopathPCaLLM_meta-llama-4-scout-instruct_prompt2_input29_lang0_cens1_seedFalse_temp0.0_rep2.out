Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement does not provide clear information about malignant tumor findings. Although it mentions "tumor cells," it is not clear if the findings are malignant or not, and the assessment of differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be done due to contamination. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly states that "Score sum determination was not possible" due to contamination and the need for re-examination of samples A and C. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
