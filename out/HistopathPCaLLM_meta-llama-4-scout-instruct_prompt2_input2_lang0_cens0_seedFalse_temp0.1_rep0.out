Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen," which indicates that the original sample type is a prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "RP".

2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic description mentions "normal benign growth," "atrophy," "spot-like inflammation," and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia," but there is no mention of malignant tumor findings. The summary also states that the tissue changes can be attributed to "normal aging" and mentions "at most a low inflammatory state," with no indication of cancer. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade, which is used to grade prostate cancer, is not applicable. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
