Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen", which indicates that the original sample type is a prostatectomy (RP). Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic examination reveals "normal benign growth", "atrophy", "spot-like inflammation", and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia", but no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
