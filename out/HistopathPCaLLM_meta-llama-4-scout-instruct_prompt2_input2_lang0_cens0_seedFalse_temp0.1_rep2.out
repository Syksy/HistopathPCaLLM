Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy specimen", which corresponds to "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) in the provided allowed values.
2. **Malignancy**: The microscopic description mentions "normal benign growth", "atrophy", "spot-like inflammation", and "growth suggestive of hyperplasia", but there is no mention of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant tumor findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, and the answer is "NA".
