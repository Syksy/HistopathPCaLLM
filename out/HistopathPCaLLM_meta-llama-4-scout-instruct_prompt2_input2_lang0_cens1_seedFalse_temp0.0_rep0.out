Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other specific type, and it is mentioned that the sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen. Therefore, I classify the sample type as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that there are inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples, and that further inspection and sample re-runs are required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. This implies that no malignant tumor findings are confirmed, so I classify the malignancy as "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any specific grading of the sample, so I classify the Gleason grade as "NA".
