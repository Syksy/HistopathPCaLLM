Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type cannot be determined as the statement mentions it is from an autopsy specimen, not specifically a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the sample material exhibits inflammatory and age-related changes, but no clear evidence of malignant tumor findings is reported. It even suggests that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade in the statement, as it mentions that further inspection and sample re-runs are required. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
