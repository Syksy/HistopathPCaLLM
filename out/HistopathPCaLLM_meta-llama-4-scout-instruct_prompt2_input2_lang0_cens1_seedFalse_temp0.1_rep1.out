Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or a clear description that would allow inferring one of these options. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that there are inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples and that further inspection is required to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. This implies that no clear malignant tumor findings are present based on the current inspection. Hence, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no specific Gleason grade mentioned in the statement. Given that the findings are not reliable due to dominating inflammatory and age-related changes and that the sample might be marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
