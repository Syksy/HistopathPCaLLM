Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

1. The sample type cannot be determined as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP" since it is mentioned that the sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions that there are inflammatory and age-related changes dominating the samples, and further findings cannot be reliably inferred. However, it does mention that the samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes. Since no clear malignant tumor findings are reported, the answer is "no".
3. There is no reported Gleason grade, so the answer is "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more data!
