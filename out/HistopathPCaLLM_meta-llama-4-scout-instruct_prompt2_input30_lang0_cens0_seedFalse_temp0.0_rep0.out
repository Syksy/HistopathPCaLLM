Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I assigned the value "TURP" to this field.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" and "Grade Group 3 after revision", which clearly indicates the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, I assigned the value "yes" to this field.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "differentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5" and "updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1)". Although the statement doesn't explicitly mention the Gleason score in the format "major+minor=sum", it does provide enough information to infer that the Gleason score is 4+3=7 (as Grade Group 3 corresponds to a Gleason score of 7). Therefore, I assigned the value "4+3=7" to this field.
