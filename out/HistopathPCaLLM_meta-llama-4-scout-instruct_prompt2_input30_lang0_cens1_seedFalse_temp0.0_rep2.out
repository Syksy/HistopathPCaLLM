Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this structured response is as follows:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP, etc.), so it is classified as "NA" (Not Available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "uncertain diagnosis" and "suspicions" but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, it is classified as "NA" because it neither confirms nor denies malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement, so it is also classified as "NA".
