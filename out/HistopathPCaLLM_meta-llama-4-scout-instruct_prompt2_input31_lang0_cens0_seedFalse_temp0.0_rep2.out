Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that the patient had undergone a "routine systematic biopsy" and later "two targeted biopsies". Therefore, the original sample type is a "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that a "minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6 was found" and later a "large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4" was found. This indicates that there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the second targeted biopsy showed a "primary differentiation pattern 4" and the "second most common differentiation pattern is 5". This suggests that the Gleason grade is 4+5=9, which is a more severe lesion than the initially reported Gleason sum 6. Therefore, I have used the Gleason grade from the most severe lesion.
