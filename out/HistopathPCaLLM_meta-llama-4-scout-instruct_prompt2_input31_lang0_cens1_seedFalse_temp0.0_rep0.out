Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions "suspicious findings", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumors. The findings are described as encompassing only 5% of the original samples, and the interpretation of the tissue is reported as difficult. Therefore, it is unclear if there are malignant tumor findings, and the answer is classified as "NA".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score in the statement, so it is classified as "NA".
