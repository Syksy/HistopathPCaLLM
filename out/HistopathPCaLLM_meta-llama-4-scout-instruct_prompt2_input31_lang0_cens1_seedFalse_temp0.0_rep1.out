Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions "suspicious findings", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumors. Therefore, the malignancy is classified as "NA".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or score in the statement, so it is also classified as "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a clinical narrative that does not provide sufficient information to determine the sample type, malignancy, or Gleason grade, so all fields are set to "NA".
