Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions "suspicious findings", but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumors. The findings are described as uncertain and requiring further investigation, so it is classified as "NA" for malignancy.
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any specific tumor characteristics, so it is also classified as "NA" for Gleason grade.
