Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. 

Since the statement mentions that the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy, the original sample type is "RP". 

The statement describes an "original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate", which indicates that there were malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".

The statement reports various Gleason grades, but the most severe lesion is Gleason 4+4. 

Here is the structured data in valid JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
