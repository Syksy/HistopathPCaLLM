Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, which suggests that there might not be any malignancy, but it's not explicitly stated, so it is classified as "NA".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or score, so it is classified as "NA".

Overall, the statement appears to be a summary of the examination results, but it lacks specific information about the histopathological findings, so most fields are classified as "NA".
