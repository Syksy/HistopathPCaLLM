Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not mention the specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and the statement mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles examined were clear, which suggests that there might not be any malignancy, but it's not explicitly stated, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or score, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
