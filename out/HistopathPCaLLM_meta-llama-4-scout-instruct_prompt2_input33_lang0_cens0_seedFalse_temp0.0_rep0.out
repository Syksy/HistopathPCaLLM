Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Radical prostatectomy preparate", which indicates that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Tumor has penetrated the capsule" and "One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes", which clearly indicates that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "Gleason types 3+4/4+3", which indicates that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7 (or 4+3=7, but we only need to report one, and 3+4 is the more common way to express this). 

Note that I have only considered the most severe lesion and provided the structured result in a flat JSON format with no nested structures.
