Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention the specific sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles" and only mentions "possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes", but not in the context of a prostate cancer diagnosis, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
