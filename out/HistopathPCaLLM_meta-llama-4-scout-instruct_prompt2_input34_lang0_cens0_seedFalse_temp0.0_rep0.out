Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "The presented sample is a resection", which implies that the sample type is a "Resection of the Prostate" or simply "RP". 
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma" and "no malignities", which clearly indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that there is no prostatic adenocarcinoma and no malignancies, the Gleason grade, which is a system of grading prostate cancer tissue based on how it looks under a microscope, is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".
