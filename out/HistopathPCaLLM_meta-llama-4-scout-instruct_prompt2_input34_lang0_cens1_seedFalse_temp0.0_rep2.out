Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I classify it as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Findings do not indicate prostatic [malignancy]" and describes the tissue as "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." This indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I classify it as "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates that the findings are benign (hyperplastic prostate tissue) and do not suggest a malignant condition, the Gleason grade, which is used for prostate cancer grading, is not applicable. Therefore, I classify it as "NA".
