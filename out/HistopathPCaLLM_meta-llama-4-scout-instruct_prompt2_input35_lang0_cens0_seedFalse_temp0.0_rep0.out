Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies" which directly corresponds to the value "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of carcinoma" which implies there are no malignant tumor findings, hence the value "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates no carcinoma and only mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia" without any reference to a Gleason grade, the appropriate value is "NA".
