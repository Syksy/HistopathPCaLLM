Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I set it to "NA" as it's not clearly specified.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" which is a precursor to cancer but not cancer itself, and "hyperplasia" which is a benign condition. There's no clear indication of malignant tumor findings. Hence, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: There's no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
