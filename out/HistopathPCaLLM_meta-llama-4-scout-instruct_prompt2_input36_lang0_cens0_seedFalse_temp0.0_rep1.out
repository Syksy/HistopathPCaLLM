Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is categorized as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity," which directly translates to there being no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: The statement does not mention any Gleason grading, which implies that it is not applicable or not found. Since the statement confirms there's no malignancy, and no Gleason score is provided, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
