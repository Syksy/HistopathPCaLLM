Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is classified as "NA" due to the lack of specific information.

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of malignity," which directly translates to there being no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: The statement does not mention any Gleason grade or score, which is typically reported for malignant tumors. Since there's no information on the Gleason grade and the statement rules out malignancy, it is classified as "NA".
