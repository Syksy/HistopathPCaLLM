Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not mention the sample type explicitly, and it does not provide enough information to infer it. Therefore, I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that microscopically, there was epithelial hyperplasia, but it does not indicate any malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of Gleason grade or any malignant tumor findings, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
