Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate" and "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure.
2. The statement indicates "Findings indicate hyperplasia", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any malignant tumor characteristics, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
