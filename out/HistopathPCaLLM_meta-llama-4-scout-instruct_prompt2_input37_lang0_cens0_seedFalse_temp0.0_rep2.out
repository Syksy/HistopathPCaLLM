Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate" which implies a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) sample.
2. The histological examination reveals "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation in typical places" but does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, suggesting a benign condition.
3. The findings indicate "hyperplasia", which is a benign condition, and there is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically used for malignant tumors. Therefore, the Gleason grade is reported as "NA".
