Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention the sample type explicitly, and it is not possible to infer it with certainty. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components and minor inflammation, but there is no indication of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any information that would suggest a malignant tumor. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
