Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "needle biopsies as samples", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No suspected malignity", which implies that there were no findings of malignant tumor. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: The statement does not mention any Gleason grade or score, which implies that the Gleason grade is not applicable or not reported for this sample. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
