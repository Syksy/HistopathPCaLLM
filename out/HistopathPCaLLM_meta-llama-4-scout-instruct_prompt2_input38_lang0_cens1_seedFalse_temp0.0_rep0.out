Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not mention the sample type explicitly, so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions "hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation" but does not indicate any malignant tumor findings, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, which is typically reported for malignant tumors, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
