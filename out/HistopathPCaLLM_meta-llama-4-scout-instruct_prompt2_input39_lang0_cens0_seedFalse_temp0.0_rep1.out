Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostatectomy preparate", which implies a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) sample. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions a "tumor" and Gleason grades, indicating malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement reports Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages, resulting in a Gleason grade of 7. Therefore, the answer is "3+4=7".
