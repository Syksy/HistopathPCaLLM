Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention the specific sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that it is not clear whether there are benign hyperplasia or malignant findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement also mentions that the Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
