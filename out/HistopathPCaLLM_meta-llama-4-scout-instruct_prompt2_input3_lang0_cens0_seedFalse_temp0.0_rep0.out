Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and the process seems to be related to a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), so I inferred the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no indications of malignancy, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
