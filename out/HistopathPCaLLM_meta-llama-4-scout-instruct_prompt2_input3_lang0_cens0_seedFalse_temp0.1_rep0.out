Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and the process seems to be related to a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), which involves chipping away prostate tissue. Therefore, the sample type is most likely "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." This clearly indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is structured as "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that "Nothing indicating malignancy is found," and there's no mention of Gleason grading (which is used for prostate cancer), the Gleason grade is not applicable, so it's structured as "NA".
