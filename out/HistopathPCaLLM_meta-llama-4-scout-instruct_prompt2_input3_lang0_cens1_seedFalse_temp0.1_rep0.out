Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention a specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), and the description of the sample is not conclusive, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that "nothing conclusive may be derived from this run", implying that no malignant tumor findings can be confirmed, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any other specific histopathological features, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
