Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be a shaving material, which is typically associated with a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure. Therefore, I assigned "TURP" to the "Sampletype" field.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth", which suggests that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I assigned "no" to the "Malignancy" field.
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I assigned "NA" to the "Gleason" field.
