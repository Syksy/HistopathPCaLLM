Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement mentions that histological examination reveals "at least hyperplastic prostate" and "at least inflammation, but possibly something else", but there is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is classified as "no".
* There is no mention of Gleason grade or any information that would suggest a malignant tumor, so "Gleason" is classified as "NA".
