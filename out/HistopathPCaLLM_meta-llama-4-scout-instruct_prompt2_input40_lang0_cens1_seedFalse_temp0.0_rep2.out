Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it's classified as "NA".
2. The statement mentions "at least inflammation, but possibly something else" and "Further examination is needed", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were confirmed, so it's classified as "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade, so it's classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements!
