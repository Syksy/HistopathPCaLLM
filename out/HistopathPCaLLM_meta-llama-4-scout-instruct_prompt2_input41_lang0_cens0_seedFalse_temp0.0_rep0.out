Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies" which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This clearly indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes there are "No signs of prostate cancer in the material," it implies that there are no Gleason grades reported for a malignant tumor. Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
