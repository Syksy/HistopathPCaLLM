Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sample Type**: The statement mentions "representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." Therefore, the original sample type is "biopsy."

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no."

3. **Gleason Grade**: Since the statement indicates no signs of prostate cancer, there's no Gleason grade reported. For benign or non-malignant statements, the preferred value is "NA."
