Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate", which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. The statement concludes that "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not", which suggests that no malignant tumor findings were identified, or at least, it's not possible to confirm the presence of cancer. Therefore, I would classify this as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. Since there is no mention of a Gleason grade or any cancer-related changes, I would set the Gleason field to "NA".
