Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Prostatectomy preparate", which implies that the sample type is a Radical Prostatectomy (RP) specimen. Therefore, the sample type is "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "Gleason grade 4 differentiation" and a "score 7 (4+3)", which indicates the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the malignancy is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason grades as "4+3" with a sum of "7". Therefore, the reported Gleason grade is "4+3=7".
