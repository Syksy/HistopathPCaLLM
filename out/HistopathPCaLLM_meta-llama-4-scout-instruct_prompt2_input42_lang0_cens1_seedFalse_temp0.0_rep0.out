Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to structure the data into the required JSON format. Here's my interpretation:

The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type, but it refers to a "Prostate sample", which implies a type of prostate-related sample. However, the exact type (biopsy, RP, TURP) is not specified, so I will default to "NA".

The statement mentions "Mixed findings" but explicitly states that "whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined", which implies that there are no clear malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "NA".

There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any information that would suggest a malignant tumor, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".

Here is the structured data in JSON format:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
