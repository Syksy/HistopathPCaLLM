Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate chippings as samples" and "Material run in cassettes A-H", which is indicative of a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "TURP".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material". This directly implies that there were no malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is classified as "no".

3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes there are "no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma", it naturally follows that there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, "Gleason" is classified as "NA".
