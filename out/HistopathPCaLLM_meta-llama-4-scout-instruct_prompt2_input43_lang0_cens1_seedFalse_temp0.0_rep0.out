Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so I will default to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached", implying that there are no clear malignant tumor findings, so I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
