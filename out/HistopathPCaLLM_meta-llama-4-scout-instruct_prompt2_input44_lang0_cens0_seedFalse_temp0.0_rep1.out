Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate biopsies", which directly indicates that the sample type is a "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement concludes with "but now no tumor tissue can be seen", which clearly indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, resulting in a "no" for malignancy.
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates no tumor tissue is present and the biopsy is benign, there's no Gleason grade reported, leading to a value of "NA".
