Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not specify the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes", which implies that no malignant tumor findings were detected in this particular sample. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
