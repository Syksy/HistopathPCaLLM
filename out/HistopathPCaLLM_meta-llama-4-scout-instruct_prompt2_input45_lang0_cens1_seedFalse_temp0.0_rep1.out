Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions a "prostate sample", but it doesn't specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I set it to "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes a "suspect" sample, but ultimately concludes that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and that "No metastases seen in lymph nodes in the area". This suggests that there are no clear malignant tumor findings, so I set it to "no".
3. **Gleason**: There is no mention of Gleason grading or scores in the statement, so I set it to "NA".

Please let me know if this is correct or if I need to revise anything!
