Based on the provided statement, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and structure it in JSON format. Here is the result:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions a "prostate sample", but it does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I will classify it as "NA" (not available).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not mention any clear evidence of malignancy, and in fact, it states that "the structure is unclear and not able to detect" and that "Further inspection is needed". This suggests that the sample is likely benign, so I will classify it as "no" (no malignant tumor findings).
3. **Gleason**: Since the sample appears to be benign, there is no Gleason grade reported, so I will classify it as "NA".
