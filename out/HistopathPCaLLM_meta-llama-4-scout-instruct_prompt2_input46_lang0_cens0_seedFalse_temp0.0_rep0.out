Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "Shaved prostate chippings" which is a description commonly associated with a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, the sample type is classified as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." This clearly indicates that there were no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that there are no signs of prostate cancer, the Gleason grade, which is used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer, is not applicable. Therefore, the answer is "NA".
