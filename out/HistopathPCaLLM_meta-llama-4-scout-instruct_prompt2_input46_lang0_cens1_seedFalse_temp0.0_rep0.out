Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is classified as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the findings might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia, but it explicitly states that it is not able to assess whether there are cancer-related changes or not. Since there is no clear indication of malignancy and it is not possible to rule out benign changes, it is classified as "no" malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grading, so it is classified as "NA". 

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more statements!
