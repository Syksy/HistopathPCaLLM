Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, it is classified as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the findings might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia, but it explicitly states that it is not able to assess whether there are cancer-related changes or not. Since there's no clear indication of malignancy and it cannot be confirmed, it is reasonable to conclude that there are no malignant tumor findings, hence "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about Gleason grades or scores, so it is classified as "NA".
