Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "biopsies from the right and three from the left," which clearly indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy".

2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "No malign findings on the left or the right." This directly translates to there being no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no".

3. **Gleason**: The statement does not mention any Gleason grade or score, which implies that there were no malignant findings that would require a Gleason grading. For benign or non-malignant statements, the preferred value is "NA". Therefore, the value for "Gleason" is "NA".
