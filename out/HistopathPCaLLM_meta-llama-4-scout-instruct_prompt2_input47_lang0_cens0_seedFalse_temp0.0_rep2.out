Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I determined the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "biopsies from the right and three from the left", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malign findings on the left or the right", which means there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, the value is set to "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
