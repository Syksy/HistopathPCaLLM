Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP). Therefore, I assign "NA" as the sample type is not clearly identified.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions that it is "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." This implies that no malignant tumor findings were identified or confirmed. Hence, I assign "no" to indicate that there were no confirmed malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings and no Gleason grade mentioned, I assign "NA" for the Gleason grade.
