Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate resection", which corresponds to the sample type "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "adenocarcinoma" and describes tumor characteristics, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement provides detailed information about the Gleason grades: in the first focus, the most common grade is 4 and the next common is 3, while in the second focus, Gleason 5 (>80%) is present with a small portion of Gleason 4. The summary states a Gleason 9 tumor, which can be inferred as 4+5=9. Therefore, the structured answer is "4+5=9".
