Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention a specific sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it appears to be a educational demonstration sample, so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* There is no mention of malignant tumor findings, and the statement explicitly mentions that the sample is not used to derive differentiation scores, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that Gleason scores (1-5) are not derived from this sample, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
