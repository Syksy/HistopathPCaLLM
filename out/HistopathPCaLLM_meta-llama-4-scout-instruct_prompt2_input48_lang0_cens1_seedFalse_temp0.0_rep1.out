Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not specify a clear sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), and it mentions that the sample material was obtained from multiple autopsies, so I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
* The statement does not report any malignant tumor findings, and it explicitly states that the sample is for educational purposes and not for deriving differentiation scores, so I set "Malignancy" to "NA".
* The statement explicitly mentions that Gleason scores (1-5) will not be derived, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
