Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this output:

1. The statement mentions "prostate chippings" and "shavings", which suggests that the sample type is likely from a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I assigned "TURP" to the "Sampletype" field.
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "5 shavings contained carcinoma", which indicates that there are malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I assigned "yes" to the "Malignancy" field.
3. The statement reports that the "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4". This information allows us to infer that the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. Therefore, I assigned "3+4=7" to the "Gleason" field.
