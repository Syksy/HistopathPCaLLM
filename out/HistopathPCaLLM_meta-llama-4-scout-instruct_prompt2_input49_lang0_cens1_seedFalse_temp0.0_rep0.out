Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

The reasoning behind this is:

* The statement does not explicitly mention the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is classified as "NA".
* The statement does not provide any clear indication of malignant tumor findings, and it explicitly mentions that further assessment is not possible due to technical limitations. Therefore, it is classified as "NA" for malignancy.
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score, so it is also classified as "NA".
