Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's how I arrived at this structured data:

1. The original sample type is mentioned as "prostate biopsies", which corresponds to "biopsy".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes", indicating that there are no malignant tumor findings, which corresponds to "no" for malignancy.
3. Since there are no malignant findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, which corresponds to "NA".
