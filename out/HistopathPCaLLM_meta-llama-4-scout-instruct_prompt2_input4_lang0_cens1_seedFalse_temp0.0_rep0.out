Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and "sampling sites", which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated, but there are no indications of other sample types (RP, TURP), I will assume it's a biopsy.
2. The statement explicitly states that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material is insufficient to assess for presence of adenocarcinoma, which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
