Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not specify the sample type (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so I set "Sampletype" to "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and the sample material is insufficient to assess for adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
