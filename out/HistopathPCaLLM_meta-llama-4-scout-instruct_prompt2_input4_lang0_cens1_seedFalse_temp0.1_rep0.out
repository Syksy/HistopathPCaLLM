Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "prostate tissue" and "sampling sites", which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated, but there are no indications of other sample types (RP, TURP), I assume it's a biopsy.
2. The statement explicitly states that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material is insufficient to assess for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. This implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
