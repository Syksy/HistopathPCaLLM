Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "sampling sites" and "sample part", which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. The statement explicitly states that "no notable atypic patterns are present" and that the sample material is "insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes", which implies that there are no malignant tumor findings, so I set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no Gleason grade reported, so I set "Gleason" to "NA".
