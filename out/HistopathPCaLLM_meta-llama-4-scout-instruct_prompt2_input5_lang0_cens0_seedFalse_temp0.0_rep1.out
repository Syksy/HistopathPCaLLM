Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and provides details about the Gleason grades, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "growth pattern 4+3" for macro A, which is the most severe lesion. Although it mentions another Gleason grade (4+5) for macro B, the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion, and 4+5=9 is indeed more severe, but the question also prefers the format "major+minor=sum" in whole numbers and 4+3 is present. However, as 4+5 is more severe and sums to 9,  I should report  "4+5=9". Here is the correction.

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
