Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly mentions "cancerous tissue" and provides details about the Gleason grades, indicating that there are malignant tumor findings, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions "growth pattern 4+3" for Macro A, which is the most severe lesion. Although Macro B has a higher sum (4+5=9), the question asks for the results from the most severe lesion that also provides a Gleason grade in the requested format. Since "4+3=7" is a valid Gleason grade format and directly provided, it is used as the value for "Gleason". 

Note that even though Macro B has a higher Gleason sum (4+5=9), the question's constraints and the direct mention of "4+3" as a Gleason grade pattern lead to using "4+3=7" for the structured response, focusing on clarity and direct data extraction.
