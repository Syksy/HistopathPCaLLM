Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings" which implies that no malignant tumor findings were detected, so the answer is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" which implies that the Gleason grade could not be determined, so the answer is "NA".
