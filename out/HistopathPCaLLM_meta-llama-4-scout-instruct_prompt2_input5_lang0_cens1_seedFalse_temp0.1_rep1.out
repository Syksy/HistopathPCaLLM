Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions that "Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed" which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Therefore, I will set "Sampletype" to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings" which implies that no malignant tumor findings were observed. Therefore, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred" which implies that the Gleason grade could not be determined. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
