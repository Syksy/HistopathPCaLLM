Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "shaving chips" which is a common sample type for TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedures. Therefore, I inferred the sample type as "TURP".
2. The statement mentions that the findings "hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia" and there is no mention of any malignant tumor findings. Therefore, I concluded that there are no malignant tumor findings, and set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there are no malignant tumor findings, there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, I set "Gleason" to "NA".
