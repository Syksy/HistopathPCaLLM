Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "parts of the original prostatic operation material", which suggests that the sample type is from a surgical operation, making "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) the most likely sample type.
2. The statement mentions that the results are "inconclusive" due to technical challenges, and that "majority of the sample material cannot be further inspected". This implies that no conclusive diagnosis can be made, making "Malignancy" and "Gleason" grade not assessable, hence "NA" for both.
