Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. Although the statement mentions a suspicious finding with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, it is mentioned that "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet". This implies that there is no conclusive evidence of malignancy, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade in the statement, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
