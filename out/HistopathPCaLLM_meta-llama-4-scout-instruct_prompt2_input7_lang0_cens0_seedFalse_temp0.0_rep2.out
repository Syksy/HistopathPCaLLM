Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "routinely collected prostate biopsies", which indicates that the sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, the value is set to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement mentions that the finding is "on the suspicion-level" and "clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet", it also mentions that the morphological changes suggest adenocarcinoma. This implies that there are malignant tumor findings, albeit not conclusive. Therefore, the value is set to "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement does not provide any information about the Gleason grade or score. Therefore, the value is set to "NA".
