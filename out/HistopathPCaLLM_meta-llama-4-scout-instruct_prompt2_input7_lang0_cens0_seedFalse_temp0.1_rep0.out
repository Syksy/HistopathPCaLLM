Based on the provided statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions "prostate biopsies", which indicates that the original sample type is a biopsy. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement describes a focus with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma, which implies that there are malignant tumor findings. However, it's mentioned that the finding is at the suspicion-level and not conclusive. Despite this, I will set "Malignancy" to "yes" as it suggests a potential malignant finding.
3. The statement does not provide a Gleason grade or score. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA". 

Please let me know if this is correct or if I should revise anything! 

Raw data used: 

Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures. /John Doe, Meilahti, 11.11.2011
