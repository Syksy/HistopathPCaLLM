Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that a prostate sample was collected, which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated as "RP", "TURP", or another type, and "biopsy" is a common sample type for prostate cancer diagnosis, I'll assume it's a biopsy.
2. The statement mentions that one sample exhibited "a point of interest, with some atypical structures and morphological changes", but ultimately concludes that "no definite conclusions could be drawn" due to the small size of the finding and the rest of the material being typical. This suggests that there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, so I'll classify it as "no" for malignancy.
3. Since there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I'll set it to "NA".
