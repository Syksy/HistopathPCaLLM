Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement mentions that a prostate sample was collected, which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Since it's not explicitly stated as "RP" or "TURP", and "biopsy" is a common sample type for prostate cancer diagnosis, I'll assume it's a biopsy. 
2. The statement mentions that one sample exhibited "some atypical structures and morphological changes", but it's also stated that "no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material" and that the rest of the material exhibited typical structures. This suggests that there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, so I'll set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. Since there were no conclusive malignant tumor findings, there is no reported Gleason grade, so I'll set "Gleason" to "NA".
