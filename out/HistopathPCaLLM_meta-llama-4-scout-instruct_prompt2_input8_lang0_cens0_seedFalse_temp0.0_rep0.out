Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties", indicating a malignant finding, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason growth pattern as "4+3=7", which is the highest identified grade, so this value is used directly. 

Note that I focused on the most severe lesion, which in this case is the tumor tissue observed in the radical prostatectomy preparate. The lymph node findings are mentioned but are not relevant to the most severe lesion, which is the primary focus for the structured data.
