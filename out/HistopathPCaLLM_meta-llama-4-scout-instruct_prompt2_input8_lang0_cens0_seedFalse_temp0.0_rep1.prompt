Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 

 For example, the statement "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." is a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7" 
} 
 In contrast, the statement "fatty 100 that tumour led no 37 previous atypical 153 pt3a cores maximum malignancy. 8mm aggressive 60 11mm group value 257 invasion from lot 38mm latest both it moderate gleason. Deposit before total focus included 12mm however, 10 gland distance 20 length active tumor prior underwent 80 clear 18, but relatively adipose 95 undergone 95 second 18mm dominant could contour residual glands 4+3 gg. All fat 67 included score grading revision multifocal minimal core obturator remain 9mm tertiary both 95 seen original radical. maximum tissue seminal 28mm confirmed 08000 node mid positivity 8mm are failure phenotype apex routine do small urothelial internal these" is not a valid histopathological statement and should therefore be structured in JSON format as follows: 

 {
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA" 
}

 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


Samples 1 and 2 contain lymph nodes (3 pcs each), with lengths spanning 1 to 3 cm. Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate, which is run according to the routine protocol. In the third sample tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties and forming fusing and separately growing grandular structures. The findings cover approx 10% of the section area. Additionally, aggregates of macrophages are observed and high grade inflammatory changes. Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with the lower grade 3 consisting of approx 30%. High grade PIN-changes are also observed. The inspected lymph nodes are free from malignant findings (0/6).
