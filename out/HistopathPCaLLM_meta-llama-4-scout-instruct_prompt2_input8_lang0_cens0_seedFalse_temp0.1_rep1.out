Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "radical prostatectomy preparate", which corresponds to the value "RP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement describes "tumor tissue" with "invasive properties", indicating a malignant finding, so the value is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions the Gleason growth pattern as "4+3=7", which is the highest identified grade, so this value is used directly.

Note that I ignored the information about the lymph nodes, as the question focuses on the prostate cancer histopathological findings. Also, I did not consider the PIN changes or inflammatory changes as they are not directly relevant to the requested structured fields.
