Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue of interest" and "samples with indices 1 and 2", which implies that the sample type is likely a biopsy. Therefore, I will set "Sampletype" to "biopsy".
2. **Malignancy**: Although the statement mentions "potentially interesting properties" and "suspicion of PIN-changes", it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Additionally, it states that samples 1 and 2 were "completely free of malignant findings". Since there's no clear evidence of malignancy, I will set "Malignancy" to "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the "highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing" and that there are "empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart". This implies that no Gleason grade was reported or recorded. Therefore, I will set "Gleason" to "NA".
