Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type is likely a biopsy, as the statement mentions "Samples with indices 1 and 2 contain non-primary tissue (multiple segments each)" and "Examination across the third sample reveals some potentially interesting properties". This suggests that the sample is a biopsy sample. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "biopsy".
2. The statement mentions that "The samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings" and there is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings in the third sample. Although there is a mention of "Suspicion of PIN-changes", it is not a definitive malignant finding. Therefore, "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap". This indicates that no Gleason grade was reported or recorded. Therefore, "Gleason" is set to "NA".
