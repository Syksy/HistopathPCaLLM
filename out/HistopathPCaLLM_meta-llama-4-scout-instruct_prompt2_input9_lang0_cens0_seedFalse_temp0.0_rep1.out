Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which is a method commonly associated with Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Therefore, I classified the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed", which directly translates to "Malignancy" being "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement concludes that the findings fit "benign hyperplasia" and there are "no malignant findings", there is no Gleason grade reported, resulting in a value of "NA" for this field.
