Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into valid JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The original sample type appears to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate), as indicated by the mention of "electrosection shavings" which is a method commonly used in TURP procedures.
2. The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings are observed", which indicates that there are no malignant tumor findings, so the answer is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the answer is "NA".
