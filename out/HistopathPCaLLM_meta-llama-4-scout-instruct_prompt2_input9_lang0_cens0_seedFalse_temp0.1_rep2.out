Based on the provided histopathological statement, I will structure the data into the required JSON format as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this structured data:

1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions "electrosection shavings" which is a common method for obtaining tissue samples during a Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) procedure. Therefore, I inferred the sample type as "TURP".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement explicitly states "No malignant findings are observed", which directly translates to a "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: Since the statement indicates no malignant findings and mentions "benign hyperplasia", there is no Gleason grade reported. Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".
