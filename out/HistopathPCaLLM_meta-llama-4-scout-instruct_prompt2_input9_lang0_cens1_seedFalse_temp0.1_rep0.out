Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Here's my reasoning:

1. The statement does not mention a specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), and the material appears to be prostate tissue, but it's not clear what type of sample it is. Therefore, "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
2. The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears "rather normal" and that "conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" due to suspected faulty processing of the sample material. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
3. There is no mention of a Gleason grade or any indication of malignancy, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
