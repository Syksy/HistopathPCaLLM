Based on the provided statement, I would structure the data as follows:

```
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Reasoning:

* The statement does not mention a specific sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
* The statement mentions that the epithelial cell lining appears "rather normal" and that conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn due to suspected faulty processing of the sample material. There is no indication of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "no".
* There is no mention of a Gleason grade or score, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
