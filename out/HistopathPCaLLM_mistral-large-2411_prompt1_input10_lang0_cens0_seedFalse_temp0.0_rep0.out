Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly mentioned as "biopsy."
2. The statement indicates a suspicion-level finding but leans towards benign, so "Malignancy" is "no."
3. Since there is no definitive diagnosis of carcinoma, the Gleason grade is "NA."
