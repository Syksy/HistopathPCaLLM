Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as indicated by the term "chippings" which refers to tissue removed during a TURP procedure.
2. Malignant tumor findings are present ("adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material").
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "4+4=8" since Gleason 4 is the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8.
