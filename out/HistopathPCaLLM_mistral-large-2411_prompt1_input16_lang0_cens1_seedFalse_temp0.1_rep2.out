Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is "NA".
2. The statement mentions "various grades of cell differentiation" and discusses the difficulty in assigning explicit scores, indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings, so it is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is not explicitly provided due to resolution issues in the digitalized images, so it is "NA".
