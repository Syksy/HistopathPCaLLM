Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is set to "NA".
- There is no definitive mention of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is set to "NA".
- The Gleason grade is mentioned as a range (3 to 5) but not specified for a particular lesion, so "Gleason" is set to "NA".
