Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because the statement mentions "standard shaving procedure."
2. There were malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is "yes."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "Gleason sum 7," with the larger fraction being stage 3 (which corresponds to Gleason grade 3). Since the larger fraction is 60%, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7."
