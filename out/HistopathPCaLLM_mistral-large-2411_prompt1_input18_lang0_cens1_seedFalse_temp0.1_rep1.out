Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is "NA".
2. The statement mentions that a small fraction requires further inspection but does not confirm malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
