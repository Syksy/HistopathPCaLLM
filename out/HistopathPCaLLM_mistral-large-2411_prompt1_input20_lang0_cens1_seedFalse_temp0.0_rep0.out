Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is "NA".
- The statement does not confirm the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings due to the affected tissue samples, so it is "NA".
- The Gleason grade is also "NA" because the examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region.
