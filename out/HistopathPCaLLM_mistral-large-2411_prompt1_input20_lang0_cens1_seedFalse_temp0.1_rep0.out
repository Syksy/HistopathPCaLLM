Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text does not clearly indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The statement does not confirm the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings due to the affected tissue samples. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The Gleason grade is not definitively reported due to the affected tissue samples. Therefore, "NA" is used.
