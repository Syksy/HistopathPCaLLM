Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text does not clearly indicate whether the sample is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The text states that the examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there were malignant tumor findings, so "NA" is used.
- Since the examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible, there is no reported Gleason grade. Therefore, "NA" is used.
