Explanation:
- The term "chippings" and the mention of "shavings" suggest that the sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate).
- The description of "poorly differentiated growth" and "tumor-like tissue" indicates malignant findings.
- The Gleason grading is reported as 5 (most common) and 4 (second most common), resulting in a sum of 5+4=9.
