Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the type of sample (e.g., biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is "NA".
- The statement does not clearly indicate the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
- Since there is no clear indication of a Gleason grade, "Gleason" is "NA".
