Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated, so it is marked as "NA".
- The statement does not confirm the presence or absence of malignant tumor findings, hence "NA".
- The Gleason grade is not determined due to the difficulty in assessing the samples, so it is marked as "NA".
