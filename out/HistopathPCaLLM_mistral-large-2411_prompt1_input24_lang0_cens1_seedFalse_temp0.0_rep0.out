Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",

}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions multiple types of samples (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings), but does not specify which type the most severe lesion came from. Therefore, "NA" is used.
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, indicating malignant findings.
3. **Gleason**: The most severe lesion mentioned is Gleason 3+4, which sums to 7.
