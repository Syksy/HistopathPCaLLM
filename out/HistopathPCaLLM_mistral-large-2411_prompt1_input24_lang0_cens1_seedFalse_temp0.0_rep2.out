```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions multiple types of samples (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, shavings), so the specific sample type for the most severe lesion is not clear. Therefore, "NA" is used.
