Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, so it is "NA".
- The malignancy findings are not clearly stated due to the difficulty in assessment caused by recent radiation therapy, so it is "NA".
- The Gleason grade is also "NA" because the statement mentions a possible 'Gleason sum 7' but does not confirm it or provide specific grades.
