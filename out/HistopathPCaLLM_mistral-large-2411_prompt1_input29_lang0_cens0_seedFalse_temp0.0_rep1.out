Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is "NA".
2. Malignant tumor findings are present, so "Malignancy" is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as mostly grade 4 with a smaller portion also grade 4, resulting in a sum of 7, so "Gleason" is "4+4=7".
