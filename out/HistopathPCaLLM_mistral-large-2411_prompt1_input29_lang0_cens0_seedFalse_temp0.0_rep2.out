Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is marked as "NA".
2. Malignant tumor findings are present, as indicated by the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4," which sums to 7.
