Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and the description does not clearly fit into these categories, so "NA" is used.
2. There are no malignant tumor findings mentioned in the statement, so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
