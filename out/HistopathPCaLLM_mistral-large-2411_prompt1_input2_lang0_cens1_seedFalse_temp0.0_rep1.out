Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is marked as "NA".
- There is no clear indication of malignant tumor findings, hence "NA".
- Since there is no mention of a Gleason grade, it is marked as "NA".
