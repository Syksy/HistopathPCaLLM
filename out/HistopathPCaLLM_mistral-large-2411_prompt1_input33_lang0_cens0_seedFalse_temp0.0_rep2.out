Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
- There are malignant tumor findings ("yes").
- The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4/4+3". Since we need to return the most severe lesion, we choose "4+3=7".
