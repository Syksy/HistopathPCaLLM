Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is "NA".
- The statement mentions "possibly something else" but does not confirm malignancy, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
- Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the "Gleason" grade is "NA".
