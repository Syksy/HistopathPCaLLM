Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is not clear whether it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The statement does not provide a clear indication of malignant tumor findings due to the inconclusive results. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- Since there is no clear indication of malignancy, the Gleason grade is also "NA".
