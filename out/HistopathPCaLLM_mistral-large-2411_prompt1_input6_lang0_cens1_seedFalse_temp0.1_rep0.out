Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the statement refers to "prostatic operation material," which does not clearly fall into "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The statement does not provide conclusive information about malignant tumor findings due to the heavy burn artefact, so "NA" is used.
- Since the results are inconclusive and there is no mention of a Gleason grade, "NA" is used for the Gleason field.
