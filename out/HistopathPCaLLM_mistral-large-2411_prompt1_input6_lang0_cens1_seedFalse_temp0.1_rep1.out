Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated, and the material is described as "prostatic operation material," which does not clearly fall into the categories of "biopsy," "RP," or "TURP." Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The statement does not provide conclusive information about malignant tumor findings due to the heavy burn artefact and the inconclusive results. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- Since there is no conclusive information about malignancy, the Gleason grade is also "NA."
