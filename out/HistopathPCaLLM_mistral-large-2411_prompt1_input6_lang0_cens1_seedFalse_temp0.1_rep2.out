Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and it is unclear whether it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- The statement does not provide conclusive information about malignant tumor findings due to the heavy burn artefact and inconclusive results. Therefore, "NA" is used.
- Since there is no conclusive information about malignancy, the Gleason grade is also "NA".
