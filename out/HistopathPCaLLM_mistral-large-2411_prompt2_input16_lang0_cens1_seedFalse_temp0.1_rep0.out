Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "suspicious foci" and "various grades of cell differentiation," indicating the presence of malignant findings, so it is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues, so it is "NA".
