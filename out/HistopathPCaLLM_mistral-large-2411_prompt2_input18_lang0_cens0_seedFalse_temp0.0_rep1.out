Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" because the statement mentions "standard shaving procedure," which typically refers to Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP).
2. There are malignant tumor findings as the statement mentions "a small fraction appears to be carcinoma."
3. The Gleason grade is reported as "3+4=7" because the statement mentions "Gleason sum 7, with the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." This implies a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
