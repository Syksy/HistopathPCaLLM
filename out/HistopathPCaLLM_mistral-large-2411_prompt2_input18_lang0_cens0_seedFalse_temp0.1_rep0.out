Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) as the statement mentions "standard shaving procedure" which is typically associated with TURP.
2. There were malignant tumor findings as indicated by the presence of carcinoma.
3. The Gleason grade is reported as a sum of 7, with the larger fraction being stage 3 (which corresponds to Gleason pattern 3). Therefore, the Gleason grade is "3+4=7".
