Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that >95% of the material appears benign, and the small fraction that warrants further investigation is too small to properly assign a grade group. Therefore, there are no confirmed malignant tumor findings, so it is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there are no confirmed malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
