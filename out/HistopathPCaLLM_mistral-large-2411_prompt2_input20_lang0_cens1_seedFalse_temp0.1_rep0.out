Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP).
- The statement mentions that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given, so it is not clear whether there are malignant tumor findings.
- The statement mentions a hypothetical Gleason score (3+4), but since the examination is impossible, the Gleason grade is not reported.
