Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP).
- The statement indicates that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies, so the malignancy status is "NA".
- Since the Gleason grade cannot be assigned due to the fragmented and varying samples, the Gleason grade is "NA".
