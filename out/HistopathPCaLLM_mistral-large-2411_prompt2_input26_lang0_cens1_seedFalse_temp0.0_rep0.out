Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the statement does not clearly indicate whether the material is from a biopsy, RP, or TURP.
- The statement mentions a possible "Gleason sum 7," but it is unclear if this was verified, and the histopathology cannot be reasonably used due to recent radiation therapy. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine the presence of a malignant tumor or the Gleason grade.
