Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", so it is marked as "NA".
- The statement does not clearly confirm malignant tumor findings due to the uncertainty caused by recent radiation therapy, so it is marked as "NA".
- The Gleason grade is mentioned as a possible 'Gleason sum 7', but it is not verified or clear, so it is marked as "NA".
