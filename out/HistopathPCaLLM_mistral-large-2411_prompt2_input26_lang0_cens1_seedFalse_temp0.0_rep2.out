Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly mentioned, and the text does not clearly indicate whether it is a biopsy, RP, or TURP.
- The statement mentions possible malignancy but does not confirm it due to the recent radiation therapy, making it unclear whether there are definitive malignant tumor findings.
- The Gleason grade is mentioned as a possible "Gleason sum 7," but it is unclear if this was verified, and the specific Gleason grades (major+minor) are not provided.
