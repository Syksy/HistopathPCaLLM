Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma," so it is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grade as mostly grade 4 with a smaller portion also grade 4, resulting in a sum of 4+4=8.
