Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not explicitly mention the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions "invasive adenocarcinoma," indicating malignant tumor findings, so it is marked as "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The statement describes the Gleason grade as "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." This translates to a Gleason score of "4+4=8".
