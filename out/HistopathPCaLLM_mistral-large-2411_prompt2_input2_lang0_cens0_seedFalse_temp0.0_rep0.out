Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions an "autopsy sample intended for research use," which does not fit into the allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP"). Therefore, the value is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement clearly indicates benign growth and no tumor growth, so the value is "no".
3. **Gleason**: Since there is no malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is "NA".
