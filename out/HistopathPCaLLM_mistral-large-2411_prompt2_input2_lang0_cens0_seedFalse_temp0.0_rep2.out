Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not clearly specified as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and the statement mentions it is an autopsy sample intended for research use, which is not one of the allowed values. Therefore, "Sampletype" is "NA".
2. The statement explicitly mentions "normal benign growth" and no tumor growth, so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the "Gleason" grade is "NA".
