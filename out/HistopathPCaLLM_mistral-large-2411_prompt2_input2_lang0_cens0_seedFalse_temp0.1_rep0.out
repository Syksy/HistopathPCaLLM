Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". The term "prostatectomy specimen" suggests it might be an RP (radical prostatectomy), but since it's an autopsy sample intended for research use, it's best to mark it as "NA".
2. There were no malignant tumor findings; the tissue is described as having normal benign growth.
3. Since there is no malignant tumor, the Gleason grade is "NA".
