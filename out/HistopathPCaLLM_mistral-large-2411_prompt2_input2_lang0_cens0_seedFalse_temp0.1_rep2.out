Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP". The term "prostatectomy specimen" suggests it might be a radical prostatectomy (RP), but since it's an autopsy sample intended for research use, it doesn't fit the typical categories. Hence, "NA" is used.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings as the tissue shows benign growth and normal aging changes.
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
