Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",

}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not explicitly stated as "biopsy", "RP", or "TURP", and the statement mentions an autopsy specimen, which is not one of the allowed values.
- The statement does not confirm malignant tumor findings; it only suggests potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes but requires further inspection.
- There is no reported Gleason grade in the statement.
