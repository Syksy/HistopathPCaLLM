Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is "NA".
- The statement explicitly mentions "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles," so "Malignancy" is "no".
- Since there are no malignant findings, the "Gleason" grade is "NA".
