{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The term "electrosection chippings" indicates a TURP (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) procedure.
- The findings indicate hyperplasia, which is benign, so there are no malignant tumor findings.
- Since the findings are benign, the Gleason grade is not applicable (NA).
