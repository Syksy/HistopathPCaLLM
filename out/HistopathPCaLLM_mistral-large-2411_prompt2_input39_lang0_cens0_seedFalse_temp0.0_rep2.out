Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The statement mentions a "prostatectomy preparate," which indicates the sample type is "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy).
2. The statement describes a tumor with Gleason grades, indicating malignant findings, so "Malignancy" is "yes".
3. The Gleason grade is reported as 3 (major) and 4 (minor), resulting in a sum of 7, so "Gleason" is "3+4=7".
