Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) because the statement mentions "shaving material," which is typically associated with TURP procedures.
- There were no malignant tumor findings, as the statement explicitly mentions "No atypical or invasive epithelial growth" and concludes with "Benign prostate hyperplasia."
- The Gleason grade is "NA" because the findings are benign.
