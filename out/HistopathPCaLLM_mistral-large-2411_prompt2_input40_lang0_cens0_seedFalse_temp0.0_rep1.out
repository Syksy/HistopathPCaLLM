Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is determined to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "shaving material," which is typical in TURP procedures.
2. There were no malignant tumor findings, as the summary states "Benign prostate hyperplasia."
3. The Gleason grade is "NA" because the statement describes a benign condition.
