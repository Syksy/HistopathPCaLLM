Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is explicitly mentioned as "biopsies," so the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy."
2. The statement clearly mentions "no tumor tissue can be seen," indicating no malignant tumor findings, so the value for "Malignancy" is "no."
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the value for "Gleason" is "NA."
