Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is explicitly mentioned as "biopsies."
2. The statement clearly indicates that the samples do not contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes, hence "Malignancy" is "no."
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA."
