Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP).
- There is no mention of malignant tumor findings; instead, it states that the sample material is insufficient to assess the presence of adenocarcinoma.
- Since there is no mention of a Gleason grade, the Gleason field is set to "NA".
