Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not clearly specify the sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP).
- The statement mentions that the results are inconclusive due to technical challenges, so it is not possible to determine if there were malignant tumor findings.
- Since the results are inconclusive, there is no reported Gleason grade.
