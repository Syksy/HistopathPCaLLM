Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly mentioned as "prostate biopsies," so the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy."
2. The statement mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not confirm it, and the rest of the samples are benign. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no."
3. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the value for "Gleason" is "NA."
