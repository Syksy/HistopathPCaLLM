Based on the provided histopathological statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly mentioned as "prostate biopsies," so the value for "Sampletype" is "biopsy."
2. The statement mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not confirm a malignant tumor finding. Therefore, the value for "Malignancy" is "no."
3. Since there is no confirmed malignant finding, the Gleason grade is not applicable, so the value for "Gleason" is "NA."
