Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is clearly mentioned as "prostate biopsies," so the value is "biopsy."
2. The statement mentions a suspicion of adenocarcinoma but does not confirm it, so the value is "no" for malignant tumor findings.
3. Since there is no confirmed malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA."
