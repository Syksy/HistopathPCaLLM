Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "the samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings," indicating no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the Gleason patterns are missing and no grade score is reported, so it is marked as "NA".
