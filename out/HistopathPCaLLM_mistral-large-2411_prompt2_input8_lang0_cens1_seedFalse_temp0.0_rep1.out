Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the samples in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings. Although there is a discussion about PIN-changes, there is no clear indication of a malignant tumor, so it is marked as "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that the Gleason patterns are missing, with empty fields indicating major and minor grades. Therefore, it is marked as "NA".
