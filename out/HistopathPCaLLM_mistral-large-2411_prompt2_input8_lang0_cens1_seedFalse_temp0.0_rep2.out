Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not clearly specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so the value is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that "the samples run in index 1 and index 2 were confirmed to be completely free of malignant findings," indicating no malignant tumor findings.
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions that "Highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing, with empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor in the chart; apparently the lower grade was covering above 10% of the sample but no grade score is reported, possibly a recording mishap." Therefore, the Gleason grade is "NA".
