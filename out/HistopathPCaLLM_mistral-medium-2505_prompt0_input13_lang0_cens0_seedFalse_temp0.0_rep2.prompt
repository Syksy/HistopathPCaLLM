Your task is to produce structured data from free format text. Raw data will be provided in the end of these instructions. These statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. You should act as a data structuring algorithm. Return the structured answers in valid JSON format. Note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 
 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 
 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 
 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). 
 Apply the above questions to the following statement: 


The samples consist of prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations, totalling approx 60mm on the right and approx 80mm on the left. In sample B carcinoma is observed, reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5). This higher grade differentiation consists of approx 20% on the left. In rest of the samples normal grandular structures are observed, without any significant inflammation either.
