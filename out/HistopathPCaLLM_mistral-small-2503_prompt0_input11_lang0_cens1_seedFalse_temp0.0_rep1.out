Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement mentions that the evaluation of high-grade PIN (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) remains inconclusive, and no malignant findings are explicitly reported, so it is "no".
3. **reported_gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
