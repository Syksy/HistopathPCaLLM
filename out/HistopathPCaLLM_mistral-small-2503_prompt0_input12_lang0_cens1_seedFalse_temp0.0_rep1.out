Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions "suspected prostate cancer tissue," but it does not confirm the presence of malignant findings, so it is "NA".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there is no confirmation of malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
