Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern," but it also states that "there are no out of the ordinary inflammation either" and that further verification is needed. Since there is no clear indication of malignant findings, it is marked as "no".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
