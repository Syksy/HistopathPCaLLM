Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the original sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions the possibility of assessing differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5, but it does not confirm the presence of malignant findings, so it is marked as "NA".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since the statement does not provide a specific Gleason grade and mentions a range, it is marked as "NA".
