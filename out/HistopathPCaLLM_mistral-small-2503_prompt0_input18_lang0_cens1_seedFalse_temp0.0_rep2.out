Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample material obtained, so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement indicates that >95% of the material appears benign, and the suspicious focus is too small to properly assign a grade group. Therefore, it is marked as "no".
3. **reported_gleason_grade**: Since the statement indicates that the material is benign and the suspicious focus is too small to assign a grade group, it is marked as "NA".
