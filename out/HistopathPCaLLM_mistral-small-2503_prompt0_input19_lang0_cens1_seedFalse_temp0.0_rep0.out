Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the original sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions uncertainty about the possibility of malignant tissue, but it does not confirm malignant findings, so it is marked as "NA".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there are no confirmed malignant findings, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
