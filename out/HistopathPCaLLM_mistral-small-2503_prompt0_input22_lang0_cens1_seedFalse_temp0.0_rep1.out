Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue sampling material," which typically refers to a biopsy.
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement indicates that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed, so it is not possible to determine if there are malignant findings.
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement mentions that assigning a Gleason grade is exceptionally difficult, so it is not applicable (NA).
