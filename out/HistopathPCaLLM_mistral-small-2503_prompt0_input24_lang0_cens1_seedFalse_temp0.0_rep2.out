Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: The statement mentions "biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings," but it does not specify the type for the most severe lesion. Therefore, it is "NA".
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement indicates that the material was benign and only upgraded to low-grade Gleason scores (3+3 or 3+4), which are not considered malignant in the context of this task. Therefore, it is "no".
3. **reported_gleason_grade**: Since there were no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
