Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement concludes that the presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified, so it is "no".
3. **reported_gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
