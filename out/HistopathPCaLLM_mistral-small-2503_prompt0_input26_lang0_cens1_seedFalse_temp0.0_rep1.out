Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions a possible 'Gleason sum 7', indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings, so it is marked as "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement mentions a possible 'Gleason sum 7' but notes that it is unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified, so it is marked as "NA".
