Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be a "biopsy" because the statement mentions multiple regions of interest inspected due to elevated PSA status, which is typical for a biopsy procedure.
2. There are no malignant tumor findings explicitly mentioned, so the value is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
