```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the original sample type, so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so it is "yes".
3. **gleason_grade**: The statement mentions a Gleason grade of 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, so it is "4+3=7".
