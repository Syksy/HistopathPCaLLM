Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions that the lymph nodes and seminal vesicles were clear, indicating no malignant findings, but it does not provide specific information about the prostate tissue itself, so it is "NA".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there is no mention of a malignant tumor or Gleason grade, it is "NA".
