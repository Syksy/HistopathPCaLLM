Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sample Type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is "NA".
2. **Malignant Findings**: The statement mentions "high-grade PIN-changes" and "hyperplasia," but these are not malignant findings. Therefore, it is "no".
3. **Gleason Grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
