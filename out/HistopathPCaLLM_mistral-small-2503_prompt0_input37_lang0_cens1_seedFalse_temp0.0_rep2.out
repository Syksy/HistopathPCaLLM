Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation," but it does not indicate any malignant findings, so it is "no".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
