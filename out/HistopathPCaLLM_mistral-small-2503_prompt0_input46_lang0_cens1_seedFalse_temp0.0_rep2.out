Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement indicates that it is not possible to assess whether there are cancer-related changes, but it mentions findings that might coincide with basal cell hyperplasia, which is benign. Therefore, "no".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
