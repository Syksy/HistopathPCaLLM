Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",

}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions changes that warrant further investigation but does not confirm malignancy, so it is "NA".
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there is no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
