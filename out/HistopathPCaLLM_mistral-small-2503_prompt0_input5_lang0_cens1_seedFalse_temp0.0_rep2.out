Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **original_sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_tumor_findings**: The statement mentions that "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings" and "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred," indicating no malignant findings. Therefore, it is marked as "no".
3. **reported_gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
