Here is the structured data in JSON format based on the provided statement:

```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **sample_type**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is marked as "NA".
2. **malignant_findings**: The statement mentions that samples with indices 1 and 2 are free of malignant findings, and the most severe lesion (sample 3) does not report a grade score, indicating no malignant findings in the most severe lesion.
3. **gleason_grade**: Since there are no malignant findings reported in the most severe lesion, the Gleason grade is marked as "NA".
