Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so it is marked as "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings, so it is marked as "NA".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions a Gleason 7 score from a different patient, but it does not provide a definitive Gleason grade for the current patient, so it is marked as "NA".
