Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not specified in the statement, so it is "NA".
2. The statement mentions "suspicious foci" and "various grades of cell differentiation," indicating the presence of malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is "yes".
3. The statement explicitly mentions that assigning explicit Gleason scores is inconclusive, so "Gleason" is "NA".
