Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not specified, so it is "NA".
2. The statement indicates that examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies, so there are no malignant tumor findings, hence "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
