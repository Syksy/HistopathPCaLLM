Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not specified as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other clear type, so it is "NA".
2. The statement indicates that the samples cannot be assessed for malignancies, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
3. Since the Gleason grade cannot be determined due to the highly fragmented and varying samples, "Gleason" is "NA".
