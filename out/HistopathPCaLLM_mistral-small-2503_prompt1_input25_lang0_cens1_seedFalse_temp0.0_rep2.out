Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not specified as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other clear type, so it is "NA".
- The presence of malignant tumor findings cannot be reliably verified, so it is "NA".
- The Gleason grade cannot be assessed due to the unreliable conclusions, so it is "NA".
