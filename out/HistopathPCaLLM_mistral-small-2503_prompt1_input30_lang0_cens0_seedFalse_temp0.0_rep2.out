Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "TURP" (Transurethral Resection of the Prostate) based on the mention of "chippings near the urothelial cells."
2. The statement indicates the presence of adenocarcinoma, so "Malignancy" is "yes."
3. The most severe lesion is described with Gleason grades 4 (most common pattern) and 3 (secondary pattern), resulting in a sum of 4+3=7.
