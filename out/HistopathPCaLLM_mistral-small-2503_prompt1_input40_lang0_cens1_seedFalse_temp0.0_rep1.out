Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is inferred to be "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) because the material weight and the number of cassettes suggest a whole prostate specimen, which is typical for RP.
2. There are no malignant tumor findings mentioned, only hyperplastic prostate and inflammation.
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
