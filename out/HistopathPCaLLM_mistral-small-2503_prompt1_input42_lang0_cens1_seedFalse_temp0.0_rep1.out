Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not specified as "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or any other recognizable type, so it is "NA".
2. The statement does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings, so it is "NA".
3. Since there is no confirmation of malignancy, the Gleason grade is "NA".
