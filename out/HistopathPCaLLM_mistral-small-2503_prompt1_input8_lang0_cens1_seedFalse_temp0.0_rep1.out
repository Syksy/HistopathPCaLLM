Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original sample type is not explicitly stated, so it is "NA".
2. There are no malignant tumor findings in the most severe lesion (sample 3), so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since there are no malignant findings, the Gleason grade is "NA".
