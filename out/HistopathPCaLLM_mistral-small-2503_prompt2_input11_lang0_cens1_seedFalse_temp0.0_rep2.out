Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement does not specify the type of sample, so it is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement mentions that the evaluation of high-grade PIN presence remains inconclusive, but it does not confirm the presence of malignant tumor findings. Therefore, it is "no".
3. **Gleason**: The statement mentions Gleason scores but indicates that they could not be reliably assessed. Therefore, it is "NA".
