Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The statement does not specify the type of sample (biopsy, RP, TURP), so "Sampletype" is "NA".
- The statement mentions "irregularities" and "suspicious pattern" but does not confirm the presence of a malignant tumor, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
- There is no mention of Gleason grades, so "Gleason" is "NA".
