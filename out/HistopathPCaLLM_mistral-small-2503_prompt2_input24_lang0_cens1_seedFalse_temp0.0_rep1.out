Based on the provided statement, the structured data should reflect the most severe lesion found, which in this case is the upgrading to Gleason 3+4. Here is the structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Sampletype**: The statement mentions multiple types of samples (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or shavings), but it does not specify the type for the most severe lesion. Therefore, it is "NA".
2. **Malignancy**: The statement indicates that some cases were upgraded to malignant findings, specifically to Gleason 3+4. Therefore, it is "yes".
3. **Gleason**: The most severe lesion mentioned is Gleason 3+4, which sums to 7. Therefore, it is "3+4=7".
