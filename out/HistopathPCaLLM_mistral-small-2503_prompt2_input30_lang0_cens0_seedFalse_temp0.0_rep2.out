Based on the provided statement, here is the structured data in JSON format:

```json
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
- The sample type is not specified in the statement, so it is "NA".
- The statement mentions "atypical patterns" and "burn artefacts" making interpretation difficult, but it does not clearly confirm the presence of a malignant tumor. Therefore, "Malignancy" is "NA".
- The Gleason grade is mentioned but in a context that does not clearly indicate a definitive diagnosis due to the uncertainties and artifacts. Therefore, "Gleason" is "NA".
