Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format would be:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The statement mentions "prostatic operation material," which implies a radical prostatectomy (RP).
2. The statement does not provide any information about malignant tumor findings, so "Malignancy" is "NA".
3. Since the results are inconclusive and no Gleason grade is mentioned, "Gleason" is "NA".
