Based on the provided statement, the structured data in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:
1. The sample type is not explicitly stated, so it is "NA".
2. The statement mentions that samples 1 and 2 are free of malignant findings, and the most severe lesion (sample 3) does not report a specific Gleason grade, so "Malignancy" is "no".
3. Since no specific Gleason grade is reported for the most severe lesion, "Gleason" is "NA".
