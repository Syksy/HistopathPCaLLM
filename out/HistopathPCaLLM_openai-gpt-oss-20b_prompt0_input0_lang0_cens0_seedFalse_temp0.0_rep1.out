analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement indicates a histological examination of benign prostate tissue with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. So malignant tumor findings are "no". Gleason grade would be "NA" because no malignant. Sample type: The sample is from a 'Chipping samples' of prostate. This is likely a "biopsy" or "RP"? "Chipping samples" suggests a prostate biopsy or a resection? Could be "biopsy" because they took tissue. It's not a radical prostatectomy (RP) because they said "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks." That sounds like a biopsy or maybe a TURP? But likely a biopsy. Let's interpret as "biopsy". So:

- original sample type: "biopsy"
- malignant tumor findings: "no"
- reported Gleason grade: "NA"

Return JSON with these fields. The instructions say only result from most severe lesion. In this case benign. So output those. Also no nested structures. Let's produce JSON.assistantfinal```json
