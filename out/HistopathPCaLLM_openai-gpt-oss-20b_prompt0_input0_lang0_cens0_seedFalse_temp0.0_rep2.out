analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement. The question: Provide structured answers for three fields. We must only return the results from the most severe lesion. It's benign. So fields: 1. original sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement mentions "Chipping samples" – not necessarily a biopsy? The sample type appears to be "biopsy" or "RP"? Actually chipping samples from a prostate likely from a biopsy or surgical specimen. But we can infer "biopsy". The statement says "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks." So it's a biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy".

2. Malignant tumor findings: no. So "no".

3. Reported Gleason grade: "NA" because benign. So "NA".

Return JSON. Ensure no nested structures. So something like:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Ok.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",

  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
