analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed, but any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. From this material reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to produce structured data: sample type, malignant tumor findings, Gleason grade.

Allowed sample type values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".

We don't have explicit sample type. It's "A lot sample material was obtained". Not specific. So sample type likely NA.

Malignant tumor findings: The statement says "any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." So we cannot determine. So malignant tumor findings is NA? The allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". We cannot say yes or no. So NA.

Reported Gleason grade: For malignant statements we provide major+minor sum. But since no malignant, use NA. So output JSON with fields:

{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

We must ensure valid JSON format. We'll produce that.assistantfinal```json
