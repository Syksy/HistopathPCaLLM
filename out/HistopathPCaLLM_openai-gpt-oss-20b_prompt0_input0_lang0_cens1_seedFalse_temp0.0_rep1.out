analysisWe need to parse the statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed, but any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. From this material reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to produce JSON with three fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, Gleason grade.

Original sample type: The statement does not specify biopsy, RP, TURP. So NA.

Malignant tumor findings: The statement says no inference can be conducted, cannot conclude malignancy. So "no" or "NA"? The allowed values: yes, no, or NA. Since it cannot conclude, but it doesn't say "no" explicitly. They say cannot conclude. That implies uncertain. So "NA". The instructions say only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned. But we have no malignant lesion. So malignant tumor findings = "no"? Actually "no" indicates confirmed absence of malignancy. But here we don't have confirmation. So use "NA". For benign? They say cannot conclude if benign. It's uncertain. So "NA".

Gleason grade: For malignant statements, use major+minor=sum. For benign, "NA". We have no malignant. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Check formatting. Use snake_case or lower? The instructions: Provide answers to the following three structured fields: 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements).

Thus keys can be "sample_type", "malignant_tumor_findings", "gleason_grade". Provide JSON. Ensure valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
