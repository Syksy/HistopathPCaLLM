analysisWe must parse the statement. Determine sample type: The statement says "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed." No mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. So likely "NA". Next, were there malignant tumor findings? The statement: "but any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted." No malignant findings. So "no". The Gleason grade: Since no malignant, "NA". Return JSON with fields: sample_type, malignant_findings, gleason_grade. Ensure JSON valid.assistantfinal```json
