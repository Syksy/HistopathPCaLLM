analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says: "12 representative needle biopsies are being inspected from standard sampling locations. Total length of the samples is approx. 150mm. Normal grandular structures are observed along with wave-like epithelial structures with hyperplastic characteristics. The conclusion is that only benign-like growth is observed. MD, John Doe."

We need to produce 3 fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, reported Gleason grade. In the statement, sample type: "needle biopsies" -> biopsy. malignant tumor findings: no, benign-like growth only. Gleason grade: NA. Also "only benign-like growth is observed." So yes. Provide JSON. The output should be a JSON object with keys: sample_type, malignant, gleason_grade. According to allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA" for sample type. So "biopsy". malignant tumor findings: "no". Gleason grade: "NA". Return valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
