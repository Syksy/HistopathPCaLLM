analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement. We need to produce JSON with three fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, reported Gleason grade.

Allowed values: sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Malignant tumor findings: "yes", "no" or "NA". Gleason grade: major+minor=sum whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements.

We need to return only the results from the most severe lesion. But here only benign-like growth observed. So malignant tumor findings should be "no". Gleason grade "NA". Sample type: "biopsy" because needle biopsies. So JSON:

{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_glasson_grade": "NA"
}

Wait field name: "reported Gleason grade" but JSON key must be like "reported_glasson_grade"? They said provide answers to the following three structured fields: 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values:...). 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values...). 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values...). So keys could be "sample_type", "malignant_tumor_findings", "reported_glasson_grade"? They spelled "Gleason" not "Glasson". So key "reported_glasson_grade" is wrong. Use "reported_gleason_grade". But they didn't specify key names. I think we can use "sample_type", "malignant_tumor_findings", "reported_gleason_grade". Provide JSON. No nested structures. So final.assistantfinal```json
