analysisWe need to produce structured data from the given statement. The fields:

1. original sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
2. malignant tumor findings: "yes", "no" or "NA".
3. reported Gleason grade: "major+minor=sum" whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements.

We need to interpret the statement. The statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. Total amount of sample material is sufficient. Mostly normal cell architectures are observed along with a focus on inspecting epithelial cell characteristics. However, the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings. MD, John Doe."

This is a report about prostate samples. It says "Representative prostate cancer samples" but actually "mostly normal cell architectures are observed". The results appear inconclusive. Additional inspection required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings. So we have no definitive malignant findings. This is inconclusive. So malignant tumor findings: "NA" or maybe "no"? The instruction: only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned. The structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to the following three structured fields.

We have no definitive malignant tumor findings, it's inconclusive. So malignant tumor findings: "NA". Or maybe "no" if we interpret as no malignant findings. But the statement says inconclusive. I'd lean "NA". The sample type: it's a standard sample location, presumably "biopsy" as it's a representative sample. But the statement doesn't explicitly say "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It says "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations". That likely refers to biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy". Gleason grade: NA because inconclusive or benign. So final JSON: {"sample_type":"biopsy","malignant_findings":"NA","glien_grade":"NA"}.

But we need to produce JSON. Let's ensure format correct.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
