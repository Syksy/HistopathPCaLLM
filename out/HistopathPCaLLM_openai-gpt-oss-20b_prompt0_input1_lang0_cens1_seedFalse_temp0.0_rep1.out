analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is:

"Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. Total amount of sample material is sufficient. Mostly normal cell architectures are observed along with a focus on inspecting epithelial cell characteristics. However, the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings. MD, John Doe."

We need to answer three fields:

1. Original sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement says "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected." No explicit mention of biopsy or RP or TURP. It says "samples" presumably from standard locations; could be biopsy. But we have to choose one. Since no explicit mention, maybe "NA". But we might infer it's a biopsy because it says "samples" and "standard locations" typical of biopsy. The safest is "NA" because not specified.

2. Malignant tumor findings: "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says "final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, additional inspection required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings." So we don't have a definitive malignant finding. So "NA" maybe. But the question: "Were there malignant tumor findings?" Since it's inconclusive, we might answer "NA". Because no definitive yes/no. So "NA".

3. Reported Gleason grade: "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements or "NA" for benign. Since not malignant, "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

We should output valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
