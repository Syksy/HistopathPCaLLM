analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, and reported Gleason grade. The statement: "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." So sample type: autopsy? Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". It's not any of these, so "NA".

Malignant tumor findings: the statement says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but cannot be reliably inferred. So malignant tumor findings: "NA" or "no"? It's uncertain, but probably "NA" because not definitive. The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since it's uncertain, perhaps "NA". I'll choose "NA".

Reported Gleason grade: Since there's no definite malignant finding, it's "NA".

Thus JSON: {"sample_type":"NA","malignant_finding":"NA","gleason_grade":"NA"} Ensure proper JSON, no nested.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_finding": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
