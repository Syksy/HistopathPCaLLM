analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's an autopsy specimen. Sample type: "autopsy"? Allowed values are biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Autopsy is not one of those, so NA. Malignant tumor findings? The statement says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but not confirmed; "cannot be reliably inferred". So malignant findings: no? Actually it says "can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes". That implies uncertain. But the question: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: yes, no or NA)". Since no definitive malignant findings, I'd say "no". Gleason grade: Since no malignant findings, "NA".

Hence output JSON: {"sample_type":"NA","malignant_findings":"no","gleason_grade":"NA"}

We need to output valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
