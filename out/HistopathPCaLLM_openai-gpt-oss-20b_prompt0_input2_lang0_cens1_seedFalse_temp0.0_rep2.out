analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about an autopsy specimen intended for research use. Not a biopsy, not RP, not TURP. So sample type: "NA" (not applicable). Were there malignant tumor findings? The summary says: "samples can be only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes in otherwise normal tissue that do exhibit inflammatory and age-related changes." It says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" - but no definitive findings. The microscopic inspection reveals various types of cell growth, some atrophy and inflammation. No malignant findings are stated. So malignant tumor findings: "no". Gleason grade: Since no malignant findings, we set "NA".

Return JSON with fields: sample_type, malignant, gleason_grade. Ensure keys names as requested: "original sample type", "malignant tumor findings", "reported Gleason grade" probably. But the instructions say "Provide answers to the following three structured fields:" then list them. They didn't give key names; we can use keys: "original_sample_type", "malignant_tumor_findings", "reported_gleason_grade". Use snake case. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
