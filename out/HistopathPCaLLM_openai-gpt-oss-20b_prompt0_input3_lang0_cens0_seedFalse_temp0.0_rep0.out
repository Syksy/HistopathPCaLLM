analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason grade.

Statement: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings. The material is started on one casette. In histologial inspection, spotted chronic inflammation is apparently, and the material gives an overall impression of stromal hyperplasia. Nothing indicating malignancy is found."

Sample type: "prostate chippings" is typically from biopsy? Prostate chippings could be from TURP or biopsy? "Chippings" often from prostatectomy? But context: "Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings." That is likely from a prostatectomy? But they mention "started on one casette", which is typical for surgical specimens. In pathology, "chippings" are usually from a transurethral resection (TURP) or prostatectomy? Actually "prostate chippings" often refers to tissue fragments from a prostatectomy or resection. However the sample type options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". RP stands for radical prostatectomy. TURP is transurethral resection. Biopsy is needle. "Chippings" is typical for TURP: tissue fragments from TURP. But also could be from RP. They mention "started on one casette" indicates a surgical specimen; but "prostate chippings" might come from TURP. Let's decide: The sample type is likely "TURP" because chippings are typical of TURP. But consider weight: 12.3g is relatively large for chippings; RP specimens are larger. But "chippings" suggests tissue fragments, not whole organ. I'd choose "TURP".

Malignant tumor findings: "Nothing indicating malignancy is found." So "no".

Gleason grade: For benign, we provide "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "sample_type": "TURP",
 "malignant": "no",
 "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

We should use exactly the allowed values. So sample_type: "TURP". malignant: "no". Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
