analysisWe need to produce structured data with three fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, Gleason grade. Allowed sample types: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. The statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run. In histological inspection, some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run."

Interpretation: This is likely a radical prostatectomy? It says "primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run." That seems like a prostate tissue sample, maybe from radical prostatectomy (RP) or possibly from TURP. But "primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material" indicates a large specimen, likely from radical prostatectomy. There's no mention of biopsy. So sample type: RP. Are there malignant tumor findings: None conclusive; "nothing conclusive may be derived." There's no mention of malignancy. So malignant tumor findings: no? But we cannot say yes because no evidence. But "malignant tumor findings" maybe "NA" because not determined. The allowed values: yes, no, NA. If nothing conclusive, ambiguous. But we should answer "NA" for malignant tumor findings? They want to answer yes/no/NA. Since no malignant tumor findings are reported, we could say "no". But maybe "NA" because not enough info. The instructions: "Only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned." But there's none. So we could say "NA" for malignant tumor findings. For Gleason grade: "NA" for benign statements. So we output "NA" for grade. So final JSON:

{
 "sample_type": "RP",
 "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
 "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Check if sample type should be "RP" or "NA". It seems to be a radical prostatectomy sample. So "RP". So final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}
```
