analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: sample type, malignant findings, Gleason grade. We must consider only worst lesion results and no nested structure. The sample is likely a biopsy? Let's interpret: "Primäärinäyte" means primary specimen, "yli tusinasta grammasta prostatamateriaalia" (over ten grams of prostate material) that is processed in one go. That sounds like a radical prostatectomy (RP), which usually is whole organ, but a specimen over ten grams could be a biopsy? 10 grams is large. But typical prostate biopsy is 0.1g? So more likely this is a radical prostatectomy. But the phrase "Primäärinäyte" could refer to a primary sample from surgery. In pathology, "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So sample type likely "RP".

Malignant findings: It says there is some inflammation but due to artifact cannot reliably examine. So no mention of malignancy. So "ei".

Gleason: For no malignant lesions, "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "sample_type": "RP",
 "malignant_findings": "ei",
 "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Check allowed values. For sample_type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" allowed.

malignant_findings: "kyllä", "ei", "NA". So "ei".

gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant. "NA" otherwise. So "NA".

Return as JSON. Ensure no nested structure. Just plain JSON object.assistantfinal```json
