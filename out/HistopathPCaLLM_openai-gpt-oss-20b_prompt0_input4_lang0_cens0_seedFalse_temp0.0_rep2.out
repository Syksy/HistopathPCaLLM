analysisWe need to parse the statement. It describes samples 1 to 6 are prostate biopsies. Sample 3 not representative. Otherwise the samples are representative and benign. No adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So malignant tumor findings? No. Gleason grade? NA. Sample type? biopsy. So JSON with fields: "original_sample_type": "biopsy", "malignant_tumor_findings": "no", "reported_gleason_grade": "NA". Ensure no nested. Output as JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "original_sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "no",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "NA"
}
