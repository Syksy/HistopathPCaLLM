analysisWe need structured data: sample type, malignant tumor findings, Gleason grade. Input: "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations. One sample part appears to be not representative, as it contains no prostate tissue. Otherwise the sampled tissue appears representative of prostate tissue. While no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue, the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes."

Interpretation: This is likely a biopsy sample? It says sampling sites available from standard locations. Could be biopsy. We have no mention of RP or TURP. Likely "biopsy".

Malignant tumor findings: The sample is insufficient to reliably assess presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So we don't know if malignant. So malignant tumor findings = NA? The options are yes, no, NA. If insufficient, likely NA because can't determine. So "NA".

Reported Gleason grade: Since malignant findings NA, we set "NA".

Thus JSON: { "sample_type":"biopsy", "malignant_tumor_findings":"NA", "reported_gleason_grade":"NA" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "biopsy",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "NA",
