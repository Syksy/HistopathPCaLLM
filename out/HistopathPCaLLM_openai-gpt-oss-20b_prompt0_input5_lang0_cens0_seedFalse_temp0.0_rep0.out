analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: sample type, malignant tumor findings, reported Gleason grade. Only the most severe lesion. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignant findings: yes. Gleason grade: we need the most severe lesion's Gleason pattern. The text: Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, dominant 4 60%. Macro B higher sum (9) observed of architecture 4+5, with proportions approx 50% and 20%. So macro B has 4+5 sum 9. That's the most severe. So reported Gleason grade "4+5=9" or "4+5=9". They want "major+minor=sum" form. So "4+5=9". So JSON: { "sample_type": "RP", "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes", "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9" }. Ensure no nested structures. Provide in valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant_tumor_findings": "yes",
  "reported_gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
