analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: original sample type, malignant tumor findings, reported Gleason grade. For the statement, sample type is radical prostatectomy: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP". Are there malignant findings? Yes. Reported Gleason grade: we need the most severe lesion. Which is the highest sum? Macro B has 4+5 sum 9. Macro A has 4+3 sum 7. So most severe is 9. So reported Gleason grade = "4+5=9". If format allowed is "major+minor=sum". So "4+5=9". Provide JSON. Ensure no nested structures. Just keys. Probably keys: sample_type, malignant, gleason_grade. Use allowed values. Provide final JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
```
