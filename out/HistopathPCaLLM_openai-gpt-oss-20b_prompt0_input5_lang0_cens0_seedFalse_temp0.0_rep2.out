analysisWe need to parse the statement and output JSON with three fields:

1. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy)
2. Malignant tumor findings: yes
3. Gleason grade: we need the most severe lesion. The statement describes macro A: 4+3 = 7; macro B: 4+5 = 9. The most severe is 4+5=9. So output "4+5=9" as major+minor=sum. So "4+5=9". Should we include spaces? Probably no spaces: "4+5=9". The JSON should have keys: "sample_type", "malignant", "gleason_grade".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "RP",
  "malignant": "yes",
  "gleason_grade": "4+5=9"
}
