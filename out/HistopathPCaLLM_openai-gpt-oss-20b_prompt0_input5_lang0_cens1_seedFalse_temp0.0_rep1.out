analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological report. Determine sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate. Samplings from the left have been processed with yellow dye and samplings from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + crossed). Based on reading the report produced by a colleague, the samples are indexed as A to H. Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings. Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred. Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection. Based on the patient's clinical report from the referral center, it would be likely that prostate capsule is intact and likely no perineural invasion has occurred either."

It says samples from both apex and basis, but no mention of biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), TURP. It says "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It's likely a biopsy? It says "samples taken" but doesn't specify the procedure. Since not specified, maybe NA. But allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So if cannot infer, return NA.

Malignant tumor findings: The report says microscopically clear prostate tissue across all samples. No malignant finding mentioned. Major and minor Gleason classes could not be inferred. Suspected higher sum one referred. But no malignant found. So malignant tumor findings: "no" (since clear tissue). Unless the suspected higher sum one is considered malignant? The text: "suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." But it's uncertain. The question: "Were there malignant tumor findings (yes, no, NA)". Since no definitive malignant, answer no? But there is suspicion but not confirmed. So "no".

Gleason grade: For malignant statements, "major+minor=sum". For benign, "NA". Since no malignant, use NA.

Thus JSON: {"sample_type":"NA","malignant_findings":"no","gleason_grade":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "sample_type": "NA",
  "malignant_findings": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
