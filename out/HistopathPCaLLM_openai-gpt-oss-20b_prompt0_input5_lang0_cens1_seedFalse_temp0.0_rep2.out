analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement describes a prostate sample. It's not explicitly biopsy, RP, TURP. It says "The sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate." It mentions "Samplings from the left have been processed with yellow dye and samplings from right with green dye. Samples taken from both apex and basis are processed (inspected longitudinally + crossed). Based on reading the report produced by a colleague, the samples are indexed as A to H. Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." That suggests no malignant cells observed. "Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred. Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." So we cannot infer Gleason. "Based on the patient's clinical report from the referral center, it would be likely that prostate capsule is intact and likely no perineural invasion has occurred either." No malignant tumor findings. So we have benign. So we should return sample type: "biopsy"? Or "NA"? The statement doesn't specify the procedure: "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate" but likely a biopsy. But not explicitly. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since not specified, we should use "NA". Malignant tumor findings: "no". Gleason grade: "NA".

Thus: {"sample_type":"NA","malignant":"no","gleason_grade":"NA"}

We need JSON.assistantfinal```json
