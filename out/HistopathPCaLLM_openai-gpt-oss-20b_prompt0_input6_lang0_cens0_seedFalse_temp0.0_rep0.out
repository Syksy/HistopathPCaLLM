analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes. Microscopically relatively normal prostate grandular structures are observed, although a heavy burn artefact is present. Although glands are largely unobservable due to the artefacts, the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia."

Key: sample type: It's "shaving chips" presumably from a resection? The sample type options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "Shaving chips" likely from a transurethral resection? Shaving chips are resected tissue from TURP. So sample type "TURP".

Malignant tumor findings: The text says benign prostate hyperplasia. No malignant. So "no".

Gleason grade: benign => "NA".

Return JSON with fields: sample_type, malignant, gleason_grade.

Thus:

{
  "sample_type": "TURP",
  "malignant": "no",
  "gleason_grade": "NA"
}

Note: maybe "NA" for sample_type? But we think TURP. Provide valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
