analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Based on statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g... benign prostate tissue... no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma... Some spot-like inflammation... suspected benign prostate hyperplasia." So sample type: "biopsy" or "RP"? The statement says chipping samples, likely a biopsy? "Chipping" could be from TURP? But chipping samples might be transurethral resection? Actually chipping is often used in TURP. But the sample type allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "Chipping samples". That implies TURP. Because TURP involves chipping tissue. So sample type: "TURP". Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
