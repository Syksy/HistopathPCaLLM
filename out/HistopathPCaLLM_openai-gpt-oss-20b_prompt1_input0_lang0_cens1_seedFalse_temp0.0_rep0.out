analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed, but any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. From this material reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to provide structured JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Sampletype: possibilities: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The text says "A lot sample material was obtained" but not specifying. So sample type unclear => "NA".

Malignancy: "yes", "no", "NA". The statement says cannot infer malignancy. So we cannot say yes or no. => "NA".

Gleason: for malignant statements. Since no malignant statement, => "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure no extra whitespace or nested structure. Provide valid JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
