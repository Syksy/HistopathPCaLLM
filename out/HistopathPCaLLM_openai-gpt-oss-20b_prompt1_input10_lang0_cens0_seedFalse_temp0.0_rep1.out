analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples include 8 representative prostate systematic biopsies from typical locations, with total length approx 120mm. The slides show prostate tissue with some basal cell hyperplasia. In immonological stainings of samples 3-4, basal cells are highlighted and stainings positive, but the suspicious focus is too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma. Conclusion: Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign."

We need to produce structured data: Sampletype: biopsy (makes sense). Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The statement says suspicious but uncertain leaning toward benign. So not a definitive malignant tumor finding. So Malignancy = "no" or "NA"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". Since not malignant, we set "no". Gleason: Since no malignant, it's "NA".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

No nested. Just that. Need to ensure valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
