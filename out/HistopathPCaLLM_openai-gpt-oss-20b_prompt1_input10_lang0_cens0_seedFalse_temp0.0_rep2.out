analysisWe need structured data for the statement. Sample type: It says "Samples include 8 representative prostate systematic biopsies from typical locations". So sample type is "biopsy". Malignancy: "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." So malignant tumor findings? They say uncertain, leaning towards benign. So Malignancy should be "no" or "NA"? The allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If uncertain, but leaning benign. Should we consider malignant? It says uncertain, but leaning benign. "Suspicion-level finding" but not definitive carcinoma. So malignant tumor findings - probably "no" because it's not confirmed. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: For benign statements, use "NA". So Gleason: "NA". Provide JSON with keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Ensure no nested structures. Use sample type exactly "biopsy". Output JSON.assistantfinal```json
