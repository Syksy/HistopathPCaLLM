analysisWe need to parse the statement. The content is about prostate samples and mention normal basal cells, suspicious formations, but no mention of malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade. So Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')". Since it's about suspicion of staining failure, not mention of malignant tumor. So answer "no". Sample type: The statement says "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches..." It doesn't specify sample type like biopsy, RP, TURP. So "NA". Gleason: There is no malignant, so "NA". Return JSON with those fields. Also "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned" but there is none. So "NA" for Gleason.

Return:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Check formatting.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",

  "Gleason": "NA"
