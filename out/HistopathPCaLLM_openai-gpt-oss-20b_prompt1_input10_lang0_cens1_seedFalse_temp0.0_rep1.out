analysisWe need to parse the given statement. It's about prostate samples, but does it mention malignant tumor findings, Gleason? It says: "normal basal cells were observed in the prostate tissue material." No malignant tumor. "Suspicious formations that hinted at stainings failing were observed" but nothing about cancer. So Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The instructions: "were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since no malignant tumor findings, answer "no". Sample type: it's not specified explicitly, but it says "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches due to a logistics error" - type isn't biopsy, RP, TURP. So we should use "NA". Gleason: "NA" because benign. The statement says normal basal cells, no cancer. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check that no other fields. Good.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
