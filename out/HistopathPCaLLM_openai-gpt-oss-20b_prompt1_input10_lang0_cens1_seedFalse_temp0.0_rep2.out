analysisWe need to parse the text. Determine sample type: "prostate samples" but no specific type. It's not biopsy, RP, TURP. So "NA". Malignancy: "normal basal cells observed", no mention of malignant tumor. So "NA" or "no"? The allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". Since the statement says "normal basal cells observed... no mention of malignant lesions." So malignant tumor findings? It's "no". But we need to decide: Could be "no" because no malignant evidence. But also can be "NA" if uncertain. But there's no mention of malignant. So "no" seems correct. Gleason: Since no malignant, "NA". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype":"NA",
 "Malignancy":"no",
 "Gleason":"NA"
}

Check if any malignant. The text: "Suspicious formations that hinted at stainings failing were observed" but no mention of cancer. So yes "no".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
