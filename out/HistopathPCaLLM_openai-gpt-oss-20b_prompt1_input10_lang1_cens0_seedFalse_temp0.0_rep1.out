analysisWe need to parse the Finnish pathology report. The user wants to produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The sample type should be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". They say "Näytteinä 8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita" which means "samples: 8 pieces representative prostate system biopsies". So sample type is "biopsy". Malignancy: we need to decide if there were malignant findings. The report says "Suspicio-löydös biopsioista, mutta diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin." That means suspicious findings but diagnosis uncertain, leaning benign. There's no mention of malignant cells or adenocarcinoma. So Malignancy should be "ei" (no). Gleason: For benign, we use "NA". So JSON: { "Sampletype": "biopsy", "Malignancy": "ei", "Gleason": "NA" }.

We need to ensure no nested structures. Just plain JSON. The user wants to follow the example. So produce JSON exactly.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
