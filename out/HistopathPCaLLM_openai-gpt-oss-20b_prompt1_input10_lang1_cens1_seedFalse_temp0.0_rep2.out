analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text, produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Use allowed values: Sampletype: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", "NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant, or "NA" for benign.

We need to determine from text: the sample type, whether malignant findings, and Gleason. The text: It's about prostate tissue samples, eight separate samples due to logistic error. They mention "normaalia basaalisolukkoa" (normal basal cell count) found in material. They mention immunological staining panels in last two samples show clear patterns, panel works. Some weird shapes in earlier samples implying staining failed; final certainty not achieved. Conclusion: suspicion of panel failure in some samples, but majority showed expected patterns.

No mention of malignancy. So Malignancy = "ei" or "NA"? "ei" indicates not malignant. They didn't mention cancer or Gleason. So Gleason = "NA".

Sampletype: It seems these are samples from prostate, but type? The text: "Pyydetyt prostatanäytteet saapuivat kahdeksassa erillisessä erässä" - "requested prostate samples arrived in eight separate batches". They talk about biopsy? Not defined. Could be "biopsy". Usually "prostate tissue samples" from biopsies. They didn't mention RP (radical prostatectomy) or TURP. So likely "biopsy".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return JSON only.assistantfinal```json
