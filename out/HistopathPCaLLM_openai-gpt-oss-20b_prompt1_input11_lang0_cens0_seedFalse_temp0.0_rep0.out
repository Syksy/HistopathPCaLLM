analysisWe need to output JSON with keys Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sample type: it's a prostatectomy preparate, so "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". Ensure no nested structures. Provide these fields.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
