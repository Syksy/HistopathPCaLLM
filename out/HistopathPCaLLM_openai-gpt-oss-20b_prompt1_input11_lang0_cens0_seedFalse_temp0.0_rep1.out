analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type. The statement: "Prostatectomy preparate was run according to the standard protocol..." That indicates sample type: RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes (obviously invasive tumor tissue observed).

Gleason grade: the statement says "Gleason grading 4+3". So major+minor=4+3=7. Should we include sum? The example includes 4+3=7. So we should do "4+3=7".

Thus final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype":"RP",
 "Malignancy":"yes",
 "Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Good.

Malignancy: "yes" or "no" or "NA". good.

Gleason: "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers. So "4+3=7".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
