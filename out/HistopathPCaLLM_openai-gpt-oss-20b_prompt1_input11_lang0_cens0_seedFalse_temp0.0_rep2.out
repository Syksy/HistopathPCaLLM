analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "Prostatectomy preparate was run according to the standard protocol..." This is a prostatectomy specimen, so RP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". So output JSON. Ensure no nested structures.

Also include only the most severe lesion, but only one lesion. So correct.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
