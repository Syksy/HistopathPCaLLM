analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "electrosection shavings" from the prostate. The allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Electrosection shavings likely from a TURP? Actually TURP is transurethral resection of prostate. Electrosection shavings is a type of resection sample. So sample type likely TURP. Malignancy: "benign". So no malignant tumor findings: "no". Gleason: "NA" because benign. So JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"TURP",
"Malignancy":"no",
"Gleason":"NA"
}

Check that "Majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue => benign." yes. So answer.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
