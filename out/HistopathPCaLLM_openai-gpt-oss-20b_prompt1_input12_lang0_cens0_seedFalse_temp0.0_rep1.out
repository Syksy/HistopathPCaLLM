analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The obtained sample consist of electrosection shavings from the prostate and have been started in eight blocks. In histological examination, majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue like architecture, thus the material is classified as benign."

We need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Sampletype: allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. The sample is "electrosection shavings" from prostate. Electrosection shavings likely from radical prostatectomy or TURP? "Electrosection shavings" are from prostatectomy? In pathology, "electrosection shavings" come from a radical prostatectomy specimen. So sample type could be "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). The example says "biopsy" etc. So likely "RP". So Sampletype = "RP".

Malignancy: benign, so "no" or "NA"? The statement says material is benign. So Malignancy = "no".

Gleason: benign, so "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"RP","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
