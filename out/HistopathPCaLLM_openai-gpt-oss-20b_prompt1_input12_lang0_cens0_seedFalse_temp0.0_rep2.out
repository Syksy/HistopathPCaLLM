analysisWe need to parse the statement. The sample type: "electrosection shavings from the prostate". Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". "Electrosection shavings" presumably is from a prostatectomy? Might be from TURP? Actually "electrosection" is a term used for surgical tissue removal with electric scalpel, often used in TURP or RP. But sample type should be one of allowed. Since it's not biopsy, not RP (radical prostatectomy?), but could be "RP" if from prostatectomy. However description: "electrosection shavings from the prostate" could be from TURP. Likely "TURP" because it's electrosection shavings (transurethral resection of prostate). So sample type: "TURP".

Malignancy: benign.

Gleason: NA.
