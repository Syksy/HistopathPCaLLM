analysisWe need to produce structured data from the free text. The statement: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue."

We need to extract:

1. Sample type: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The text says "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." No mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. Could be "NA". But it says "suspected prostate cancer tissue". Usually this might be a biopsy or tissue from surgery. But no explicit type. So set "NA".

2. Were there malignant tumor findings? It says "suspected prostate cancer tissue" and "majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate". No malignant findings reported. So "no" or "NA"? The question says "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")". Since no malignant findings are reported, answer "no".

But we should consider that the sample is suspected of cancer. But no confirmation. So "no".

3. Gleason grade: Since no malignant statements, "NA".

Return a JSON with keys "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Thus:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check formatting: keys should match exactly? The example uses "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Good.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
