analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue."

We need to extract: sample type: possible values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue". Not specifying biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), or TURP. So sample type is NA? But maybe "biopsy" is typical for sampled tissue. However, the statement does not explicitly say biopsy. Could be a "biopsy" but not stated. The instruction says only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, but here we have no malignant findings. It says "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy: "no" maybe? But we need to decide. The statement says "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but no confirmation. So likely malignant tumor findings are "no" or "NA"? The allowed values: yes, no, or NA. If we cannot determine if malignant, maybe "NA". But the instruction: "were there malignant tumor findings" - if not present, "no". But if uncertain, maybe "NA". The statement doesn't mention malignant tumor findings. So I think "no". Gleason: "NA" because no malignant statement.

Sample type: likely "NA" because not specified. But maybe "biopsy" because it's a sample. But the allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches." This could be a biopsy. But it doesn't explicitly say "biopsy". I think "NA".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But maybe the instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned" and "structured result should not consist of nested structures." So just these fields.

Thus final answer.assistantfinal```json
