analysisWe need to parse the Finnish statement. The statement: "Näytteeksi saadut prostatan elektrosektiolastut on käynnistetty kahdeksassa blokissa. Histologisessa tarkastelussa näkyy pääasiassa säännöllistä prostatakudosta, löydös siis benigni." Means: "The sample obtained from the prostate electrosection(?) is in eight blocks. Histological examination shows mainly regular prostate tissue, finding is benign." So sample type: likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy) or "TURP"? The statement says "prostatan elektrosektiolastut" maybe "electrosection" from prostate? Not sure. The options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". Since it's not a biopsy, but a surgical specimen from prostate. It could be "RP" (radical prostatectomy). But "electrosection" maybe TURP? TURP is transurethral resection of prostate. Electrosection might refer to TURP. However the sample is "electrosection" from prostate, eight blocks. That seems like TURP. So sample type: "TURP". Malignancy: benign => "ei". Gleason: NA.

Return JSON with keys exactly "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide values accordingly.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". So "TURP" is allowed. Malignancy allowed: "kyllä", "ei", "NA". So "ei" is fine. Gleason allowed: "major+minor=sum" or "NA". So "NA" is fine.

Return only JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
