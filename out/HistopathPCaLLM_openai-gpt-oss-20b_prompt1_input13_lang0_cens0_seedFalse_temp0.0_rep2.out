analysisWe need to extract structured data: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

The statement: "The samples consist of prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations, totalling approx 60mm on the right and approx 80mm on the left. In sample B carcinoma is observed, reaching as far as Gleason score 5 and the total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5). This higher grade differentiation consists of approx 20% on the left. In rest of the samples normal grandular structures are observed, without any significant inflammation either."

So sample type: "biopsy" (needle biopsies). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+5=9 (though they gave "total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)". So we include "4+5=9" or maybe "4+5=9". According to pattern, they use "major+minor=sum". So "4+5=9" is correct.

Return JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "biopsy",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

No nested structures. That should be final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
