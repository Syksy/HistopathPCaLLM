analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing samples taken. It mentions sample B with irregularities, suspicious pattern. But not sure if malignant tumor findings. The statement says "suspicious pattern includes enough material for inspection and assessment from the left side, but at this time further verification is needed via consultation." It doesn't explicitly say malignant tumor findings, just suspicious pattern. So we might set Malignancy: "NA" or "no"? The instruction: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." If not explicitly malignant, maybe "no". But "suspicious pattern" implies uncertain. Could be "NA" because not determined. The instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." So we need sample type: The statement says "samples have been taken from typical locations in the prostate". It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. So sample type is likely "NA". Malignancy: Since no malignant tumor findings, "no". Gleason: benign statements or NA: "NA". So JSON: { "Sampletype": "NA", "Malignancy": "no", "Gleason": "NA" }. Check if there's any mention of malignant tumor. The phrase "suspicious pattern" might be ambiguous. But no explicit malignant. So "no". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
