analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We need to parse the given Finnish text. The text describes "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" meaning samples taken from prostate type locations. They talk about sample B etc. There's no clear mention of malignancy or Gleason. So we need to set fields accordingly.

Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The text: "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" - It says "samples taken from prostate type locations" but not specifying method. Could be biopsy? But typical "biopsy" is a sample from prostate. It could also be from any location. The safest is "NA" if not specified. The example says "Näytteet on otettu prostatan tyyppilokaatioista" - that might mean "taken from prostate type locations". Not a method. So "NA".

Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei" or "NA". There's mention of "suspekti patterni" but no definitive malignant findings. So we cannot say "kyllä". There's no mention of benign or malignant. So "NA".

Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA" for benign. Since we have no malignant, we set "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check formatting: JSON, keys in quotes. It's fine.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
