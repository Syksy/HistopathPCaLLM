analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "prostatetectomy preparate" – that is radical prostatectomy (RP). Sample type "RP". Malignancy? Yes, tumorous growth observed. So "yes". Gleason: They say "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with the larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". Gleason 7 = 3+4 or 4+3? They say "larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". So majority is score 3, remainder presumably 4. So major 3, minor 4 sum 7. So Gleason string "3+4=7". But we should use major+minor=sum. So "3+4=7". Output JSON.assistantfinal```json
