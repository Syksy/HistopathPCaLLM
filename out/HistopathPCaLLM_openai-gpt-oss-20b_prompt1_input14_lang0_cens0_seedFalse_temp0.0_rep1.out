analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "prostatectomy preparate". They say specimen consist of a prostatectomy preparate. That's a prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype: "RP". Were there malignant tumor findings? Yes. Gleason grade: reported as Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with larger portion of score 3 approx 60% in the findings. So Gleason 7 is sum of 3+4? Usually Gleason 7 = 3+4 or 4+3. They say larger portion is score 3 approx 60%. So probably major=4, minor=3. But they didn't specify major/minor. In example they had 4+3=7. So we can represent as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Which one? They said larger portion score 3 approx 60%. That indicates majority is 3, minority 4. So major=3, minor=4. But typical notation is major+minor. So we should use "3+4=7". But the allowed format is "major+minor=sum" with whole numbers. So "3+4=7". There is no mention of margin positivity. It's malignant yes. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

We should also confirm that sample type is "RP". Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct. Good.assistantfinal```json
