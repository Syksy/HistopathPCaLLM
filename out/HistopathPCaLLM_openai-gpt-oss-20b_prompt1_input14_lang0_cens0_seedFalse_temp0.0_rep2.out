analysisWe need to parse the statement. It describes a specimen from a prostatectomy preparate. So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: reported Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. That means Gleason score 7 (3+4? or 4+3?). They say larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. That implies 60% of tumor is Gleason 3 (primary) and 40% is Gleason 4 (secondary). That would be 3+4=7. So output: "3+4=7". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

We should ensure no nested structures. Use correct capitalization? The example used "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". We'll output exactly those keys.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
