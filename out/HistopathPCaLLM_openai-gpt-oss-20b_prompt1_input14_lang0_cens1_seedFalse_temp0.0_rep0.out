analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about prostate tissue, sample types unspecified. It says "specimen consists of a comprehensive overview... samples D-G... etc." It says "special patterns of cell growth are observed peripherally" but no explicit malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade reported. The last sentence mentions a different patient with Gleason 7, but not this patient. So for this patient, no malignant findings reported. So we return:

Sampletype: "NA" (since type not specified)
Malignancy: "no" (since no malignant tumor findings)
Gleason: "NA"

Return JSON.

Ensure format exactly.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
