analysisWe need to parse the Finnish text. The task: produce structured data: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Input: "Tutkittavaksi tullut prostatektomia-preparaatti,...". It's a prostatectomy specimen. So Sampletype="RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: "kyllä" because tumor present. Gleason: They say "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." So Gleason 7 (which is 3+4 or 4+3). They mention major+minor sum 7. They didn't give explicit major and minor numbers. But Gleason 7 can be 4+3 or 3+4; but we can report "7" but needed format "major+minor=sum". They didn't specify the breakdown; but we could approximate as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Which one to choose? The statement: "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." That means larger portion is scored 3, about 60% of the findings. So majority is grade 3, minority grade 4. So major=4 (minority). Minor=3? Wait: In Gleason scoring, the major component is the highest grade present. Here majority is grade 3, but the tumor is Gleason 7, meaning the major component is grade 4 (since 4>3). But they say majority is scored 3 (60%). So minor component is 4 (40%). So major=4, minor=3. So "4+3=7". We'll use that.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check that the format matches. Also we must not include nested structures. Just these keys. Good.assistantfinal```json
