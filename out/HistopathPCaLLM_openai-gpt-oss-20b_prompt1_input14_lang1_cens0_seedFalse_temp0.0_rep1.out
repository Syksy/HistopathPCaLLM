analysisWe need to parse the statement and produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. According to instructions: only the worst lesion results should be returned and no nested structures. Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". This sample is a prostatectomy-preparaatti, likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: is there malignant findings? The statement says "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa." So yes. "kyllä".

Gleason: For malignant findings, we need major+minor=sum format integer. Gleason 7-tasoista = 7. But they also mention "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä". That suggests majority is grade 3, but Gleason 3+4=7. They didn't give minor grade explicitly but typical Gleason 7 can be 3+4 or 4+3. They say largest part is 3 (score 3). So major is 4, minor is 3. So "4+3=7". We'll output that.

Thus JSON: { "Sampletype": "RP", "Malignancy": "kyllä", "Gleason": "4+3=7" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
