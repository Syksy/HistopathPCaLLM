analysisWe need to return JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Based on complementing clinical notes of the patient, the tissue material was processed with a high priority. Preliminary scopic inspection through the sample material confirms that the symptoms reported in the clinical notes may have a basis on histopathology, although representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time (clinical notes mentioned suspected presence of an adenocaricoma following disease trajectory akin to e.g. Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above, but this was not based on any histopathology). Potential findings have to be revised in the next histologic examination session, in order to be able to either confirm or discard the earlier suspicion."

We must interpret: sample type? It says "Prostate tissue material" - not biopsy, not RP, not TURP. It's unspecified – maybe "NA" because no specific sample type given. The text mentions "tissue material" - could be from surgery? But not specified. So Sampletype: "NA".

Malignancy: There's no confirmed malignant tumor findings, only suspicion. So "no" or "NA"? The instruction: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")." Since no findings, it's "no". Or maybe "NA" because not determined. But "no" seems more appropriate: no malignant tumor findings confirmed. However could be "NA" if unknown. The statement: "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time" and "Potential findings have to be revised" – so it's uncertain. But likely "NA" because not determined. But the question: "Were there malignant tumor findings" – if not determined, I'd say "NA". The example: if malignant, yes. If benign, "no". If unknown, "NA". So we should use "NA".

Gleason: Since no Gleason determined, "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But we need to be careful: The instruction says only results from the most severe lesion should be returned. There is no lesion. So "NA". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
