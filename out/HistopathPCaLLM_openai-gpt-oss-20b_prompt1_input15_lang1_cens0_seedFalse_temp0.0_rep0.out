analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish statement. Determine:

1. Sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." This seems like a biopsy of prostate core samples? They say "prostatans höylälastuja" meaning core biopsies. So sample type likely "biopsy". There's no mention of radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP. So "biopsy".

2. Was there malignancy? They mention "adenokarsinoomaa" present in almost all, so yes. So "kyllä".

3. Gleason: "edustavin Gleason 4:ää... piste summa 8." They say "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" and "pistesumma 8". That suggests maybe major=4, minor=4? But they say "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" meaning the dominant grade is 4. Gleason 8 can be 4+4 or 3+5? But they also mention "sen eri variantteja". But typical Gleason 8 is 4+4 or 3+5. They didn't specify the minor grade explicitly. But they say "pistesumma 8." So we can output "4+4=8" maybe. But the instruction: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So we need to output "4+4=8" presumably. But we must be careful: The sample says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" and "sen eri variantteja". That may indicate the minor could be 4 or 3? But "pistesumma 8" indicates sum 8. So likely 4+4 or 3+5. Which is more plausible? They mention "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" which is the dominant grade. The other variant might be 4 too? But "eri variantteja" could include 3? But sum 8 could be 4+4 or 3+5. But they said "edustavin 4". So major=4. Minor could be 4 or 3. But sum 8. The simplest: 4+4=8. We can output "4+4=8". There's no mention of 3+5. So we go with 4+4=8.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Return that.assistantfinal```json
