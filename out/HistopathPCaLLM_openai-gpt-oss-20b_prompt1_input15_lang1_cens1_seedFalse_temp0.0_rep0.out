analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Based on the text: It's about prostate tissue material, but we don't know if it's biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The text says "Prostatan kudosmateriaalin kokonaismäärä on varsin niukka kokonaisuudessaan, ja kaikki materiaali on prosessoitu." It doesn't specify the type. Maybe it's a prostate tissue (whole organ?) But it's not a biopsy; seems like a prostatectomy? "kudomateriaali" maybe from a surgery? Since no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, or TURP, we might set to NA. Malignancy: The text says no histopathology evidence currently; it says "toisin edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa" meaning no evidence. So Malignancy: "ei". Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Let's output that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
