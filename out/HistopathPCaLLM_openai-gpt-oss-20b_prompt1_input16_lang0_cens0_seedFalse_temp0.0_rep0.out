analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about fusion biopsies. Sample type: "fusion biopsies" but allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "biopsy" is appropriate. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? They say architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3. So major grade is 4, minor 3. So "4+3=7". The statement says "score 7 comes from 15mm length... architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3". So the major grade 4, minor 3. So output JSON: {"Sampletype":"biopsy","Malignancy":"yes","Gleason":"4+3=7"}. Ensure no nested. That's it.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
