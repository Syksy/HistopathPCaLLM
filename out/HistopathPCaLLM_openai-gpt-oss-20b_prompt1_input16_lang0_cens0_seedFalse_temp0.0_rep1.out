analysisWe need to parse the statement. It describes three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate. Sample type: "fusion biopsy" but allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Fusion biopsy likely falls under "biopsy". So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: yes, because carcinoma focuses.

Gleason: reported as score 7, architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of carcinoma part. So Gleason is 3+4=7. According to format major+minor=sum. The major is 4, minor 3? But the statement says "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part." Usually Gleason pattern 4 is more aggressive, so major is 4, minor is 3, sum 7. So "4+3=7". That matches example.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype":"biopsy",
 "Malignancy":"yes",
 "Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Check that no nested structures. Provide exactly that.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
