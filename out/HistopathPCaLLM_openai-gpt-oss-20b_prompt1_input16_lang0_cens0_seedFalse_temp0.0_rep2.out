analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "fusion biopsies" are a type of biopsy. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "fusion biopsies" from suspicious focus: that's a biopsy. So Sampletype = "biopsy".

Malignancy: yes, because carcinoma.

Gleason grade: "score 7", with architecture 3 covering 2/3 and architecture 4 covering 1/3. So major 3, minor 4 sum 7. So "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? The example used "4+3=7". But the order: major+minor=sum. Usually major is 4, minor 3. But they said "architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3" so major is 3? But typical Gleason: major is the predominant pattern, minor is the second. Here major is 3, minor 4. But they say "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3". So major 3, minor 4. The sum is 7. Format: "3+4=7".

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"biopsy",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"3+4=7"
}

Return only that.assistantfinal```json
