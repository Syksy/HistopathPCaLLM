analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a prostatectomy preparate. So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason grade: most severe lesion. It mentions multiple clear foci, most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. So the dominant or most severe? The dominant grade is 4, but Gleason grade is sum of major + minor. In prostate cancer, Gleason pattern 4 is the major, pattern 3 is the minor. So 4+3=7. They want "major+minor=sum" format. So "4+3=7". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Yes. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". Good. Gleason: "major+minor=sum". Good. Provide JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
