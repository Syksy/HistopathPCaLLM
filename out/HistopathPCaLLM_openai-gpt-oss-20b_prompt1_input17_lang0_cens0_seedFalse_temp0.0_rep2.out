analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a prostatectomy preparate. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: most severe lesion: grade 4 dominant with some grade 3. So Gleason score: 4+3=7. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check that we use allowed values. Sampletype: "RP" is allowed. Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7".

Return JSON. Ensure only that.assistantfinal```json
