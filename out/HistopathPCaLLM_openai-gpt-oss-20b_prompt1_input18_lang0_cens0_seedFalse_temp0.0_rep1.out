analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure are processed through 12 tissue blocks." So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy?). Usually "shaving procedure" might be a prostatectomy? Standard shaving procedure is likely a radical prostatectomy (RP). So sample type: "RP".

Malignant tumor findings: yes (there is carcinoma). So "yes".

Gleason: "7" but they gave Gleason sum 7, with major+minor? They said Gleason sum 7. Usually we represent as "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". But they didn't provide major/minor. They said "larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." Actually "stage 3" likely refers to Gleason pattern 3. So the larger fraction is pattern 3, 60% of tumor area. The rest must be pattern 4? That would make it 3+4=7. But we don't have explicit mention of pattern 4. It says "larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area." That suggests the rest is stage 4 (pattern 4). So major is 4, minor 3. So "4+3=7". That is consistent with typical representation. The statement "Gleason sum 7" but we can produce "4+3=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

But we must ensure the JSON exactly matches the required format. Should we use "Sampletype" exactly as key? Yes. "Malignancy" and "Gleason".

Return JSON.

Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
