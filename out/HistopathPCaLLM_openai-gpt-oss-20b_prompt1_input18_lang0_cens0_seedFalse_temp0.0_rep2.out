analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: statement refers to "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" processed through 12 tissue blocks. This is likely RP (radical prostatectomy) or could be TURP? It says chippings from standard shaving procedure. That is typical of a surgical specimen from a prostatectomy? Shaving procedure is used in TURP? Actually "shaving" is a technique in TURP to shave off tissue. But the phrase "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure" could refer to a prostatectomy? Might be "shaving procedure" in a TURP. The sample type: "TURP" likely. But we need to choose among "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". The text says "Chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure are processed through 12 tissue blocks." That sounds like a TURP specimen. So sample type "TURP".

Malignancy: yes, because carcinoma present.

Gleason: "7". But the statement says "Gleason sum 7". The formatting "major+minor=sum" expects something like "4+3=7". We need major+minor. We don't know major/minor. It says "Gleason sum 7". Could be 4+3? But not specified. We might need to use the sum only? The example uses "4+3=7". We want major+minor=sum. But we don't have major and minor separately. The statement only gives sum. We might still produce "7" or "NA"? But allowed values: "major+minor=sum" in form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements. If we cannot determine major/minor, maybe still produce "7"? But the format requires major+minor=sum. We can produce "7" but that might not fit. But maybe we can produce "7". But better to provide "7" as sum only. But example shows 4+3=7. The statement says "Gleason sum 7". So we can produce "7". But I think we still need major+minor. But can't. So perhaps "NA"? But that would be wrong. But the question: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we can provide "7" as sum but not major+minor. But "preferred" indicates that major+minor=sum is preferred, but if not available we can just put sum. So produce "7". But maybe we can guess major+minor: 4+3? It's typical. But not given. I'd just use "7". But maybe better to output "7" as sum. But the JSON must contain "Gleason": "7". Let's use that.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "7"
}

Check if sample type could be "RP"? The procedure called "shaving" is used in TURP. So "TURP". We'll output accordingly.
