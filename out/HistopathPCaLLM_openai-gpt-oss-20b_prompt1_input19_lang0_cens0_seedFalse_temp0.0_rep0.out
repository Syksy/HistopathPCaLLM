analysisWe need to parse the statement: The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from typical sampling locations. So sample type is biopsy. Malignant tumor findings? Yes, in sample 4 adenocarcinoma. Gleason grade: reported as G3 90% and G4 10%. So major=4 minor=3? Actually major is 4, minor 3, sum=7. So "4+3=7". Output JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Return only most severe lesion. So only sample 4. So sample type biopsy. Malignancy yes. Gleason "4+3=7". Ensure JSON format.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
