analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So sample type is biopsy. Malignancy: yes (since sample 4 has adenocarcinoma). Gleason: we need major+minor=sum. In sample 4, there is adenocarcinoma with larger portion Gleason 3 (approx 90%) and smaller part Gleason 4 (10%). So overall Gleason grade? Usually we take dominant pattern as major and secondary as minor. So major = 4? Actually the larger portion is G3 (90%) and smaller part G4 (10%). So dominant is G3, secondary G4. So Gleason is 3+4=7. But some might say 4+3=7 if you list major first. But spec says "major+minor=sum". So major is 3, minor is 4. So "3+4=7". Wait, they said "major+minor=sum". So major 3, minor 4 => "3+4=7". Let's check example: Example given says "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." They had major 4, minor 3 => 4+3=7. So they list major first. So we should list major then minor. So in this case major is 3, minor is 4. So "3+4=7". That matches.

Thus produce JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

We must not nest. Should we include "NA" for any? No.

Return only JSON.assistantfinal{"Sampletype":"biopsy","Malignancy":"yes","Gleason":"3+4=7"}
