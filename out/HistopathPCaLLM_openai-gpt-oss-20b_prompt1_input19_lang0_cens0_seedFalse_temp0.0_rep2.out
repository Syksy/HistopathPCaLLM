analysisWe need to output JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We only consider most severe lesion. Sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). So highest grade is 4. The sum is 3+4=7. So reported Gleason is "3+4=7".

Original sample type: statement says "targeted prostate biopsies" so sample type is "biopsy". Malignancy yes.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
