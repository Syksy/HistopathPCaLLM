analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is describing multiple samples. The instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". So we consider the most severe lesion among all samples: sample 4 has uncertain abnormal architecture, possibly malignant. But it's not confirmed. The statement says it's uncertain whether tissue material has been mixed with non-prostate tissue or if this is truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant). So it's uncertain. There's no definitive malignant tumor finding. So "Malignancy" should be "no" or "NA"? Let's interpret. They say "possibly malignant" but not confirmed. So we can't say yes. So we might say "no" because no definite malignant tumor findings reported. The sample type: The statement says "samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." It doesn't specify the exact sample type - could be biopsy? But it's not explicit. It says "samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." That implies that sample type is not specified. So we might choose "NA". The Gleason grade: Since no malignant findings, we use "NA". So final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But we need to check: Are there any malignant tumor findings? Only uncertain. So "no". Good. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
