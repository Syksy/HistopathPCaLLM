analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says: Samples: 1 unrepresentative, 2 and 3 healthy benign. Sample 4: uncertain whether tissue material is mixed with non-prostate or truly abnormal prostate tissue (possibly malignant). It hasn't concluded malignancy. There is no explicit Gleason. So we need to output the most severe lesion: sample 4 is possibly malignant but uncertain. Since no definitive malignant findings, we might set Malignancy: "NA" or "no"? The question: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." The statement doesn't confirm malignant tumor findings. So we could set "NA" because uncertain. Sample type: the statement says "The samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. So "NA". Gleason: "NA" because no grade.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json

  "Gleason": "NA"
