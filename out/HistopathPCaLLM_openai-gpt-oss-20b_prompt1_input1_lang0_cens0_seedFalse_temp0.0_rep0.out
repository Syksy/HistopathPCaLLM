analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields:

- Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA".
- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" in form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements.

The statement: "12 representative needle biopsies are being inspected from standard sampling locations. Total length of the samples is approx. 150mm. Normal grandular structures are observed along with wave-like epithelial structures with hyperplastic characteristics. The conclusion is that only benign-like growth is observed. MD, John Doe."

Thus sample type: "biopsy" (needle biopsies). Malignancy: "no" (only benign). Gleason: "NA" (since benign). So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return only that JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
