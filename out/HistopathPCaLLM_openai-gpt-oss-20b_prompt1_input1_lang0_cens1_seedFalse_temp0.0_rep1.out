analysisWe need to parse statement. It's a free text. We need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We have to only return the most severe lesion. But there's no malignant tumor findings. The text says "Mostly normal cell architectures are observed... interpretation still underway". No malignant findings.

Thus Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The allowed values: yes, no, or NA. Since no malignant tumor findings, we set "no". Gleason: NA. Sample type: the statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations". It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says representative samples. So likely "NA". Or maybe "biopsy"? But it's not explicit. We can choose "NA". The example says sample type is "biopsy" if it's a biopsy. The text doesn't say. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
