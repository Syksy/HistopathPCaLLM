analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. Total amount of sample material is sufficient. Mostly normal cell architectures are observed e.g. grandular and wave-like epithelial structures. Interpretation of the results is still underway and full report will be ready in the following days. MD, John Doe."

This is a report, but no explicit mention of sample type, malignant tumor findings, or Gleason grade. It's an interim observation: "mostly normal cell architectures". No malignant findings. So for malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Sample type: unknown? The statement says representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. It doesn't say biopsy, RP, TURP. So sample type: NA. So the JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Yes.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
