analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a prostatectomy (RP). The sample is a prostatectomy resection. The question: "What is the original sample type?" Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype: "RP".

Second: "Were there malignant tumor findings?" We have adenocarcinoma present. So "yes".

Third: Gleason grade: We need to report the most severe lesion. There are two foci: apex: Gleason 3+4 (sum=7). Basis: class 4+4 (sum=8). The most severe is 4+4=8. So Gleason: "4+4=8".

Return JSON with keys: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Check allowed values: Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+4=8".

Make sure formatting: JSON. No nested structures. Simple object.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
