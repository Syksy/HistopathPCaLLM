analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing prostate tissue samples that are heavily affected by therapies, making examination of possible adenocarcinoma impossible. It says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies... Even in hypothetical scenario if lower level Gleason (like 3+4) could be found". So no malignant tumor findings are confirmed. So Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? Since no malignant findings are reported, Malignancy: "no". Sample type: It says "obtained prostate tissue samples" but doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. The context: "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets". That could be a prostatectomy or RP? But likely biopsy? It doesn't specify surgical procedure. It's just tissue samples. Without clear type, we might choose "NA". The allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So we choose "NA". Gleason: Because no malignant findings, we set "NA".
