analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement says: "The obtained prostate tissue samples are divided... examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies... as the prostate tissue samples have been highly affected. Even in the hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found..."

Thus, we cannot confirm malignant tumor findings. The statement says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible". So no malignant tumor findings found. So Malignancy = "no". Sample type: The sample type is "prostate tissue samples" but not specified biopsy, RP, TURP. Likely "NA" because not clear. Gleason: NA because benign. So output JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
