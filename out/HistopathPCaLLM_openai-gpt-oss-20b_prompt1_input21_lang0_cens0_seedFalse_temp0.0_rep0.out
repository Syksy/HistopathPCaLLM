analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "Prostate chippings" presumably means "chippings" sample, maybe a type of prostate biopsy. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". "Chippings" seems like a form of biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy". Malignant tumor findings: yes. Gleason grade: The statement: "the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." It might refer to Gleason pattern 5 and 4. In a malignant statement, we need "major+minor=sum". The major is the higher pattern? Usually Gleason 5+4=9. But the statement says "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4". So likely major=5, minor=4, sum=9. So output: {"Sampletype":"biopsy","Malignancy":"yes","Gleason":"5+4=9"}.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
