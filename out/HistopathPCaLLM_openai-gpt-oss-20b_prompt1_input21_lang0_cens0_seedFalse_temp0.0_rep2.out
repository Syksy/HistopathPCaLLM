analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology. Fibromuscular stroma is prevalent along with carpet-like poorly differentiated growth in the stroma. Nuclei are enlargened, varying in size, and nucleolus are clearly visible. Roughly half of the area of the shavings contain tumor-like tissue, with the most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4."

We need to identify sample type: "chippings" likely "RP"? Actually chippings refers to "prostate chippings" from perhaps a prostatectomy? But "chippings" could be from a prostatectomy or a TURP. Usually "chippings" refers to "prostate chippings" from a prostatectomy. But allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So I think sample type is "RP". There's no other sample type. So "RP".

Malignancy: yes, because tumor-like tissue. So "yes".

Gleason: The most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4. So the report says most common is 5 and second most common is 4. Usually the Gleason score is major + minor. The major is 5 and minor is 4? But typical Gleason is major (most common) and minor (second most common). So major=5, minor=4. Sum=9. So we output "5+4=9". That matches the example.

Thus the JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

We need to ensure no nested structures. Provide final answer.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
