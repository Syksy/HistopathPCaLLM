analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet‑like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."

We need to identify sample type: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement says "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece" - no explicit mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. It's likely a surgical specimen? It says "extracted prostate material" maybe from surgery. But no mention of biopsy. The sample type is unclear. We might choose "NA". The question: "What is the original sample type (allowed values: 'biopsy', 'RP', 'TURP' or 'NA')." If unclear, use NA.

Were there malignant tumor findings? The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." It does not mention malignant. It says cannot assess due to noise. So malignancy: "NA" or "no"? The allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If cannot determine? The statement says technical noise confounds assessment. So we cannot determine. Likely "NA". The instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned" - but we have no lesion. We can't say malignant. So "no" would be wrong. I'd choose "NA".

What is the reported Gleason grade? For benign, "NA". For malignant: "major+minor=sum". Since we have no malignant, it's "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But check if "NA" is allowed for Malignancy? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". Yes.

Thus output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
