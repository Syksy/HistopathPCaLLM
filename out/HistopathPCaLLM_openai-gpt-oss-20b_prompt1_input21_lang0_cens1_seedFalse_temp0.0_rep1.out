analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is describing a prostate sample: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet‑like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."

We need to extract sample type, malignancy presence, Gleason grade. Sample type: It's extracted prostate material but not clear if biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Likely "biopsy" is typical for extracted fragments? But maybe it's not a biopsy but unspecified. The statement says "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments... of which about half been put to histology." That might be a biopsy. But could also be from a prostatectomy. But no mention of surgery. Could be a biopsy of prostate. So sample type: "biopsy". Malignancy: The statement says "stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns." No mention of adenocarcinoma or malignant. So likely "no" malignancy. Gleason: For benign or no malignant, should be "NA". So output JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"biopsy",
"Malignancy":"no",
"Gleason":"NA"
}

But we must ensure the output is valid JSON. Also we need to consider that if we can't determine sample type, we could use NA. But we think it's biopsy. The statement: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece". That sounds like a biopsy, not necessarily. But I'd choose "biopsy". So final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
