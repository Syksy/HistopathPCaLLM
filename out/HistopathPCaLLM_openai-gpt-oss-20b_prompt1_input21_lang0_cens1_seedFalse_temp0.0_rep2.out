analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a pathology report text. We need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We need to use only the most severe lesion. The statement: "The extracted prostate material totals several fragments 3/5g up to 8mm a piece, of which about half been put to histology. Although stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, the nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentation patterns. Roughly half of the area covered on glasses contain too noisy material and assert that additional QC ought to be conducted even on the material that could be microscopically inspected. After consulting QC, the material will be revisited."

So sample type: seems unspecified. It says "extracted prostate material" maybe from a surgery? It doesn't say biopsy, RP, TURP. So "NA".

Malignancy: The report says stromal tissue and carpet-like growth can be observed, but nuclei are dissolved and technical noise confounds assessment of cell differentiation patterns. It says too noisy, cannot assess. So likely no malignant tumor findings, or uncertain. But if we cannot determine, we might say "NA" or "no". The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')" If cannot determine, maybe "NA"? But the statement says cannot assess due to noise. So we can't say malignant or not. So "NA" probably.

Gleason: If benign or NA, we put "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to ensure no nested structures. Just fields. That seems appropriate.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
