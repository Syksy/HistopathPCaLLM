analysisWe need produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Determine sample type: For prostate histology, "RP" is radical prostatectomy, "biopsy" is biopsy, "TURP" transurethral resection. The text says: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." That indicates a prostate specimen, maybe from radical prostatectomy? It says "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g" likely refers to a prostate specimen removed (like RP). The sample type should be "RP". The malignancy: presence of malignant findings: yes, as they mention tumor growth, Gleason 5 and 4. So "kyllä". Gleason: "5+4=9" presumably because major is 5, minor is 4. But need ensure order: major+minor=sum. So "5+4=9". Should we include equals? The example uses "4+3=7". So we use "5+4=9". Provide JSON. Also no nested structure. Ensure fields order as specified? Provide as JSON.assistantfinal{
