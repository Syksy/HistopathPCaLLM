analysisWe need to process the statement. Determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali...". It is extracted prostate material, likely from a surgery? The phrase "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" likely from a TURP or RP? It says "3/5g always 8mm per piece, about half is pinned to histology". This might be a "TURP" or "RP" or "biopsy"? It is extracted material, maybe from transurethral resection (TURP). It says "tumors have disappeared" and "technical background noise hampers cell differentiation". No mention of adenocarcinoma or Gleason. So malignancy: "ei" (no malignancy). Gleason: "NA". Sample type: probably "TURP" or "NA" if uncertain. We need allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The text: "Ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali" indicates extracted prostate material. The context suggests maybe from TURP. Let's choose "TURP". Malignancy: "ei". Gleason: "NA". Output JSON accordingly.assistantfinal```json
