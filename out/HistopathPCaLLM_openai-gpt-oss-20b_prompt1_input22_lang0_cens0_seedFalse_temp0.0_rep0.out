analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "A container of prostate thick needle biopsies" => biopsy. Malignancy: left side fragments show carcinoma tissue structures. So malignant yes. Gleason grade: left side fragments exhibit mainly low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4. So we have two scores: 3 and 4. It says "mainly low grade... firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4." So likely the Gleason pattern 3 and 4. So major+minor = 4+3=7. The most severe lesion is the 4 pattern. So Gleason 4+3=7. So output JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check that no nested structures. Just those fields. Done.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
