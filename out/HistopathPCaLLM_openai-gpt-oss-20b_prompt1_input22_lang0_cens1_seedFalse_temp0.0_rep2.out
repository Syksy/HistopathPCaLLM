analysisWe need to parse the statement. It is a description: "A container of prostate tissue sampling material was inspected, with fragmentation to lengths 10 and 7mm in sample material originating from the left side and 15 and 10mm from the right side. Chronic inflammation can be seen systematically across the material. Fragments exhibit abnormally wide range of cell differentation types. Assigning a Gleason to the wide range of cell architectures proves to be exceptionally difficult, and proof-checking ought to be conducted that the material truly originates from prostate and the conservation of samples has not been contaminated by e.g. bacterial agent. As it is, the highly fragmented and varying samples from both sides cannot be assessed for malignancies and need to be reprocessed."

From this, we need to determine sample type: It says "prostate tissue sampling material" but no explicit sample type like biopsy, RP, TURP. So we should use "NA" maybe. But maybe we could interpret as biopsy? The statement says "container of prostate tissue sampling material". Could be from any type. But not specified. So "NA".

Malignancy: cannot be assessed, so "NA" or "no"? The instructions say: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")". Since we cannot assess, we should use "NA".

Gleason: cannot assess, so "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}

Double-check: The instruction says only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned. But there are no lesions. So NA.

Thus final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
