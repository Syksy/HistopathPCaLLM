analysisWe need to parse the statement. We have prostatectomy sample? "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed". So Sample type: "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+5=9"? But they say Gleason-score sum 9. Usually Gleason 4+5=9. So we output "4+5=9". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

We must ensure format: lower-case keys? Example uses "Sampletype" capital S, "Malignancy", "Gleason". Keep same. Provide as JSON string. No other fields. Provide only that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
