analysisWe need to output JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate are processed..." So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Actually sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "5+4=9"? Wait they mention "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." The text says: "Presents mainly differentation stage 4 (60%). The second most common stage 5 (approx 30% proportion)... Tertiary grade class 3". So major=5, minor=4? But they say stage 4 main, stage 5 second. Usually major grade is highest (5) and minor is next highest (4). So Gleason = "5+4=9". Or "4+5=9"? They asked "major+minor=sum". So major should be 5 (higher). So "5+4=9". So output JSON with that.

Also ensure only results from most severe lesion. The whole specimen is adenocarcinoma. So malignancy yes. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Check that "Malignancy" allowed "yes", "no" or "NA". So yes. Return exactly that JSON. No nested structures. Provide valid JSON with keys spelled as in example: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Ensure no trailing comma. So final.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
