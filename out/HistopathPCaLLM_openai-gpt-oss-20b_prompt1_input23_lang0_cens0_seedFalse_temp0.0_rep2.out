analysisWe need to produce structured data for the statement. The sample type: The statement says "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate". That indicates RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: "5+4=9" or "4+5=9"? The statement: "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." It doesn't specify major/minor, but typical major+minor sum 9 means something like 5+4 or 4+5. We can structure as "5+4=9" or "4+5=9". We need to provide "major+minor=sum" form. The statement says "Gleason-score sum 9". We need to decide. In the example, they used "4+3=7". So we should pick "5+4=9" as plausible. But we could also choose "4+5=9". Which is more common? Gleason score 5+4 is typical for 9. Let's go with "5+4=9".

Thus JSON: 
{
 "Sampletype":"RP",
 "Malignancy":"yes",
 "Gleason":"5+4=9"
}

Return only that.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
