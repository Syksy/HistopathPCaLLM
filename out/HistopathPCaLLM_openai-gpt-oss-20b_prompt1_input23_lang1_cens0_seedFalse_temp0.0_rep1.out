analysisWe need to parse statement. It's about prostatectomy preparation (tissue from prostatectomy). So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy? Yes, adenocarcinoma present. So "kyllä". Gleason: report "Gleason-pistesumma on 9". But earlier says: two main components: 4 (60%) and 5 (30%) and third 3. So major+minor sum 5+4=9. So Gleason "5+4=9". According to rule: for malignant, "major+minor=sum" with integers. So "5+4=9". So output JSON.

Also note: "käsittely: only worst lesion" - we pick highest Gleason, which is 5+4=9. So yes. Provide JSON.

assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
