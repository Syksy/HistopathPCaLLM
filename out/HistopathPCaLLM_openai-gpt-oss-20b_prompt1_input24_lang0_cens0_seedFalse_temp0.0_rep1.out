analysisWe need to parse the statement to produce JSON with fields:

- Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA".
- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign.

We need to consider only the most severe lesion. The sample type: "The sample consists of confirmatory set of approx. 10g of turp-chippings". So sample type is TURP. Malignancy: yes, because malignant suspicion, found adenocarcinoma. Gleason: reported as "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". But earlier "In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth." That suggests Gleason 4? Wait "classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth". That likely means Gleason 4 as the major grade? But typically Gleason score is composed of two numbers (major + minor). The later phrase "now resulting in sum 8 adenocarcinoma." That indicates Gleason sum 8, which would be major+minor=8. But we need to express as major+minor=sum. But we don't have breakdown. However we can just provide "8" or "NA"? The instruction: "reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we need "major+minor=sum". If we only have the sum 8, we can provide "8" maybe? But they want "major+minor=sum". Could we say "4+?=8"? But we don't know minor. Might just provide "8" or "NA"? The example uses "4+3=7". So we should provide "4+4=8"? But that would be a guess. The statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" which might be sum 8. It doesn't give major/minor. We might just say "8" as the sum. But the format is "major+minor=sum". Maybe we can provide "8" as sum, but not major/minor. But they said "preferably'major+minor=sum'". So we can provide "8" if we can't break down. Maybe "NA" not correct.

We need to interpret: "In over 50% of the chippings present melding of grandular acinus classified as Gleason 4 -class tumor growth." That might indicate Gleason pattern 4? That could mean major 4, minor unknown. But the final "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" might be the final grade. So the most severe lesion is the adenocarcinoma with Gleason sum 8. So we should include Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "8" or "NA"? I'd say "8" (just the sum). But could also be "4+4=8"? But that would be speculation. Better to provide "8" or "NA"? The instructions say "preferably'major+minor=sum'". If we only know sum, we could just provide "8". Example: "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." They included major+minor. Here we don't know major/minor. So maybe "8" is acceptable.

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"TURP",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"8"
}

But maybe we should put "8" as sum. Or "NA"? The instruction says for malignant statements, "reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum'... or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we must provide something if malignant. So "8" is fine. But the format is "major+minor=sum". However we can still provide "8" because it's the sum, but not following the format. But maybe we can provide "4+4=8" as an assumption. But that might be incorrect. There is no info about minor. I'd provide "8" as sum. But maybe better to adhere to "major+minor=sum" format: "8" is not that format. But the instruction says "preferably'major+minor=sum'". So we can provide "8" if we can't determine major/minor. That may still be acceptable.
