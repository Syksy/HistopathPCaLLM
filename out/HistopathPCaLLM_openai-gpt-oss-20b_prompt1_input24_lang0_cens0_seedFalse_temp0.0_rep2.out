analysisWe need to parse the statement. We have sample type: "turp-chippings" => sample type: TURP. Malignancy: yes (there is malignant suspicion, adenocarcinoma). Gleason: reported sum 8. In the statement: "sum 8 adenocarcinoma" implies Gleason 8. We should output "8" or "8" but the format expected is "major+minor=sum". But we only have sum. Usually they'd write "8" but maybe "8" is sum. But per instructions: allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign. If only sum known, maybe "8" is sum but no major/minor. But we can output "8". But the example uses "4+3=7". They want sum. They want sum. So we can output "8". But maybe better "8". There's no major/minor provided. So "8" is fine.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "8"
}

Check: sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "TURP".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "8"
}
```
