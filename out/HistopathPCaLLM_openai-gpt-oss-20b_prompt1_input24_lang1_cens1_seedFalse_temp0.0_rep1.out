analysisWe need to parse the statement and produce JSON with fields:

- Sampletype: one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
- Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei" or "NA".
- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA".

We need only the worst lesion results. Also structured result should not be nested.

We need to read the text: It's in Finnish. The passage describes samples from multiple sets of patients, biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TURP, after benign diagnosis. They looked at inter-observer variation, training material. About 1/4 of cases benign material rose in class to Gleason 3+3 or up to 3+4 due to imaging methods. Re-evaluation didn't raise to GG3 or higher. Summary: training material from multiple patients, reviewed by senior pathologist, leading to each case where rise e.g. Gleason 6. The purpose of training not to influence clinical decision making.

We need to answer for each case? But the instructions say "Apply the questions to the following statement." So we produce one JSON object for that statement. We need to interpret the sample type: It says "Näytteet koostuvat useammasta setistä potilaita, joiden biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä oli saatavilla". So samples include biopsies, radical prostatectomies, TURPs. Which one is sample type? The instruction: "Mikä on näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi" So we must choose one. The text refers to multiple types. Which is the original sample type? The text says the materials were "biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä". So sample type ambiguous. We may return "NA" because not specified? But maybe we choose "biopsy" as the most common? But the text says "useammasta setistä potilaita, joiden biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä oli saatavilla". There are multiple types. The question: "Mikä on näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi (sallitut arvot "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" tai "NA")". It seems we need to output the sample type of the sample in the statement. But since statement covers multiple sample types, we might choose "NA" because not a single type.

Malignancy: The passage is about benign material that sometimes rose to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, but not above GG3. Later, the final summary says: each case where rise e.g. Gleason 6. So the worst lesion reported is Gleason 6. But is that malignant? Yes Gleason 6 is considered low-grade carcinoma. So malignancy "kyllä".

Gleason: the worst reported is "6". But format requires "major+minor=sum" e.g., "3+3=6" or "3+4=7". The passage says "Gleason 6". But typical Gleason 6 is 3+3. So we can express as "3+3=6".

But also earlier says "3+4" possible. But worst is 6. So we output "3+3=6". But the text says "nousu esim. Gleason 6:een" which is ambiguous but likely 3+3.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

But we must ensure we only return worst lesion. Yes.

Let's produce that.assistantfinal```json
