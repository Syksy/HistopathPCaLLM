analysisWe need to parse the text. They mention "fresh prostatectomy specimen" but then say "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." So sample type: It says "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" but then "original sample is an autopsy sample". Which to choose? The structured field should be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. But here they say it's a fresh prostatectomy specimen. That likely means RP. But also mention autopsy sample. But sample type likely "RP". However, autopsy sample is not one of allowed values. So we choose "RP". Malignancy: no malignant tumor findings. So "no". Gleason: for benign statements, "NA". So output JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
