analysisWe need to parse the statement.

Sample type: The statement says "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen, with a total weight 44g." But then "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." There is confusion. The first line says "fresh prostatectomy specimen" - that's surgical removal. But then "original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Which is the sample type? Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". RP stands for radical prostatectomy. So "prostatectomy specimen" likely means RP. But also autopsy sample. But allowed values don't include autopsy. If it's autopsy, we might use NA. But we should choose the most specific. They say "fresh prostatectomy specimen" and "original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Might be contradictory. The sample type likely "RP" for radical prostatectomy. But mention autopsy, but allowed values do not include autopsy. I'd choose "RP".

Malignancy: Findings are benign. "Microscopically all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth. Some atrophy and spot-like inflammation is found, along with growth suggestive of hyperplasia." No malignant tumor. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: Since malignant negative, Gleason: "NA".
