analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen,... The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Wait, contradictory: fresh prostatectomy specimen vs autopsy sample? The statement says "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" then later "The original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." Maybe it's a composite. But we need to decide sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". RP stands for Radical Prostatectomy. So if it's a prostatectomy specimen, that is RP. Also autopsy sample? But allowed types only those four. Probably "RP". Malignancy? The text says "Microscopically all longitudinal macrosections from both the apex and basis present normal benign growth. Some atrophy and spot-like inflammation is found, along with growth suggestive of hyperplasia... The resection surfaces are clean, the capsule is showing no abnormal growth... Prostate tissue contains at most a low inflammatory state, and most of the tissue changes can be attributed to normal aging." So no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Provide structured JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Use allowed values. So answer:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Ensure no nested structures. Output only JSON.assistantfinal```json
