analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's an autopsy specimen for research. Sample type: "NA" because it's autopsy. Malignancy: The text says "cannot be reliably inferred... potentially adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes... but currently only marginally utilized". There is no definitive malignant finding. So "Malignancy": "no" or "NA"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")". Since no malignant tumor findings are reported, we should set "no". Gleason: Only if malignant. Since no malignant, set "NA". So JSON: { "Sampletype": "NA", "Malignancy": "no", "Gleason": "NA" }.assistantfinal```json

  "Gleason": "NA"
