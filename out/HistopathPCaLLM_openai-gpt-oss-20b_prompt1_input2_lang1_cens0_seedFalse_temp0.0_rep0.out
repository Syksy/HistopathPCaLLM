analysisWe need to produce JSON with the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Input: a statement describing a sample. We need to determine sample type: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The sample is a radical prostatectomy specimen. So sample type is "RP". Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA". The report says: In all macrosections and microsections, mainly normal tissue, with some atrophy, mild inflammation, hyperplasia-like changes. No malignant tumor noted. So malignancy is "ei". Gleason: For malignancies, report major+minor=sum. For benign, "NA". So since no malignancy, Gleason should be "NA". Output JSON. Ensure no nested structures. Provide exactly the JSON.assistantfinal{
