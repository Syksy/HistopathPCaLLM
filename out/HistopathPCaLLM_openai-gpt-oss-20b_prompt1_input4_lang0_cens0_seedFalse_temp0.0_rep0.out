analysisWe need to parse the statement. It describes samples 1-6 from prostate biopsies. Sample 3 is non-representative. The rest are representative and benign prostate tissue observed. No adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So malignant tumor findings: "no". Sample type: biopsy. Gleason: NA because no malignant. So output JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return only that. Ensure keys match exactly. The example uses capitalized field names: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
