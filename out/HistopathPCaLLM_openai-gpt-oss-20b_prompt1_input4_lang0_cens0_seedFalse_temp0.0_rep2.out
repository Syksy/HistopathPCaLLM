analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing samples 1 to 6 are biopsies. Sample 3 not representative. Others are representative and benign. No adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So malignant tumor findings? No. So Malignancy: "no". Sample type: biopsy. Gleason: "NA" because benign. They also say "no prostate tissue observed in sample 3". But we consider the most severe lesion from all samples: no malignancy. So answer: sampletype "biopsy", malignancy "no", gleason "NA". Output JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
