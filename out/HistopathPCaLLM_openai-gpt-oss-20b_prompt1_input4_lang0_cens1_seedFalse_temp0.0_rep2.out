analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Several sampling sites are available from standard locations. One sample part appears to be not representative, as it contains no prostate tissue. Otherwise the sampled tissue appears representative of prostate tissue. While no notable atypic patterns are present among the observed prostate tissue, the sample material is insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes."

We need to determine:

1. Sample type: The statement doesn't explicitly mention "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". It says "sampling sites" but not type. Likely "NA" or maybe "biopsy"? In many histopathology reports, "sampling sites" could be biopsy. But we can choose NA because not specified. The allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since not specified, use "NA".

2. Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement says no notable atypic patterns, sample material insufficient to assess presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So no malignant findings discovered. So Malignancy: "no".

3. Gleason: For benign statements: "NA". So Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON with those fields. Ensure no nested structures. Also "Malignancy" uses allowed values: "yes", "no", "NA". So "no". "Sampletype" allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "NA". "Gleason": "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
