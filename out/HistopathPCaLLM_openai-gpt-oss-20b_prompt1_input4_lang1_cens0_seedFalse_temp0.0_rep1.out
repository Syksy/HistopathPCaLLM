analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing sample 1-6 prostate biopsies. Sample 3 biopsies' cylinders not representative because no prostate tissue seen. Others are representative and show benign prostate tissue. No significant atypia. No carcinoma or PIN changes found.

Thus sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: ei (no malignancy). Gleason: NA because no malignancy. Note: we need to output the structure with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Should be JSON. The example uses keys with capitalized first letters: "Sampletype": "biopsy", "Malignancy": "kyllä", "Gleason": "4+3=7". So we must use same case. We have to ensure no nested structures. Just produce top-level object.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Just that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
