analysisWe need to extract sample type: "radical prostatectomy" -> "RP" presumably. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: the most severe lesion: Highest Gleason sum presumably 9 (4+5). The statement says macro B higher sum (9) architecture 4+5. So Gleason "4+5=9". Output JSON with keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Use allowed values: Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+5=9".assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
