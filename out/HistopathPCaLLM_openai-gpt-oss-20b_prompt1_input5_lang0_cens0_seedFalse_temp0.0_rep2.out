analysisWe need to produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Only the most severe lesion; we have macro B higher sum (9) architecture 4+5 sum of 9. The statement says macro B higher sum (9) observed of architecture 4+5. So Gleason is 4+5=9. Sampletype: radical prostatectomy => "RP". Malignancy: yes. So produce JSON.

Check formatting: keys capitalized? Example uses "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Use those. Provide JSON only.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
