analysisWe need to parse the statement: It's a prostate histopathology report. They mention sample specimen originates from a relatively enlarged prostate. Samplings from left processed with yellow dye etc. They say: Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings. Major and minor Gleason classes using a reasonable threshold such as above 50% could not be inferred. Different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection. Based on the patient's clinical report from the referral center, it would be likely that prostate capsule is intact and likely no perineural invasion has occurred either.

We need to return structured data: Sampletype (allowed: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA). This sample originates from a relatively enlargened prostate. It's unclear what type. They mention "sample specimen originates from a relatively enlargened prostate. Samplings from left processed with yellow dye etc." No explicit mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. Likely it's a biopsy? It says "samples taken from both apex and basis". That could be a biopsy. Since they did sampling, maybe a transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy. So sample type is "biopsy".

Malignancy: "Microscopically clear prostate tissue can be observed across all basis and apex samplings." They mention clear tissue, no malignancy. They also say Gleason classes could not be inferred. So malignant tumor findings: "no" or "NA"? They specifically mention no malignant findings. So "no".

Gleason: "NA" because benign.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But double-check: The statement says "different kind of architectures are observed between the main macros, and the suspected higher sum one is referred to colleague for further inspection." They suspect a higher sum but haven't determined. So we cannot provide a Gleason. So NA.

Thus final output.assistantfinal```json
