analysisWe need to produce JSON with keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype: allowed values biopsy, RP, TURP or NA. The text: "Näytekappale on alun perin...". It's a sample. This is not a biopsy, it's a sample from prostate tissue maybe from surgery? But the text says "Näytekappale on alun perin verrattain laajentuneesta prostatasta." Means it's a sample from a prostate. They processed left and right side sections. They mention apex and base. Likely it's part of a radical prostatectomy or TURP? But it's a sample, not biopsy. They didn't specify a procedure. So Sampletype: NA.

Malignancy: Did the sample have malignant findings? The text: "Suurempaa ja pienempää Gleason luokkaa ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään" They talk about not being able to determine Gleason. No mention of cancer. So Malignancy: ei (no malignant findings). But they mention "epäilty suurempi summa referoidaan kollegalle jatkotutkimuksia varten." That suggests suspicion but not confirmed. So we treat as no malignant. So Malignancy: ei.

Gleason: Since no malignancy, we put "NA". The guidelines: for malignant findings, we output "major+minor=sum". For benign, "NA". So output "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"ei","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json

  "Sampletype": "NA",

  "Gleason": "NA"
