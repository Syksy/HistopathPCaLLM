analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes. Microscopically relatively normal prostate grandular structures are observed, although a heavy burn artefact is present. Although glands are largely unobservable due to the artefacts, the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to determine sample type: from options "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The sample is shaving chips, run via three tissue casettes. Is that a biopsy? Shaving chips: maybe from a TURP or RP? Shaving chips are usually from TURP (Transurethral resection of prostate) or from a prostatectomy? Typically "shaving chips" from prostatectomy, but the phrase "shaving chips" often refers to TURP fragments. The statement says "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips". That could be from "RP" (Radical Prostatectomy) or TURP. But no mention of "resected" or "shave" from TURP. Let's interpret as "TURP" maybe. But the sample type might be "NA" because classification ambiguous? But we have to choose one allowed value. The sample is "shaving chips" likely from TURP. So I'll set Sampletype: "TURP".

Malignancy: It says findings hint at benign prostate hyperplasia. So malignant tumor findings: no. So "no".

Gleason grade: benign, so "NA".
