analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. For this statement: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes. Microscopically relatively normal prostate grandular structures are observed, although a heavy burn artefact is present. Although glands are largely unobservable due to the artefacts, the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia."

First, original sample type: "shaving chips" indicates "RP"? Actually "shaving chips" is a type of sample used in radical prostatectomy. The sample type for RP is typically "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The statement says "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes". That's from radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: It's benign. So "no".

Gleason: benign, so "NA".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
