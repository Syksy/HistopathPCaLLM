analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes. Microscopically relatively normal prostate grandular structures are observed, although a heavy burn artefact is present. Although glands are largely unobservable due to the artefacts, the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason. Sample type: "shaving chips" likely from TURP (Transurethral resection of prostate). They mention shaving chips run via tissue casettes. Shaving chips are typical of TURP tissue, not biopsy or RP. So sample type: "TURP".

Malignancy: benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) – so no malignant tumor findings. So "no".

Gleason: benign so "NA".

Return JSON as specified.

Also note: "original sample type allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP or NA". So TURP.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype":"TURP",
 "Malignancy":"no",
 "Gleason":"NA"
}

Ensure valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
