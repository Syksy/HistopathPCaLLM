analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about samples from operation material. It says "Samples consist of very fragmented parts of the original prostatic operation material." So sample type? Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "Prostatic operation material" likely means Radical Prostatectomy (RP). So sample type: "RP". Malignancy? Statement: "relatively normal prostate tissue structures are observed, but majority cannot be inspected due to burn artefact. Results inconclusive." No malignant tumor findings are mentioned. So Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The statement says inconclusive, but no mention of malignant or benign. The instruction: For benign statements, Gleason "NA". For malignant, provide "major+minor=sum". For benign, Malignancy "no" or "NA"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If inconclusive, maybe "NA". But we should interpret: no malignant tumor findings. So "no". But is that allowed? Yes. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Provide JSON. Ensure no nested structures. Also "the following statement" only one. So final JSON.assistantfinal```json
