analysisWe need to parse statement. It's about samples from original prostatic operation material. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: "NA" because inconclusive, not malignant. Gleason: "NA". So JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure no nested structures. Provide exactly that.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
