analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies with a total length approx. 150mm. In sample 1B from the right side of basis, a focus with small grandular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, the finding is so small that the conclusions remain on the suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. Rest of the samples exhibit only ordinary grandular structures."

Thus it's about prostate biopsies. So Sampletype = "biopsy". Malignancy: "NA" or "no"? They say suspicion-level, not conclusive. They say clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. So "NA" maybe. But allowed values: "yes", "no", "NA". If not conclusive, use "NA". Therefore Malignancy: "NA". Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON with those fields.

Ensure no nested structures. Provide keys exactly as specified: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

That's it.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
