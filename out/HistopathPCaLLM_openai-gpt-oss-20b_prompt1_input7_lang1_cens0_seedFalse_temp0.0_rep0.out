analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. According to instructions: only report worst lesion results. The sample is "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsiat" meaning a prostate biopsy. The report says: In sample 1B, a focus appears with small glandular structures, tumor-typical and morphological could correspond to adenocarcinoma. The finding is so minor that it remains at suspicion level, no clear adenocarcinoma found. In other samples only normal tissue. So there is no malignancy found. So Malignancy: "ei" (no). Gleason: "NA" (since no malignancy). Sampletype: "biopsy". Output JSON accordingly. Ensure JSON format exactly as example. No nested structures. Use proper Finnish strings. Provide JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
