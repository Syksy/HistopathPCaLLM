analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples 1 and 2 contain lymph nodes (3 pcs each), with lengths spanning 1 to 3 cm. Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate, which is run according to the routine protocol. In the third sample tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties and forming fusing and separately growing grandular structures. The findings cover approx 10% of the section area. Additionally, aggregates of macrophages are observed and high grade inflammatory changes. Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with the lower grade 3 consisting of approx 30%. High grade PIN-changes are also observed. The inspected lymph nodes are free from malignant findings (0/6)."

We must produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The sample type: The statement references Sample 3 is a radical prostatectomy preparate. So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The malignant tumor findings: Yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". Only most severe lesion. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". So "RP". Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7". That is correct. Output in JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
