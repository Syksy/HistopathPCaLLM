analysisWe need to parse the statement.

We are told to return only the most severe lesion structured data. The statement contains multiple samples: Samples 1 and 2 are lymph nodes with no malignant findings. Sample 3 is radical prostatectomy. It contains tumor tissue with invasive properties, covering about 10% of the section area. Highest Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with lower grade 3 comprising approx 30%. High grade PIN changes also observed. But the malignant tumor is present in the prostatectomy sample. So we should provide the data for the most severe lesion. The malignant tumor in the radical prostatectomy is the most severe (lymph nodes are benign). So we use sample type "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Yes.

Malignancy "yes" or "no" or "NA". Yes "yes".

Gleason "major+minor=sum" whole numbers for malignant statements. Yes "4+3=7".

Return valid JSON.

We should not include nested structures. Just those three fields.
