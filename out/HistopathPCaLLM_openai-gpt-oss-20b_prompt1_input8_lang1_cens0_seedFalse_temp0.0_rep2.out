analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. For the given sentence, we have multiple samples: samples 1 and 2 are lymph nodes, sample 3 is radical prostatectomy. The instruction says only return the worst lesion results. So we should pick the worst lesion from all samples. Sample 3 has carcinoma with Gleason 4+3=7, malignant. Sample 1 and 2 have no malignancy. So the worst lesion is sample 3. So Sampletype: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: "kyllä". Gleason: "4+3=7". Return JSON as specified. Ensure no nested structure. Use quotes. The example uses double quotes. So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

We must not include other keys. The instruction also says only return data for the worst lesion. So that's it.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
