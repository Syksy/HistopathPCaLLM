analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing a sample: "A total 20g of electrosection shavings were obtained as the sample material." So sample type - it's "electrosection shavings" presumably from TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) or maybe "electrosection" is from TURP. But allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "Electrosection shavings" likely from TURP. So sample type: "TURP". Malignancy: "no" since no malignant findings. Gleason: "NA" because no malignant. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if any nuance: The text says "No malignant findings are observed". So "Malignancy": "no". Good. Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
