analysisWe need to produce structured JSON with fields:
- Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
- Malignancy: "yes", "no", "NA".
- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA" for benign.

We have statement: "A total 20g of electrosection shavings were obtained as the sample material. 10g sample material is then processed, leaving the other half of the sample material unused. A total of 8 casettes were utilized in the runs. Histologically a large quantity of prostate stromal tissue is observed. Epithelial cell lining appears to dual layered. Parts of the grandular structures appear enlarged, which fit hyperplasia. No malignant findings are observed, thus the findings fits the expected benign hyperplasia."

This describes "electrosection shavings". That likely refers to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) or maybe a TURP sample? Electrosection shavings are from TURP. So Sampletype: "TURP". Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". We'll output JSON accordingly. Ensure no nested structures, simple object. Should we use "NA" for sample type? But we can interpret as TURP. The statement: "electrosection shavings" indicates TURP. So fill "TURP". The statement explicitly says "No malignant findings". So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA".

Return:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

That's it.assistantfinal```json
