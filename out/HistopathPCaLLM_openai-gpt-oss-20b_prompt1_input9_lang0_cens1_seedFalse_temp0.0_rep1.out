analysisWe need to parse the statement to extract: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement describes a sample: "A few dozen grams total of sample material was obtained, of which roughly half was then processed." It does not specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It's likely "NA". There's no mention of malignant tumor findings. It says "the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal. Parts of the granul...could be attributed to technical difficulties...Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn from currently examined material, and a faulty processing...". So malignant? No. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Return JSON.

We must not include nested structures. So output:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype: "biopsy","RP","TURP","NA". Malignancy: "yes","no","NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Good.

Thus output that JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
