analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing histological examination: benign prostate tissue, no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. So malignant tumor findings = no. Sample type: unclear. It says "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks." This likely refers to a radical prostatectomy? Or "Chipping" could be prostate tissue obtained via biopsy? The context: "Chipping samples" suggests a prostatectomy sample. But we need to determine sample type among allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement does not explicitly state "biopsy" or "RP" or "TURP". It says "Chipping samples". Could be from a prostatectomy. Possibly "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. Since it's tissue from chipping, likely from a surgical specimen. But the safe choice is "NA" if ambiguous. The instructions: "What is the original sample type (allowed values: 'biopsy', 'RP', 'TURP' or 'NA')." If cannot determine, use NA. So sample type = NA. Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA. Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
