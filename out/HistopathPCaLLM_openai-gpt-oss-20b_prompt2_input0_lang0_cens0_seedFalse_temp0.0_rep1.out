analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g, of which 20g were started in six blocks. In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. The finding thus fits the suspected benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to determine sample type: The statement refers to "Chipping samples" presumably from a prostate. But the sample type options are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "Chipping" is not one of them. It's likely a core biopsy or something but they say "some spot-like inflammation" and "benign prostate hyperplasia." The text says "In histological examination benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma." So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA" because benign.

Sample type: The text doesn't specify "biopsy" etc. "Chipping samples totaled approx 30g" - maybe it refers to a core biopsy or a TURP? It's not clear. Since no explicit mention, we use "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check the instruction: only results from the most severe lesion should be returned. Here there's no malignant lesion, so "no" and "NA". They said not nested.
