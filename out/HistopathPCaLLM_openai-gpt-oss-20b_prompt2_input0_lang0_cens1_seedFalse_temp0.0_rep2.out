analysisWe have a statement: "A lot sample material was obtained, which were run in multiple batches. In histological examination prostate tissue was observed, but any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted. Some spot-like inflammation can be observed. From this material reliable conclusions cannot be drawn regarding whether the findings fit the suspicion of benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to parse. Sample type: The statement says "A lot sample material was obtained" - no specific type like biopsy, RP, TURP. So Sampletype: "NA".

Malignancy: It explicitly says cannot infer malignancy or carcinoma. So Malignancy: "NA" (since not determined). Actually allowed values "yes", "no", "NA". Since no conclusion, NA.

Gleason: Since no malignant, so "NA".

Thus final JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
