analysisWe need to parse the given statement. Sample type: "biopsy" because "prostate systematic biopsies". Malignancy? The conclusion: "Suspicion-level finding from biopsies, but the diagnosis is uncertain although leaning towards benign." So malignant tumor findings are uncertain, leaning benign. We should set Malignancy to "NA"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If uncertain, likely "NA". Gleason: Not applicable (benign). So "NA". Provide JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check: They want only the most severe lesion. There's no malignant lesion. So "NA". Ensure keys exactly spelled as in example: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Return JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
