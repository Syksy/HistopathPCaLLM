analysisWe need to parse the statement. They ask: 1. What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). 2. Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA"). 3. What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably "major+minor=sum" in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements). We need to return only the most severe lesion. But here, the statement says: "Requested prostate samples arrived... normal basal cells observed... suspicious formations that hinted at stainings failing... conclusion: Suspicion of the staining immunopanel of prostate tissue failing in some of the samples, although most of the material appeared to exhibit expected patterns." No mention of malignant tumor findings, no Gleason grade. So we respond with NA for sample type? Actually sample type: It's not specified explicitly. It says "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches" but doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. So sample type is NA. Malignancy: no malignant findings, so "no"? But instructions say: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")." If no malignant tumor findings, we return "no". Gleason: NA. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if "no" is correct or "NA"? It says "were there malignant tumor findings." If none, we say "no". Good. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json

  "Sampletype": "NA",

  "Gleason": "NA"
