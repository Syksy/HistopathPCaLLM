analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement describes prostate samples, but no mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. It's a description of samples arrival, examination, normal basal cells observed, immunological staining. Suspicious formations, but no malignant tumor findings. So sample type? It says "Requested prostate samples arrived in 8 separate batches" - it's not a biopsy, not RP, not TURP. So sample type is NA. Malignancy: no malignant tumor findings, so "no". Gleason: NA. So final JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

But careful: instructions say: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." We have no malignant lesion. So "no" is correct. sample type: "NA". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
