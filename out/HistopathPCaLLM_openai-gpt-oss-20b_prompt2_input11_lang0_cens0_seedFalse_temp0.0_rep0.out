analysisWe need to produce JSON structured data: Sampletype: what is original sample type? The statement: "Prostatectomy preparate was run..." So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". Should we include sum? They want "major+minor=sum" in form of whole numbers for malignant statements. So "4+3=7". The format: {"Sampletype":"RP","Malignancy":"yes","Gleason":"4+3=7"}.

Ensure valid JSON. Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
