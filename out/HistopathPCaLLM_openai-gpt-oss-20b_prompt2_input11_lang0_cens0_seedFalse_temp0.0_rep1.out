analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement. We need to output JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype: Allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The sample is a prostatectomy prepa. That is radical prostatectomy, abbreviated RP. So Sampletype "RP".

Malignancy: yes if malignant tumor findings. There is "Microscopically invasive tumor tissue is observed" etc. So yes.

Gleason: We have "Gleason grading 4+3". So "4+3=7".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check formatting. JSON. Ensure keys exactly spelled. Use camel case? Provided example uses "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason" with capital first letter. So match. Ensure no trailing commas. Provide final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
