analysisWe need to parse the statement and extract: sample type, malignancy, Gleason. Allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "Prostatectomy preparate" => this is a radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes, since tumor tissue observed. So "yes".

Gleason: reported as "4+3". The statement says "Gleason grading 4+3". We need "major+minor=sum" format. 4+3 sum is 7. So "4+3=7".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check formatting: keys capitalized exactly as example: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Ensure proper JSON.

Return only JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
