analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The obtained sample consist of electrosection shavings from the prostate and have been started in eight blocks. In histological examination, majority of the sample material exhibits normal prostate tissue like architecture, thus the material is classified as benign."

We need to determine: Sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The sample is "electrosection shavings from the prostate". That sounds like a radical prostatectomy? Electrosection shavings could be from a TURP or from prostatectomy? Electrosection is a surgical technique used in TURP (transurethral resection of prostate). So sample type likely TURP. But is "electrosection shavings" typical of TURP? Yes, TURP uses resectoscope and electric loop to shave tissue. So sample type: "TURP".

Malignancy: the statement says majority normal, classified as benign. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: benign, thus "NA".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to ensure it's valid JSON. Format exactly.

Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
