analysisWe need to parse the given statement. It says: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue." We need to decide sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement does not specify biopsy or RP etc. It says "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue" but no specific type. So likely NA. Malignancy: "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but there's no definitive malignant finding. So probably NA. Gleason: no grade provided. So NA. So all NA. So JSON: { "Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
