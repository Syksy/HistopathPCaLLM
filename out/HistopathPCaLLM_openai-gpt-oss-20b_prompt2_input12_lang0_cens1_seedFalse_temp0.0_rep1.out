analysisWe need to parse the statement. Let's read: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue."

We need to determine sample type: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue" but does not specify biopsy, radical prostatectomy, TURP. It says "started in eight batches". It doesn't mention specific procedure. Likely NA.

Malignancy: yes/no/NA. Does it indicate malignant tumor findings? The statement: "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but no malignancy confirmed. So maybe no. But it doesn't confirm malignant. So likely NA? Let's see instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." So if no malignant tumor findings reported, we set "no". If uncertain, maybe NA. The statement says "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but no confirmation. So likely "no" or "NA"? The structured example: For benign statements, Gleason "NA". For malignant, Gleason "major+minor=sum". If we don't have a malignancy finding, we should set "no" for Malignancy? The sample might be benign or uncertain. The instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". But we don't have any lesion described. So probably it's not a valid histopathological statement. The example of invalid statement had no malignancy. They set all "NA". So maybe we should set all NA.

Thus:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But let's consider if "suspected prostate cancer tissue" counts as malignant? The phrase "suspected prostate cancer tissue" is suspicion but not confirmed. So I'd treat as not confirmed. So "no" or "NA". The instruction "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned" - but there is no lesion.

Thus output NA for all.
