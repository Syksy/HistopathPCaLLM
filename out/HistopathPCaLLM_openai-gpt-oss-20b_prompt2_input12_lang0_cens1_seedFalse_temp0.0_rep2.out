analysisWe need to analyze the given statement: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue."

We need to decide if it's a valid histopathological statement. The guidelines: Provide structured data from free format text. The statements are prostate cancer histopathological statements. The algorithm should parse sample type, malignancy, Gleason. Only the most severe lesion should be returned, and structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Allowed values: Sampletype: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" like "4+3=7" for malignant statements or "NA" for benign statements.

The example: "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." -> sampletype biopsy, malignancy yes, gleason 4+3=7.

The non-example: "fatty 100 that tumour led no 37 previous atypical 153 pt3a cores maximum malignancy. 8mm aggressive 60 11mm group value 257 invasion from lot 38mm latest both it moderate gleason. Deposit before total focus included 12mm however, 10 gland distance 20 length active tumor prior underwent 80 clear 18, but relatively adipose 95 undergone 95 second 18mm dominant could contour residual glands 4+3 gg.

So we must determine if the given statement is a valid histopathological statement. The statement: "The obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue and has been started in eight batches. In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue."

We need to parse sample type: It says "obtained sample consists of suspected prostate cancer tissue". No mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. "has been started in eight batches" might indicate a core or something. Not sure. There is no explicit mention of sample type. So sample type likely NA.

Malignancy: It says "suspected prostate cancer tissue" but not confirmed. "In histological examination, majority of the sample material appeared to at least originate from the prostate, but high resolution images are currently in the digipathology queue." So no definitive malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy likely NA or no? The guidelines: For malignant statements, provide "yes". For benign, "no". For uncertain, "NA". The statement seems uncertain; we don't have evidence of malignancy. So Malignancy NA.

Gleason: Not provided, so NA.

Therefore the structured data likely: Sampletype: "NA", Malignancy: "NA", Gleason: "NA".

We need to confirm if the statement qualifies as a valid histopathological statement. The statement doesn't provide any definitive pathology, it's just describing a sample. It's not a result. So it is not a valid histopathological statement; thus we should output all NA.

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Let's output that.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
