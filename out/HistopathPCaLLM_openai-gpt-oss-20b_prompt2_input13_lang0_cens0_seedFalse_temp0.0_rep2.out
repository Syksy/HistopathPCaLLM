analysisWe need to parse the statement. Identify sample type: "prostate needle biopsies" => biopsy. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+5=9" (since they say total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)). So output JSON: Sampletype "biopsy", Malignancy "yes", Gleason "4+5=9".

Check: They mention carcinoma observed in sample B with Gleason score 5 and total Gleason stage 9 (4+5). So the most severe lesion: carcinoma with Gleason 4+5=9. So output that.

Return JSON exactly as described. Ensure no nested structures. Use correct field names: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide lowercase? The example used capitalized keys: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". We'll follow that.

Return only JSON.assistantfinal{
