analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate..." That suggests radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes, since tumor observed.

Gleason: "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. Gleason 7 is 3+4 or 4+3? They say larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. So the major pattern is 3. Minor pattern presumably 4. So Gleason 3+4 = 7. Usually major+minor sum. So "3+4=7". Alternatively they could have 4+3? But bigger is 3. So major 3, minor 4 sum 7. So we should output "3+4=7". Let's produce JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
