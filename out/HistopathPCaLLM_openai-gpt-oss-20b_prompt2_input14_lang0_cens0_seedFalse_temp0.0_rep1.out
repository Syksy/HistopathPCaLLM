analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a prostatectomy specimen (radical prostatectomy). So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes, tumor growth observed. Gleason: "7-stage carcinoma" presumably Gleason 7. Since they mention larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. In Gleason, usually two numbers: major and minor. But here they say Gleason 7-stage carcinoma, with larger portion of score 3 approx 60%. So likely Gleason 3+4=7 (major is 4). So we output "3+4=7" or "4+3=7"? The format is "major+minor=sum". Usually major is higher number. So major=4, minor=3 => 4+3=7. So "4+3=7". That seems correct. We need to return JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Thus:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check: The statement also mentions "tumor growth reaching near capsule border, no breach, no positive margins." So it's malignant. Yes. So output.

Note: The instruction says: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned" - we have only one lesion. So that's the only one.

Thus JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
