analysisWe need to parse the statement, extract sample type: "The specimen consist of a prostatetectomy preparate" That likely refers to RP (radical prostatectomy). Sample type allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So sample type = "RP".

Malignancy: yes (tumorous growth observed, carcinoma). So "yes".

Gleason: "Gleason 7-stage carcinoma" with larger portion 3 approx 60%. That implies major 4, minor 3? Wait Gleason 7 can be 3+4 or 4+3. The statement says "larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". That means the majority is 3. So likely 3+4=7? But they said "larger portion of score 3 approx 60%". So 3 is major. So major=3, minor=4 sum=7. So "3+4=7".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check formatting. JSON with keys exactly as specified. Use double quotes.assistantfinal```json
