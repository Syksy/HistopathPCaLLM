analysisWe need to parse the statement and determine: sample type, malignancy, Gleason. The statement describes a specimen, but does not mention malignant tumor findings. It mentions "special patterns of cell growth" but no mention of malignant tumor, no Gleason score. The sample type? It says "The specimen consists of a comprehensive overview of the patient's prostate tissue, prepared to be run on casettes following the normal routine." It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It seems it's a specimen for routine histology, maybe from prostatectomy? But it's not clear. No mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. So Sampletype: "NA". Malignancy: "NA" because not stated. Gleason: "NA". So JSON with all NA. That matches the instruction: only use NA if not valid histopathological statement. So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Yes.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
