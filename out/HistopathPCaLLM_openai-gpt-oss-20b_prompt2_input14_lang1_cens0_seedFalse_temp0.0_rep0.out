analysisWe need to extract from the given statement the three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We need to decide sample type: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. The text says "Tutkittavaksi tullut prostatektomia-preparaatti" which is a prostatectomy sample. So sample type = "RP".

Malignancy: yes if malignant findings. They mention "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" - yes malignant. So "kyllä".

Gleason: Should be "major+minor=sum" format. They say "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa". But they didn't give major/minor explicitly. "Gleason 7" could be 3+4 or 4+3, but not specified. The given field requires major+minor=sum. Since not specified, maybe cannot construct? The instructions say for malignant findings must provide Gleason as "major+minor=sum" with whole numbers, and for benign "NA". But if not specified, we can't guess. The sample text says "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3" maybe meaning the larger portion has score 3, so likely major 4 minor 3. But not absolutely certain. We might interpret as 4+3=7. In earlier example, they used "4+3=7". So we might return "4+3=7". But we must be cautious. The instruction: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot'major+minor=sum' muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja 'NA' hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." It says "raportoitu Gleason-luokka". In the statement, they report "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa". That's a reported Gleason grade. They didn't specify major/minor. But we can still output "7" or "7"? The format requires major+minor=sum. The example earlier uses "4+3=7". So we must adapt. If we cannot deduce major/minor, maybe we should output "NA"? But that would be wrong because it's malignant. But the instructions say "pahanlaatuisille löydöksille" must be "major+minor=sum". We might consider that the statement doesn't give major/minor, but still it's a malignant finding. The requirement might be to output NA if we cannot parse, but the instructions didn't mention that. It says "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot'major+minor=sum' muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja 'NA' hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if it's malignant, we need to output a Gleason in that format. Since we cannot deduce, we might treat as ambiguous and output "NA"? But that's contradictory to malignant. But the earlier example said "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa" and they didn't provide major/minor. They might accept "7"?? But format requires major+minor=sum. Might be "7+0=7"? But that doesn't make sense. The example didn't show such case. The safest is to output "4+3=7" because "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3" meaning the larger part is score 3. So the rest (other part) would be 4. So 4+3=7. So output that.

Alternatively, we could output "7" as sum. But they want major+minor. I'll go with "4+3=7". Provide JSON.

Also sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Good.

Return:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check no nested. That's it.assistantfinal{
