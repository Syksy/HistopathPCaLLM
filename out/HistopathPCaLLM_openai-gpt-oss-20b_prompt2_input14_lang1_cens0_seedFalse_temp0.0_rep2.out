analysisWe need produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", "NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Provide results for worst lesion.

We have statement: "Tutkittavaksi tullut prostatektomia-preparaatti,... Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä."

This is a prostatectomy (radical prostatectomy) specimen. So Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: yes (kyllä). Gleason: they report Gleason 7. They mention major+minor? They say "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." So the overall Gleason is 7. Typically 4+3=7? But they didn't specify major/minor. They only gave overall 7. But the required format is "major+minor=sum". We need to give major+minor. Since we don't know, but they mention "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." That suggests 3 is minor? But we need major+minor. Usually Gleason 7 could be 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. They said isompi osuus scoorauksella 3? Wait phrase: "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." Might be "isompi osuus scoorauksella 3"? That is ambiguous. But they say "jossa isompi osuus scoorauksella 3" maybe meaning the dominant pattern is grade 3? However typical pattern 3 is minor, 4 is major. But they say "isompi osuus" meaning major portion is pattern 3? That would be 3+4? But that yields 7 as well. Since we cannot deduce, but we need to output something. Since they didn't specify, we could output "NA" but guidelines say for malignancy we need major+minor. But if not clear, maybe we set "NA". But instruction: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if malignancy yes, we should output a Gleason string. They provided "Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa." That is sum 7, but not breakdown. But we can still produce "7" or we can produce "NA"? The instruction says "major+minor=sum" format. We could output "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". But is that allowed? They didn't give major/minor explicitly. But we could guess. However better to output "NA" if cannot infer. But maybe acceptable to output "7"? But format requires "major+minor=sum". Could output "NA" to indicate not specified. But guidelines: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So if malignancy yes but we don't have breakdown, maybe "NA" is acceptable? But they say "raportoitu Gleason-luokka" meaning reported. They reported 7. But that is sum. But format expects breakdown. But maybe we still can output "7"? This is ambiguous.

Let's examine example: They had "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." They output "4+3=7". So they used breakdown. So if we have breakdown, we output that. If not, maybe "NA". But the instruction: "sallitut arvot "major+minor=sum" muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja "NA" hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille." So for malignant, only allowed values are "major+minor=sum". So "NA" only for benign. So we must output breakdown. If we can't determine, maybe still need to output something. But we can't produce "NA" because it's malignant. So we could guess typical pattern: 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. But they say "isompi osuus" (major part) scoorauksella 3 ~ 60% of findings. That indicates major is 3? That would be weird because 3 is lower grade. But if major part is 3, minor is 4? That would be 3+4=7. So we can output "3+4=7". That seems plausible.

Thus produce:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check: They said "Löydetyt tuumorit Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, josta isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60% löydöksissä." So major = 3, minor = 4. Good.

Let's produce JSON.assistantfinal```json

  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
