analysisWe need to parse the statement.

"Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed. Patient has been considered suspect before due to elevation of PSA. Scopic inspection through the shavings does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material, with the Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. The finding therefore confirms the earlier suspicion."

We need Sampletype: allowed values biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. "Prostate chippings" likely from a biopsy? It says chippings. Could be a biopsy. Usually chippings from biopsy. So sample type "biopsy".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: reported Gleason grade: "4+?=8"? Actually says Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. Usually Gleason 4+4=8 maybe? But maybe it's just sum 8. Should present as "4+4=8" or "4+?=8". The prompt says "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements. So we need major and minor. They say Gleason 4 being most represented along with its variants, leading to a sum of 8. This implies major 4, minor 4, sum 8. So "4+4=8". Provide that.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check for any ambiguous. The statement says "Gleason 4 being the most represented along with its variants". That might mean major 4, minor 4. So yes.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
