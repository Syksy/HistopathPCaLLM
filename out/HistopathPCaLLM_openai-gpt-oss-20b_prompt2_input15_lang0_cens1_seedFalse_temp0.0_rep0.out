analysisWe need to return structured data: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement is about prostate tissue material, not biopsy, RP, TURP. It says tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material. It doesn't specify sample type. So maybe "NA".

Malignancy: no histopathology yet, only clinical suspicion. So "NA".

Gleason: cannot be determined. So "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
