analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing prostate tissue material, but says "representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time". No malignant findings reported. It's uncertain. So we must output Sampletype: NA? The sample type is not specified: it says "Prostate tissue material totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material, all of which have been processed." No biopsy, RP, TURP indicated. So Sampletype NA.

Malignancy: no malignant tumor findings reported, but suspicion not confirmed. We should answer "NA" or "no"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since it's not determined, probably "NA". Because no findings reported.

Gleason: since none, "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure JSON keys exactly as specified: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Provide output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
