analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text. Determine sample type: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." Means tissue from prostate. "5g edestä" maybe "5g from endoscopic??" Let's read: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." Suggests a prostate resection? Could be "radical prostatectomy" (RP) or "biopsy". They mention "skoopilla" (endoscopy) showing adenocarcinoma. The sample type likely "RP" because they examined entire specimen? It says "edestä" maybe "from the prostate" but sample weight 5g. Could be a prostatectomy sample. "edestä" means "from the...". "5g" is small. Maybe it's a TURP sample. But they say "potilas ollut suspekti aiemmin... Skoopilla katsoen lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa". Might be a biopsy? "Skoopilla" indicates endoscopic exam. "Löydös" means "finding". The sample type: It's likely "biopsy" because they looked at multiple biopsies. But "5g" weight is bigger than typical biopsy. But could be a TURP specimen weight. However, TURP usually small pieces. 5g is plausible. They say "joista kaikki käyty läpi" all examined. They didn't mention "radical prostatectomy". So choose "RP"? But the instructions: allowed sample types "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". We need to decide best.

Given the context: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." That could be a TURP specimen (since 5g). "Höylälastuja" is "suspicious lesions". "joista kaikki käyty läpi" all examined. In TURP they would get tissue.

But "Skoopilla katsoen lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa," indicates that on endoscopy, nearly all show adenocarcinoma. So maybe they did a biopsy.

However, "5g edestä" - "edestä" could be "from the endoscopic procedure"? I'm leaning that it's "TURP".

But the sample type might also be "biopsy" if the weight is not the entire prostate but a piece. But 5g is bigger than typical needle biopsy (~0.5g). But a prostate biopsy sample can be 5g? Usually a core is ~0.5g. So 5g may be for TURP.

Thus sample type: "TURP".

Malignancy: yes, adenocarcinoma present. So "kyllä".

Gleason: "4+?=8". They said "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" (representative Gleason 4) and "pistesumma 8". So Gleason sum 8. They didn't mention minor pattern. Could be 4+4=8? But "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" might mean minor pattern 4, major 4? Actually "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" could mean most common pattern is 4. But they say "pistesumma 8". So we can represent Gleason as "4+4=8" or "4+?=8". The format requires "major+minor=sum". If we don't know minor, we can guess 4+4=8. That matches sum 8. So we return "4+4=8".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check spec: Allowed values: "major+minor=sum" form integers for malignant. So yes.

Return.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
