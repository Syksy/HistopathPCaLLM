analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's Finnish. We need to output JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We need to determine sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". The statement: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." This sounds like a prostatectomy sample? Actually "5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja" maybe "5g of tissue from prostate, all examined." Could be "biopsy" or "RP"? The phrase "hoyla" might be "biopsy" (sampel?). "hoyla" is "biopsy" in Finnish? The phrase "hoyla" might refer to "biopsy" or "tissue sample". "prostatann" etc. "Katsottavaksi" suggests that the sample has been examined. This could be a "biopsy" from a prostate. But the statement: "5g" of tissue, all examined. Could be "biopsy" or "RP" but "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. Usually tissue weight 5g could be from a biopsy? But biopsy usually smaller. 5g is typical for a prostatectomy specimen. But the sentence: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja, joista kaikki käyty läpi." The phrase "hoyla" is "biopsy"? "höylä" might be "biopsy" (?), but "hoyla" isn't typical. Let's read: "Katsottavaksi tullut yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja" maybe "5g of prostate biopsy tissue"? Actually "hoyla" means "biopsy" indeed. "Prostatat höylälastuja" maybe "prostate core samples" (biopsy cores). So likely "biopsy". So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: "Skoopilla katsoen lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa". So malignancy yes. So "kyllä".

Gleason: "edustavin Gleason 4:ää... piste summa 8." So "4+4=8"? But the text says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää... piste summa 8." It says "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" meaning the representative Gleason grade is 4? But typical Gleason grade includes two components: major and minor. They mention "piste summa 8." So maybe the Gleason score is 4+4=8? But they didn't mention minor grade explicitly, but "piste summa 8" indicates sum 8. Could be 4+4. We need to output in "major+minor=sum" format. So "4+4=8". They didn't mention minor grade, but we can assume both are 4. So output Gleason: "4+4=8".

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"biopsy",
"Malignancy":"kyllä",
"Gleason":"4+4=8"
}

Check if any conflicting. The text: "edustavin Gleason 4:ää" might mean the dominant Gleason grade is 4. The other component could be 4. So 4+4. So yes.

Return JSON.
