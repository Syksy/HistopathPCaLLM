analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "fusion biopsies" -> allowed sample type values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". "Fusion biopsy" is a type of biopsy. So sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: We need to report the most severe lesion: It says Gleason 3 main, some Gleason 4 in less than one third. They say "score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3". So highest architecture 4. So Gleason major 4 minor 3 sum 7. So "4+3=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

We should ensure we follow allowed values: sampletype "biopsy". Malignancy "yes". Gleason "4+3=7".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
