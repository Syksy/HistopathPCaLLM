analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate. They mention carcinoma focuses, lengths 7, 6, and 2 mm. They say "mainly level 3 grade growth, although some Gleason 4 -type of looping structures are observed spanning less than one third of the carcinoma length." Conclusion: score 7 comes from 15mm length, with architecture 3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of the carcinoma part.

So sample type: "biopsy" (since fusion biopsies). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 3+4=7 (score 7). The structure: "3 covering approx 2/3 and architecture 4 approx 1/3 of carcinoma part" indicates Gleason pattern 3 and 4. So "3+4=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check that no other malignant statements. The statement indicates carcinoma. So yes. Sampletype is biopsy. No nested structure. Ok.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
