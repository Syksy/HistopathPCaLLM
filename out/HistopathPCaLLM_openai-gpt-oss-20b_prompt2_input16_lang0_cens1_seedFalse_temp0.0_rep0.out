analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says: "The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate.... In these, various grades of cell differentiation are observed, although assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues in the digitalized images. Conclusion is that grading of the sample content ought to be conducted manually on the slides prior to digitalization, and then re-entered into the statement system. This scrutiny is warranted, as any mid-grade (i.e. 3+4 or 4+3) differentiation would be very difficult to reliable assess due to some mishap in digitalization."

This is not a valid histopathological statement because it doesn't specify a sample type (biopsy, RP, TURP), doesn't state malignancy, no Gleason. It's a suggestion to do grading manually. So we output NA for all. According to rules: only if it's a valid histopathological statement with Gleason. It's not. So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Ensure JSON format.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
