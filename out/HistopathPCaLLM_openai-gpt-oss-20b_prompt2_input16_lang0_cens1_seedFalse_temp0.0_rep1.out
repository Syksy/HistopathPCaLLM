analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is about suspicious foci from the prostate. It says about half contains tissue that exhibits patterns, various grades of cell differentiation observed, but assigning explicit scores is inconclusive due to resolution issues. Conclusion: grading should be conducted manually. It mentions mid-grade (3+4 or 4+3). But it doesn't give a definitive Gleason grade, just says inconclusive, no explicit grade. So we need to determine if it's a valid histopathological statement. It doesn't give a sample type explicitly. It says "The inspected material consists of multiple suspicious foci from the prostate." That could be a biopsy? It doesn't say biopsy, RP, TURP. Could be ambiguous. So sample type = NA.

Malignancy: The statement says suspicious foci from the prostate, various grades of cell differentiation observed, but no explicit mention of malignant tumor findings. It says "suspicious foci" but no assertion of adenocarcinoma. So likely Malignancy = NA.

Gleason: No grade assigned. So Gleason = NA.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check instructions: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." We are returning no nested. Good.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
