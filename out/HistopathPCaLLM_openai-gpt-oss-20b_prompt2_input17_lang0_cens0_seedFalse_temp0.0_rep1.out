analysisWe need to parse the statement. Identify sample type: It's a prostatectomy prepa rtate => surgical specimen. The allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: reported Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. The most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. So major grade 4, minor grade 3, sum = 4+3=7. So output "4+3=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any nuance: "multiple clear foci emerge in macro sections, with the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3." So yes. So produce that.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
