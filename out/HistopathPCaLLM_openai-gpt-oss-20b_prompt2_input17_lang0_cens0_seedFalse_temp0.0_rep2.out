analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about prostatectomy preparate. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3. That means Gleason score 4+3=7. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check: sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". Ensure string format exactly. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
