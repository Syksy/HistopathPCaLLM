analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is:

"The prepared samples are processed through the standard routine procedures, so that right side of the prostate is indicated differently than the left side. Samples A-D shift focus from basis toward apex, with more apex in E-F and basis in G-N, with remaining material in N-O. Multiple clear well prepared prostate tissue sites can be observed, likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy. This assessment, together with complementing histopathology with full body imaging and status assessment of seminal vehicles, lymph nodes, and capsule intactness will be held out as an assignment to specializing resident candidates in next week's course session. The status update from the consensus will then be appended to this preliminary report."

We need to answer: 1) Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement doesn't specify sample type. It's not biopsy, RP, or TURP. So "NA".

2) Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". The statement says "Multiple clear well prepared prostate tissue sites can be observed, likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This is ambiguous. It says "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." This seems to indicate that Gleason grades 3 to 5 are present, i.e., malignant? It says "or if the material is fully healthy." This is uncertain. We need to decide if malignant tumor findings. The statement doesn't confirm malignant tumor. It says "likely allowing assessment of e.g. differentiation stages Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." It says "are at all present", but it's ambiguous. There's no direct mention of malignant tumor. It might be a borderline.

We need to decide: The statement is not a valid histopathological statement, because it doesn't give a definitive malignant finding. According to instructions, we should only return the most severe lesion. But if we cannot find a malignant statement, we should return "NA" for Malignancy and Gleason. Wait: The instructions: "Please note that only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." The sample example: "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy with Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." yields sampletype "biopsy", Malignancy "yes", Gleason "4+3=7".

The second sample is nonsense, returns NA for all.

In our statement, does it mention any malignant tumor? It mentions Gleason grades 3-5 present or fully healthy. That is ambiguous. There's no explicit mention of malignant tumor. There's no mention of adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, etc.

Thus likely we should consider it not a valid histopathological statement. So output NA for all three. But is there any mention of malignant? "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present" could be interpreted as malignant. But it's ambiguous: "Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy." The phrase "or if the material is fully healthy." suggests uncertainty. The statement doesn't say "malignant tumor" anywhere. So we should output NA.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
