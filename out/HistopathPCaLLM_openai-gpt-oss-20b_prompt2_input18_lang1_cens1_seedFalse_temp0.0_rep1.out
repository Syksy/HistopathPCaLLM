analysisWe need to parse the given statement. Determine sample type: possible values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement: "Näytemateriaali, joka on saatu standardien eturauhasproseduurien yhteydessä, prosessoidaan kahdessatoista kudos-osassa." This implies standard procedures for prostate? The phrase "eturauhasproseduurien" is "prostate procedures". Could be biopsy? Likely "biopsy" because they are processing tissue sections. They mention "small portion shows suspicious focus but too small for reliable grading." So likely a biopsy sample. Sample type: "biopsy".

Malignancy: Are there malignant findings? They say "pieni osa näyttää erottuvan... suspicious focus... may contain small part of ISUP GG 1 or higher, but suspect focus too small for reliable grading." So they are uncertain. There's no definitive mention of malignancy. So "Malignancy" should be "NA" or "ei"? The guidelines say we should return "kyllä" if there are malignant findings, "ei" if not, or "NA" if not applicable. The statement says suspicious but not confirmed. So not definitive malignant. So likely "NA" (not applicable). But maybe they want "ei" because no malignant findings. Let's consider: The sample contains suspicious focus but not enough for grading; but they mention it could be ISUP GG 1 or higher. But not confirmed. The sample shows benign majority. So we can say "ei" (no malignancy). But the guidelines: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä (sallitut arvot "kyllä", "ei" tai "NA")". So if uncertain, maybe NA. But they ask for the worst lesion results only. The sample has no malignant findings reported. So "Malignancy": "ei". Gleason: Only if malignant; since not malignant, Gleason "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check sample type: "biopsy". Yes.

Return JSON.

Let's produce final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
