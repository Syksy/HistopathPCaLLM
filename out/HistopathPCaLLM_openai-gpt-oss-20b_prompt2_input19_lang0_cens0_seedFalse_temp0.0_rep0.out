analysisWe need to produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We must consider the most severe lesion. The statement: "The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: yes, because sample 4 has adenocarcinoma. Gleason: The most severe lesion: sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). The overall Gleason grade is 3+4=7. We need to output "3+4=7". Confirm that the order is major+minor. Usually major is the higher number. Here major=4, minor=3. So "4+3=7". The example uses "4+3=7". So output should be "4+3=7". So:

{
 "Sampletype":"biopsy",
 "Malignancy":"yes",
 "Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Ensure JSON format.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
