analysisWe need to produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "The samples are targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations." So sample type is biopsy. Malignancy: yes because sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma. Gleason: we are to report the most severe lesion. The statement says sample 4 has adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 approx 90% and Gleason 4 10%. So the most severe is Gleason 4. But need to express major+minor=sum. For malignant statements we need "major+minor=sum" as whole numbers. But we have only one grade? Actually they mention grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%). That is like a mixture. Usually Gleason grade is major pattern + minor pattern = sum. In typical description, the major pattern is the predominant (90%: Gleason 3), minor is 10%: Gleason 4. So the Gleason score would be 3+4=7. Wait but they said "larger portion forming grandular structures (Gleason 3, approx 90%) and the smaller part merging grandular structures (Gleason 4, 10%)". So major 3, minor 4 => 3+4=7. But they also mention "breaching of capsule or perineural invasion is not suspected". So the Gleason grade is 3+4=7. So we should output "3+4=7". Malignancy yes. Sampletype biopsy.

Return JSON as specified. Ensure no nested structures. Output only JSON. Let's produce.
