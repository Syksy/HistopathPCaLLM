analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about targeted prostate biopsies. Sample 4 contains adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3 (approx 90%) and Gleason 4 (10%). So overall Gleason pattern mixture: 3 and 4. Usually we report as 3+4=7 or 4+3=7? The example uses "major+minor=sum" where major is higher pattern? In Gleason, the major pattern is the most common (here 3 is 90% vs 4 10%). So major=3 minor=4 sum=7. But the example used 4+3=7 with major+minor. But that example had 4 and 3 with major 4? Actually they said "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So they used major 4 minor 3? Wait they said "Gleason grades 4 and 3". Usually the higher grade is considered minor? In pathology, the first number is the predominant pattern, the second is the secondary. So 4+3=7 would mean 4 is predominant, 3 is secondary. But in the current case, 3 is predominant (90%) and 4 is secondary (10%). So we should use 3+4=7. So the Gleason string should be "3+4=7". Sample type: biopsy. Malignancy yes. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check: The statement is indeed a valid histopathological statement. There's mention of adenocarcinoma, Gleason patterns, etc. So that's correct. No nested structures. Output.assistantfinal```json
