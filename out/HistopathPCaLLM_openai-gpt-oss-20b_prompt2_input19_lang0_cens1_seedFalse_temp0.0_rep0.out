analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about prostate tissue processed as per routine. It says samples 2 and 3 represent healthy benign prostate tissue. Sample 4 has uncertain abnormal tissue possibly malignant. No definitive malignant tumor findings are stated; it's uncertain. There's no Gleason grade. So Malignancy: "NA" or "no"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since it's uncertain, we should use "NA". Sample type: It says "samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." Not clear if biopsy, RP, TURP. It's not specified; so "NA". Gleason: "NA". Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
