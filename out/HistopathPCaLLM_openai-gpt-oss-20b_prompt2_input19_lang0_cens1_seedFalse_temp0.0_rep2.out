analysisWe need to parse the given statement. It's about samples, sample 4 may be malignant. But the statement is uncertain. The question: only the most severe lesion should be returned. But we have no definitive malignant findings. It's uncertain. So likely we should set Malignancy: "NA" or "no"? The instructions say: Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". "NA" for not applicable. If uncertain, maybe "NA". Also Gleason only for malignant statements, otherwise "NA". Original sample type: The statement says "samples are prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type." But sample type? It is not a biopsy, RP, TURP. It says "prostate tissue processed as per routine". So likely "NA". So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Double-check: The statement doesn't mention a clear malignant diagnosis. It's uncertain. So "NA" for malignancy. That matches example where uncertain leads to NA.

Thus output JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
