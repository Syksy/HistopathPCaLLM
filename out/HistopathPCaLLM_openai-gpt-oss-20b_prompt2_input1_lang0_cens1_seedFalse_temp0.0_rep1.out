analysisWe need to parse the statement. It is about representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations being inspected, but it says "Mostly normal cell architectures are observed along with a focus on inspecting epithelial cell characteristics. However, the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings."

So the statement says inconclusive, no clear malignancy described. So it's not a valid histopathological statement. Should output Sampletype: NA, Malignancy: NA, Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
