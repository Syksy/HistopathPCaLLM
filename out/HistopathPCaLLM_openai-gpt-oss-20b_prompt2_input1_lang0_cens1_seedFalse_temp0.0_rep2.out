analysisWe need to parse statement: "Representative prostate cancer samples from standard locations are being inspected. Total amount of sample material is sufficient. Mostly normal cell architectures are observed along with a focus... However, the final results appear inconclusive, highly subjective due to technical artefacts, and additional inspection is required regarding malignancy and potentially clinically significant Gleason findings. MD, John Doe."

This is not a valid histopathological statement because it states inconclusive, no clear malignancy or Gleason. So output should be all NA. According to example, if not valid, all NA.

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"NA",
"Malignancy":"NA",
"Gleason":"NA"
}

Make sure JSON keys match exactly: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
