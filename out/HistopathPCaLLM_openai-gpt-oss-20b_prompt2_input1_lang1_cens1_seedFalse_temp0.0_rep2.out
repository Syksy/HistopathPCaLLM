analysisThe task: produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Input: Finnish text about prostate tissue, but no actual sample type, no malignancy, no Gleason. So expected output is "NA" for all fields.

We need to check instructions: only the worst lesion results should be returned; no nested structures. The example with invalid text returns all NA. So for this input, it's not a valid histopathological statement: it's a general note, no biopsy, no Gleason. So all NA.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return only that.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
