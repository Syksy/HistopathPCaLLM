analysisWe need to produce structured JSON with fields: Sampletype (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). Malignancy: yes/no/NA. Gleason: major+minor=sum or NA.

We have statement: "The presented sample is a prostatectomy resection, which has been divided into six macrosections... Samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma.... Gleason 3+4... while the basis presents mostly with class 4+4. The size... no breaching... surgical margins clear."

We need most severe lesion. The lesion with highest Gleason? They mention apex 3+4, basis 4+4. Most severe is 4+4=8. So Gleason: 4+4=8.

Sample type: "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy? Provided allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So sample type: "RP".

Malignancy: yes (since adenocarcinoma present).

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check no nested. All good.assistantfinal```json
