analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "prostate tissue samples" but no specific type like biopsy, RP, TURP. It says "obtained prostate tissue samples are divided into six main sets". Likely biopsy? But it's not explicitly a biopsy. It might be a surgical specimen (RP?). But the statement says "the obtained prostate tissue samples" but not specifying procedure. Might default to NA. The guidelines: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". If uncertain, choose NA. Malignancy: "assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies given" - basically cannot determine. So malignancy: NA? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')". Since it's impossible to determine, use NA. Gleason: "even in hypothetical scenario... could be found 3+4". But not actually found. So Gleason: NA. So JSON: { "Sampletype": "NA", "Malignancy": "NA", "Gleason": "NA" }.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
