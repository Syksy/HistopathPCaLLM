analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "obtained prostate tissue samples" doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says "obtained prostate tissue samples". No specific procedure. So likely NA.

Malignancy: The text says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies given" and "Even in hypothetical scenario if e.g. lower level Gleason (such as 3+4) could be found". It does not state that adenocarcinoma was found. So malignant tumor findings are not reported. So "no" or "NA"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". Since it's not explicitly stating malignant findings, we should say "no". But the text says "possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies". That implies they cannot determine, but not that it is malignant. So likely "no".

Gleason: Not reported. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if any mention of sample type: "prostate tissue samples" not a standard sample type. So NA. Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
