analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement is basically stating that due to therapies, examination is impossible, no data. So no malignant tumor findings. Sample type: It's not biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA? It says "obtained prostate tissue samples" but no sample type specified. So likely NA. Malignancy: no? But it's uncertain. The statement says "examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to therapies given". So cannot determine. So Malignancy: NA. Gleason: NA. So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if sample type could be "biopsy"? It says "obtained prostate tissue samples" but no method. It's not radical prostatectomy (RP) nor TURP. So NA. So answer.assistantfinal```json
