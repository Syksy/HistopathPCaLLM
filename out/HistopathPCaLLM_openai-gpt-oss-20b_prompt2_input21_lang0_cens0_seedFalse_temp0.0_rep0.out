analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "Prostate chippings total approx 19g, of which 10g have been put to histology." That indicates this is a "RP"? Actually chippings from a radical prostatectomy? The specimen is prostate chippings, likely from a radical prostatectomy (RP). So sample type "RP". Malignant tumor findings: yes, there is tumor-like tissue. Gleason grade: The most common Gleason grading is 5 and second most common is 4. They didn't give sum? Usually Gleason grade is sum of primary+secondary. They say "most common Gleason grading as 5" that sounds like the primary (largest pattern) is 5, second most common is 4. So might be Gleason 5+4=9. But we need the reported Gleason grade. The statement: "most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4." So the major grade is 5, minor is 4. Sum 9. So output: "5+4=9". Ensure format. Provide JSON: Sampletype "RP", Malignancy "yes", Gleason "5+4=9".assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
