analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish statement. Determine sample type: "Prostatalastuja yhteensä noin 19g, josta laitettu 10g histologiaan." Means they took prostate samples, total 19g, 10g used for histology. That is a biopsy? It's a surgical specimen? It might be radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP? They say "Prostatalastuja" maybe "prostate samples" - could be from a biopsy? The phrase "josta laitettu 10g histologiaan" suggests a surgical specimen (like prostatectomy) where 10g tissue was sent for histology. They didn't say "biopsia" or "radical prostatectomy" explicitly. "Prostatalastuja" could be "prostate samples" from a prostatectomy. Typically a radical prostatectomy yields a whole prostate (~30-40g). 10g histology could be a portion. So sample type likely "RP"? But "biopsy" is usually 1-2g. 19g is large. So probably RP. Let's choose Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: They mention "Noin puolet lastujen pinta-alasta kasvainkudosta, jossa Gleason luokituksessa eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." They found tumor tissue in about half of the sample area. So malignant. So "kyllä".

Gleason: "eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4." That means majority grade 5 and second most grade 4. So Gleason major+minor? They didn't give exact sums. Usually Gleason 5+4=9. So output "5+4=9".

Thus final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Should we consider that it's not a biopsy but a surgical specimen. So "RP" seems correct.

No nested structure.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
