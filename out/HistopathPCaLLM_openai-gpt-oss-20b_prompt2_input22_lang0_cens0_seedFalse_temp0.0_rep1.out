analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "A container of prostate thick needle biopsies" -> biopsy. So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Were there malignant tumor findings? Yes, left side fragments exhibit carcinoma with Gleason score 3 and 4, so malignant yes.

Reported Gleason grade: They mention "low grade differentation of carcinoma tissue structures, firstly comprising of Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4". So Gleason major 4 minor 3 sum 7. So "4+3=7". Use format "4+3=7".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
