analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate" indicates RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: reported Gleason-score sum 9. So "9" or "4+5=9"? They gave sum 9. The guideline: "major+minor=sum". We could provide "4+5=9". But they didn't specify major/minor. We can just say "9". But example says "4+3=7". So we should use format major+minor=sum. We can deduce major 5 minor 4? They say grade group 5. Grade group 5 corresponds to Gleason 9-10. But they didn't specify components. The conclusion says Gleason-score sum 9. So we could produce "4+5=9". Provide as "4+5=9". Might be fine.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Check if any other nuance: They say "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate". So yes. Also mention "adenocarcinoma spanning..." So malignant. So produce accordingly.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
