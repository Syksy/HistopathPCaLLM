analysisWe need to parse the statement, identify sample type: It says "Sections from a prostatectomy preparate". So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). The malignant tumor findings: yes. The reported Gleason grade: "Gleason-score sum 9". So "9". But format is "major+minor=sum" like "4+3=7". Here we have sum only, not major/minor. But allowed values presumably prefer "major+minor=sum" if available. The statement does not give major/minor. It says "Gleason-score sum 9". So maybe just "9"? But guidelines say "preferred'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements". If not available, we could use just "9". However, maybe we can interpret as 4+5=9? But not stated. So output "9". Let's output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "9"
}

But maybe we could do "4+5=9" if we assume typical? But the statement says "Gleason-score sum 9, grade group 5." So let's use "9". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "9"
}
```
