analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish pathology report. The structure: Sampletype: we have "prostatectomia" i.e., prostatectomy, also called radical prostatectomy (RP). The allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So sample type is "RP".

Malignancy: Is there malignant findings? Yes, adenocarcinoma. So "kyllä".

Gleason: The report says Gleason points sum is 9, grade group 5. So Gleason is "4+5=9"? Wait, they mention the component distribution: 4 (60%), 5 (30%) and a third small 3. But the sum of major+minor equals 9, presumably 4+5=9. The Gleason sum is 9. So we should output "4+5=9" or just "9"? The spec: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot'major+minor=sum' muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja 'NA' hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So for malignant, we give major+minor=sum. In this case, the major component is 5? Actually the typical major is 5 (the highest grade). Minor 4. So sum 9. So "5+4=9" or "4+5=9". They said "major+minor=sum" but typical ordering is major first. So "5+4=9" is correct. But the example earlier used "4+3=7". They used minor+major? They said "Gleason luokilla 4 ja 3, joten summa 4+3=7." That used 4 and 3 as major? Actually 4 is the major, 3 minor. So they used major+minor. So we should use major+minor. So "5+4=9". But they also said "Edustaa pääosin erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (60%). Toiseksi yleisin luokka 5 (n. 30% osuus)". That suggests 4 is major, 5 minor? But the second line says "Toiseksi yleisin luokka 5". That might be minor? Actually typical Gleason: the first number is the most common pattern (major), the second number is the second most common pattern (minor). So 4 is major, 5 is minor. So sum 4+5=9. So major+minor=4+5=9. So we should output "4+5=9". But the order might be "major+minor=sum". So "4+5=9" is correct.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Check spec: The sample type allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP".

Malignancy: "kyllä".

Gleason: "4+5=9".

Return just that JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
