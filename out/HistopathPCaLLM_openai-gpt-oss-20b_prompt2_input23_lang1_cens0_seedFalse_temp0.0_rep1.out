analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine Sampletype: The sample type is a prostatectomy specimen (radical prostatectomy). Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" (radical prostatectomy).

Malignancy: There are malignant findings: adenocarcinoma. So "kyllä".

Gleason: Provided Gleason-pistesumma is 9. That's sum of major+minor. Should output "major+minor=sum" but we don't know major/minor? The statement says "Gleason-pistesumma on 9, grade group 5." We need to provide "major+minor=sum" form. But we only know sum 9. We might guess typical composition: grade group 5 corresponds to 4+5=9 or 5+4=9. Usually major 5 minor 4 => 5+4=9. So we should output "5+4=9". Alternatively could be 4+5=9 but major is 5. We need "major+minor=sum". So "5+4=9". That is acceptable.

Thus JSON:
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

We need to ensure no nested structure. Provide final JSON.
