analysisWe need to output JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Determine sample type: The statement refers to "Näytteeksi saadusta prostatektomiapreparaastista..." So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: presence of adenocarcinoma, so "kyllä". Gleason: reported sum is 9, grade group 5. So Gleason string "9" or "9"? Format "major+minor=sum". But we have no major/minor given. However we can use "NA" if not pahanlaatuis? But malignancy present. We need "major+minor=sum" in integer form. Since sum reported 9. We can just output "9" or "9"? The example earlier used "4+3=7". But if only sum known, maybe "9". The instruction says "sallitut arvot'major+minor=sum' muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille". So it expects a string like "4+3=7". But we have sum 9. We could output "9" but that's not in format. However we could interpret as "4+5=9" maybe? But not provided. Better to output "9" as sum. Or "NA"? No, since malignancy present. I'll output "9" as sum. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "9"
