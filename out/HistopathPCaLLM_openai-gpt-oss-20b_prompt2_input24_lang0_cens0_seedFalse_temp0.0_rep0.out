analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a prostate cancer histopathological statement. Extract sample type: "turp-chippings" implies TURP. So Sampletype: "TURP". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: reported "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". The statement says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So the Gleason grade likely 4+4=8? But it says "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". We have to output "4+4=8" or just "8"? The guidelines: "reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we should provide "4+4=8". There's mention "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" – that is the major grade. The minor might be 4? It's ambiguous. But the sum is 8. So we output "4+4=8". That matches guidelines.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "TURP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check for other sample type: "turp-chippings" is TURP. Good.

Return JSON only.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
