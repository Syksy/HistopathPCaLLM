analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "turp-chippings" -> TURP. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: They mention "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth" and "sum 8 adenocarcinoma". So Gleason 4+? They mention sum 8. Usually Gleason 4+? The sum 8 implies major 4 minor 4? But they say "Gleason 4 -class tumor growth." That suggests major 4. But sum 8? Possibly 4+4=8. So we can output "4+4=8". Use the most severe lesion. There is malignant suspicion, sum 8 adenocarcinoma. So Malignancy yes. Gleason "4+4=8". Let's produce JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
