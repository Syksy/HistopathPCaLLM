analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We must use the most severe lesion. The statement mentions multiple samples: sample 1 has tumor with Gleason 4 pattern 20% and 3 pattern 30% (so major=4 minor=3 sum=7). Sample 2 also has tumor with Gleason 4 ~15% and 3 less than 35% (so also sum 7). Sample 3 no abnormal. The overall conclusion: presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. So malignancy yes. Sampletype: probably biopsy? There's no explicit mention but "Sample" suggests biopsy. They don't say biopsy, RP, TURP. Usually "Sample" from a biopsy? We need to choose from allowed set: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. Since it's from multiple tissue cylinders, likely from a biopsy. So Sampletype: biopsy. Gleason: we need the most severe lesion: both have same Gleason 4+3=7. Use that. So JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any more severe like 4+3 vs maybe 4+3? same. So good. Ensure no nested. Output only JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
