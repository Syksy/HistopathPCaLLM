analysisWe need to parse given Finnish pathology report. Determine sample type? The sample likely from biopsy? They say "Näyte". Could be biopsy. No mention of radical prostatectomy or TURP. So Sampletype likely "biopsy". Malignancy yes, because adenocarcinoma present. Gleason: need to report major+minor=sum. For each sample? But we only return one set of values for the whole statement? The instruction: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" meaning only the worst lesion results should be returned. So we choose the worst Gleason among the samples. The worst lesion: highest Gleason sum. Sample (1) has Gleason 4 (20%) and 3 (30%) => sum 7. Sample (2) Gleason 4 (15%) and 3 (35%) => sum 7. Sample (3) no abnormal. So worst sum = 7. So Gleason "4+3=7". Malignancy "kyllä". Sampletype "biopsy". Provide JSON. Ensure no nested structures. Output exactly JSON object.assistantfinal```json
