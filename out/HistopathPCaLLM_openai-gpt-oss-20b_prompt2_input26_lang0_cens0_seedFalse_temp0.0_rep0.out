analysisWe need to parse the statement. The task: produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate". That is a radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype "RP". Malignancy: yes (tumor present). Gleason: reported: "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." That indicates a Gleason score with major 4, minor 3, sum 7. So "4+3=7". Must be the most severe lesion. There's only one malignant lesion. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Double-check: "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." That implies pattern 3+4 or 4+3? "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentation is almost as prevalent." Means 3 and 4 both present equally. Which is major? Usually major is higher grade, so 4 is major. So 4+3=7. Good. Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
