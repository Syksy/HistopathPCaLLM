analysisWe need to parse statement.

Statement: "The studied specimen is a prostatectomy preparate..." So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes (widely spread tumor). Gleason grade: "dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation is almost as prevalent." Usually Gleason score: major + minor. Here they say dominant Gleason is class 3 and class 4 differentiation. So typical Gleason pattern 3 and 4. So Gleason 3+4=7. Should we output "3+4=7"? The instruction says "major+minor=sum". So yes "3+4=7". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check that no other malignant statements. No. Provide final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
