analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text, determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason.

Rules: Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The sample type is "prostatectomypreparaat" (treatment of prostatectomie? "prostatektomiapreparaatti" means prostatectomy specimen). That likely corresponds to "RP" (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: "kyllä" if malignant findings present; yes, there is a tumor. So "kyllä".

Gleason: report Gleason class. The text says: "Suurin kasvainfokus on basiksen puolella, missä vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." That means the predominant Gleason is 3 and grade 4 present roughly equal. So Gleason score would be 3+4=7. Could also possibly 4+3=7. The format required "major+minor=sum" with integers. We need to decide which is major, which minor. It says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." So major is 3? Usually major grade is the higher. But here it's 3 and 4 roughly equal. But typical Gleason: major is the most common, minor is the second. If equal, sometimes you say 3+4 or 4+3. The example says "4 and 3, sum 4+3=7." They used major=4, minor=3. But that was example with 4 and 3. In our case, major 3, minor 4? But 4 is higher. But they said "vallitseva luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." Means predominant 3, near equal 4. So major=3, minor=4. So "3+4=7". But typical Gleason score would be 3+4=7 (major 3, minor 4). That sum is 7. So answer: "3+4=7".

Now produce JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check that it's correct. Ensure no nested structures. Provide as JSON. Good.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
