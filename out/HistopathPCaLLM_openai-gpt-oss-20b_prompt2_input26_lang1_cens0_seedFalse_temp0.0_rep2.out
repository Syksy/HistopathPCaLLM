analysisWe need to parse the provided statement (Finnish) and output JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. According to instructions, only the worst lesion results should be returned, not nested.

We need to decide:

1. Sampletype: The sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text says "Tutkittavana on prostatektomiapreparaatti". That is a prostatectomy specimen (radical prostatectomy). So sample type likely "RP".

2. Malignancy: was there malignant findings? The statement says "Histologiassa nähdään laaja kasvain" which means a large tumor, malignant. So "kyllä".

3. Gleason: For malignant findings, we need "major+minor=sum" format. The text says "Suurin kasvainfokus on basiksen puolella, missä vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." So the Gleason pattern 3 and 4 present nearly equally. The major pattern is 4? Usually Gleason score is sum of dominant and secondary patterns. When they are equal, maybe 4+3=7 or 3+4=7. But the sample says "vallitseva Gleason luokka 3, ja luokan 4 erilaistumista melkein yhtä paljon." The dominant pattern is 3? It says vallitseva (dominant) is 3, and 4 is almost as much. So we could say 3+4=7. Typically the order is major+minor with major first. So "3+4=7".

We need to produce JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Double-check: The instructions say that for malignant findings we output "major+minor=sum" format. So we need to output "3+4=7". Good.

Also check that there is no nested structure. Just top-level keys.

Return as JSON. Ensure keys are as specified: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Ok.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
