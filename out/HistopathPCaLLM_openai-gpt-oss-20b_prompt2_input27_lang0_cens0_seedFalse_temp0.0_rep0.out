analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes. Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G, where the growth pattern was Gleason 3+3=6." Sample type? It's shavings. That suggests a radical prostatectomy? Shavings from a prostate specimen? Usually from radical prostatectomy or TURP? Shavings implies a surgical specimen from RP. The allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". Shavings suggests RP. So "RP". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 3+3=6. So JSON: { "Sampletype": "RP", "Malignancy": "yes", "Gleason": "3+3=6" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
