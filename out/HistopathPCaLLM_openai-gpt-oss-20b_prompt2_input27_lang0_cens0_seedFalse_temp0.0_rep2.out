analysisWe need to parse the statement "Total 13g of shavings were run on eight casettes. Carcinoma was histologically detected in blocks F & G, where the growth pattern was Gleason 3+3=6."

We need to determine Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "shavings were run on eight casettes". This is likely a surgical specimen, maybe radical prostatectomy (RP) or something. Shavings suggests a frozen section? The sample type might be "RP" if it's a radical prostatectomy. "shavings" are from a prostatectomy specimen, often called "shavings" during frozen section. So likely "RP".

Malignancy: yes, because carcinoma detected.

Gleason: 3+3=6.

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"RP",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"3+3=6"
}

Check if any other nuance: Only most severe lesion – there is only one lesion. So return that.

Thus output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}
```
