analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Yhteensä 13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla. Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti blokeissa F & G, joiden kasvutapa oli Gleason 3+3=6."

We need to produce JSON with fields Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We need to determine sample type. The statement indicates that 13g tissue was processed in eight blocks. That sounds like a radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP? It says "käsiteltiin...". It's not a biopsy, it's a resection. The sample type: "RP" if it's a radical prostatectomy. But we only see "käsiteltiin...". It says "13g edestä höyläyslastuja ajettiin kahdeksalla kasetilla." That might refer to "prostate resection" or "TURP"? Usually TURP would talk about "paksu" or "molekyylit" but it's resection of prostate tissue. However, 13g total weight from "height"? Might be a radical prostatectomy sample: they excise the prostate and weigh 13g. "Höyläyslastuja" means "brush samples" maybe? Could be a biopsy. But "blokeissa F & G" indicates blocks from the prostate. It might be from a radical prostatectomy specimen.

We should consider the typical sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP". The sample type is likely "RP" because it's a larger tissue weight and blocks. So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: Yes, since carcinoma found. So "kyllä".

Gleason: reported "3+3=6" which is sum 6. We need "major+minor=sum" format. So "3+3=6".

Return JSON.

Check for other possibilities: The statement also says "Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti blokeissa F & G, joiden kasvutapa oli Gleason 3+3=6." So yes, carcinoma present, Gleason 3+3=6.

Thus output:

{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+3=6"
}

Make sure JSON keys exactly as specified: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Use double quotes. Output only JSON.assistantfinal{
