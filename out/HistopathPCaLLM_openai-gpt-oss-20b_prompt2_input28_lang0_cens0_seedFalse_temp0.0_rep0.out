analysisWe need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We must only consider most severe lesion. The sample type: statement says "biopsy cylinders". So sample type "biopsy". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: highest grade malignant finding was focus 1 with point sum 8, so Gleason "4+4=8". Output JSON object with those fields. Ensure format: keys exactly "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
