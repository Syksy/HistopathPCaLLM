analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Examination consists of six biopsy cylinders that had been taken due to elevated PSA. Focus #1 on the front of left side exhibits 5mm length of poorly differentiated atypical grandular structure. This appears to be adenocarcinoma, with Gleason classification 4+4=8. Focus #2 on the middle of the left side also exhibits 10mm length of adenocarcinoma tissue, with Gleason point sum 4+3=7 and grade 4 proportion approx 80%. Focus 3# on the middle section on the right side also contains a finding with grades 4 and 3 with proportions approx. 70:30%, thus sum 7 (3+4). In the rest of the samples mostly hyperplastic changes are seen in the epithelial cells. As a summary, the highest grade malignant finding was in focus 1 with point sum 8."

We need to output a JSON with three fields:

1. Sampletype: "biopsy" (since it's biopsy cylinders). Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "biopsy".

2. Malignancy: "yes" because there is adenocarcinoma.

3. Gleason: The most severe lesion: Focus #1 had Gleason 4+4=8. That is the highest. So Gleason: "4+4=8".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Ensure valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
