analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a description of six sites, with atypical growth patterns, unclear differentiation, possible pre-malignant changes, etc. No mention of malignant tumor findings, no Gleason score. So presumably not a valid histopathological statement. We should output Sampletype: "NA", Malignancy: "NA", Gleason: "NA".

Check: The instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." But we only have one statement. It's not a valid histopathological statement. So as per example for invalid statement, all fields "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure no extra formatting.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
