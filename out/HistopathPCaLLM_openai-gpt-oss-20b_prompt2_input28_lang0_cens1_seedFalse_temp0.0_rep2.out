analysisWe need to decide if it's a valid histopathological statement. The statement describes six sites, atypical growth patterns, unclear differentiation, possible pre-malignant changes 80%, hyperlastic changes. It doesn't mention malignant tumor findings, nor a Gleason grade. It's not a clear malignant statement. So we should output "NA" for all fields. That matches the second example. Therefore:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
