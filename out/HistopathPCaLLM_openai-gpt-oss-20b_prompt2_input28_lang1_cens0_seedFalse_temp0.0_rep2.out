analysisWe need to parse the Finnish text, determine sample type, whether malignancy present, and Gleason. According to instructions: only return the worst lesion results. We have multiple biopsies. The worst Gleason is 8 from biopsy 1. So output:

Sampletype: "biopsy" (since it's a biopsy). Malignancy: "kyllä" (since malignant). Gleason: "4+4=8".

Edge: We should ensure no other info included. The JSON keys: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Return JSON object. Ensure no extra stuff. Let's produce final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
