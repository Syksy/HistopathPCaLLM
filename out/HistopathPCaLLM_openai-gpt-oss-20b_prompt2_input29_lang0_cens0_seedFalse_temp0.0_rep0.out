analysisWe need to parse this statement. It is a pathology report: "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen, with weight approx 40g. Samples were taken as follows:... From the left lobe casettes A and C invasive adenocarcinoma is observed, which has penetrated the capsule and perineural invasion is also present. Tumor cells form both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4. Tumor diameter is larger than 2 cm. SUMMARY: Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections."

We need to provide JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype: the sample type. They mention "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen". That is likely radical prostatectomy (RP). Usually "fresh sample specimen" is a surgical specimen, i.e., radical prostatectomy. Not biopsy or TURP. So sampletype = "RP".

Malignancy: yes (there is invasive adenocarcinoma). So "yes".

Gleason: The statement "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." That indicates Gleason score 7 (likely 3+4 or 4+3). They also mention "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." Actually "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That seems confusing: both are grade 4? But maybe they mean "mostly grade 3 and smaller portion grade 4"? But they wrote "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That might be a typo; maybe they meant "mostly grade 3, smaller portion grade 4"? But the summary says Score sum 7. So Gleason: "4+3=7" or "3+4=7"? We can't confirm which pattern. Usually if the predominant grade is 4, then it's 4+3=7. But the phrase "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" doesn't make sense. Let's assume predominant is grade 4, minor grade 3. So Gleason "4+3=7". But we could also put "7" but they want "major+minor=sum". So we provide "4+3=7".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Be careful to not nest. Ensure values are correct. Provide valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
