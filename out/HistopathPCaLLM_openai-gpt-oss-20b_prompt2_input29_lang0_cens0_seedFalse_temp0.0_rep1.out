analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: statement says "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" that likely refers to radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. So "Sampletype": "RP".

Malignancy: yes.

Gleason: They mention "most grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4". Wait they say "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That seems like all grade 4? But earlier "tumor cells form both poorly differentiated as well fused grandular structures; mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That seems inconsistent: maybe they meant "mostly grade 4, with smaller portion grade 3"? But they didn't mention grade 3. There is mention "Score sum 7". So they say sum 7. So Gleason: "4+3=7" or "7"? The question says "reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we should output "4+3=7". Even though they didn't explicitly say grade 3, the summary says sum 7. So we can output that.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

We must ensure no other fields. Provide valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
