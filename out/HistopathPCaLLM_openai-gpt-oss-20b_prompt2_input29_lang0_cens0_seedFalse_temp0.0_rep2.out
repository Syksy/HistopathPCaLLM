analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: The sample is "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen" presumably a radical prostatectomy? The statement says "Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen". That could be from a radical prostatectomy (RP). But the statement also references "Samples were taken as follows: closest to apex A - left lobe, B - right lobe, etc." That sounds like a surgical specimen. So sample type is likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy). It is not a biopsy or TURP. So Sampletype: "RP".

Malignancy: yes. It's a malignant adenocarcinoma with invasive features.

Gleason: They mention "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4" Wait they said "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That seems off. Usually Gleason patterns are 1-5. They mention grade 4 differentiation pattern. They didn't mention grade 3. So would be 4+? But they mention "score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." So the Gleason sum is 7. But the sum's pattern? 4+3=7 perhaps. They say "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." Actually that might be 4+? Wait "mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4." That suggests both major and minor are grade 4? But then sum would be 4+4=8, not 7. But they state "Score sum 7 finding in the left side sections." So the reported Gleason sum is 7. Possibly 4+3. But they didn't mention 3. But maybe the 3 is the smaller portion. But they said "smaller portion as grade 4" maybe a mis-typo. But we must use the sum as given: 7. So Gleason: "4+3=7" presumably. But the statement explicitly says "Score sum 7". We need to provide "major+minor=sum". So we can produce "4+3=7". But we must decide major and minor. Could be "4+3=7". Provide that.

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "yes",
"Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any possibility of "NA" for sample type: It's definitely a specimen from prostate. So not NA. So answer that.assistantfinal```json
