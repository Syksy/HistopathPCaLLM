analysisWe need to parse the statement. We have a prostate tissue sample, but sample indices A and C are non-prostatic tissue, contamination. They cannot assess tumor features. They say score sum determination was not possible, samples A and C to be re-examined.

Thus the statement seems to indicate no malignant tumor findings? There's no mention of malignant tumor. They say "non-prostatic tissue observed" and cannot assess. No Gleason. So we should return Sampletype: "NA" or maybe the sample type is not defined. The statement doesn't specify biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP. It says "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained". That could be from a surgical specimen? Hard to say. But sample type should be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Since they didn't specify, use NA.

Malignancy: "NA" because cannot assess. Or "no"? But they didn't find malignant tumor. They mention non-prostatic tissue. We can infer no malignant tumor. But we are told to only return results from the most severe lesion. If none, then "NA" for malignancy? The guidelines: For benign statements, Gleason should be "NA". So Malignancy should be "no"? The example for invalid statement gives NA for Malignancy. But for a benign statement, should it be "no"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")." So if no malignant tumor, we should put "no". But the example for invalid statement uses NA. But the invalid statement is not a valid histopathological statement. In our case, the statement is not a valid histopathological statement? They don't give a Gleason score because cannot determine. But does that mean it's invalid? The statement says "Score sum determination was not possible". That indicates no Gleason. But is that a valid histopathological statement? Possibly yes, it's a statement about the sample. But it's not giving malignant tumor? It's indicating no malignant tumor? Hard to interpret. The guidelines: "Only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". If there is no malignant tumor, we could return "no" for Malignancy and "NA" for Gleason. But sample type? We don't know. So "NA".

Thus output should be:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But could "no" be wrong? The statement indicates absence of malignant tumor findings? They didn't find malignant tumor. They mention non-prostatic tissue. So no malignant tumor. So "no".
