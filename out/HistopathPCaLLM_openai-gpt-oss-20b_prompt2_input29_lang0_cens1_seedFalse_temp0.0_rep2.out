analysisWe must parse the statement. It's about prostate tissue, but says samples A and C non-prostatic tissue observed, cannot assess tumor. The summary: score sum determination not possible. So no malignant tumor findings? The statement indicates that the samples had non-prostatic tissue; no mention of malignant tumor. So Malignancy: no? However the question: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." If there's no mention of malignancy, likely "no". But if ambiguous, maybe NA. The statement says cannot assess tumor cells; no detection. So likely "no". Gleason grade: NA. Sampletype: It's fresh prostate tissue material obtained, but the sample type? Not biopsy? It says "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained". Could be RP? It doesn't mention radical prostatectomy (RP). It's a sampling procedure; maybe biopsy? But they say "samples were taken as follows: A - left lower...". That could be a biopsy. So sample type: biopsy. Alternatively NA because not clearly a biopsy. The allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So we must pick one. The text says "Fresh prostate tissue material was obtained, with material amount fitting the original sample collection request." Might be a biopsy. So choose "biopsy".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check: do we need to include "NA" for malignancy if no malignant tumor findings? The allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no" is acceptable. Since they didn't find malignant tumor, "no". Good.
