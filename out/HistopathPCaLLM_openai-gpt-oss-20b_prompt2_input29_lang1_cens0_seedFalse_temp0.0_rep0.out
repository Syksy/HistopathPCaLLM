analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: "Tuorenäytteenä saatu prostata" means "surgical specimen", so "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "Pistesumman 7" indicates Gleason 4+3=7. So output JSON with fields.

We have to output only top-level properties, no nested. Use allowed values: Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: "kyllä". Gleason: "4+3=7".

Check if any nuance: maybe "Pistesumman 7" means the sum is 7, but the breakdown is 4 and 3. Since it's a surgical specimen, also "Pistesumman 7" indicates Gleason 4+3=7. So output accordingly.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
