analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: biopsy? The case: "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin" – suggests fresh prostate tissue material. They took samples A-F. Some were non-prostate. They couldn't assess malignancy. So likely it's a biopsy? It is fresh tissue from prostate, but the sample type is likely "biopsy". But it's not clear if it's radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP. It's a biopsy. So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: we don't have evidence of malignancy. It's indeterminate. The statement says no assessment possible. So "Malignancy": "NA" because not determined.

Gleason: Not reported. So "NA".

Return JSON.

Let's produce:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check formatting.

Yes.
