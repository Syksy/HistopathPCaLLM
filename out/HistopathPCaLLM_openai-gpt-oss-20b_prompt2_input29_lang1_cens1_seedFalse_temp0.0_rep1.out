analysisWe need to parse Finnish text. Determine if it's a valid histopathology statement. The text appears to be about fresh prostate tissue, sample description, contamination, no Gleason score. It's not a pathological report. So the answer should be NA for all fields. According to instructions: If not a valid histopathology statement, output all NA. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return only that JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
