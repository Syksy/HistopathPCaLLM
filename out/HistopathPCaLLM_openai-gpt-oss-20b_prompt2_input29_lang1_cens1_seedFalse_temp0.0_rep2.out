analysisWe need to parse the given statement. Determine sample type: The statement describes prostate tissue material obtained. It says "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali saatiin". The samples were taken as A-F. But some were non-prostate tissue. There's no mention of biopsy, radical prostatectomy (RP), TURP. It's just a prostate tissue sample (maybe from a core biopsy?). The phrase "Tuore prostatakudos materiaali" indicates it's a biopsy? Could be a transrectal ultrasound guided core biopsy. But not explicitly. We can treat sample type as "biopsy" probably. However, the statement says that some samples were not prostate tissue, contamination. There is no mention of malignancy detection. They could not determine Gleason. So "Malignancy" is "NA" because we lack data. And Gleason "NA". So we need JSON with Sampletype "biopsy" maybe? Or "NA" if ambiguous. The sample type must be one of the allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement doesn't explicitly mention "biopsy", but mentions "tuore prostatakudos materiaali" and "näytteet" that were taken. Could be a biopsy. I'd lean "biopsy". Malignancy: "NA" because no malignancy reported. Gleason: "NA". So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Let's check if they want "Malignancy" to be "kyllä", "ei" or "NA". Since no malignant findings reported, but not stated "ei" either. It's ambiguous, so "NA". So final JSON accordingly.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
