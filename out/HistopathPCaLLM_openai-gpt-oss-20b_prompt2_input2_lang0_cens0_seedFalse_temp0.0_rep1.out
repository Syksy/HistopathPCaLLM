analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "The sample is a fresh prostatectomy specimen" but also "original sample is an autopsy sample intended for research use." That seems contradictory. We need the original sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" or "NA". "Fresh prostatectomy specimen" suggests radical prostatectomy. But then says original sample is autopsy sample. That might be a mislabel. We should pick the most specific: "RP" likely. However autopsy sample is not a typical type. The allowed list: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So we choose "RP" as the sample type. Malignancy: No malignant tumor findings. It says normal benign growth, no abnormal growth, no tumor. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: Since no malignant, should be "NA". Output JSON with those fields.

Ensure no nested structure. Straight JSON. Let's produce: Sampletype: "RP", Malignancy: "no", Gleason: "NA".assistantfinal```json
{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
