analysisWe need to parse the statement. We have a sample type. They say "The fresh sample is obtained from an autopsy specimen intended for research use." Sample type allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Autopsy specimen is not one of these; so sample type = "NA".

Malignancy: The statement says "potential adenocarcinoma or other malignant changes" but not confirmed, uncertain. So malignant tumor findings: the statement indicates cannot be reliably inferred, no malignant findings confirmed. So "no" or "NA"? The guidelines: "Were there malignant tumor findings" allowed values "yes", "no" or "NA". Since no definitive evidence, likely "no". But the statement says "potential adenocarcinoma" but uncertain. So we can interpret as no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: Only if malignant. Since no malignant, Gleason should be "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
