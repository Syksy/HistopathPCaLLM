analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement? Let's analyze.

The statement:

"APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Cells had shown a lot of atrophy and possibly some atypical patterns, but the notable amount of burn artefacts on the histological slides made interpretation difficult. Basal cell structures were also observed. JD & JD both confirmed that the samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells do show a diffentiation of grade 4 (most common pattern) and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5. The relatively uncertain diagnosis (3+3) from the patient from before should be updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma (Grade Group 3 after revision, prior GG 1). The patient should be contacted to discuss further options."

We have sample type? Not explicitly mentioned; maybe "biopsy"? It says "samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells". That implies a biopsy? Could be TURP? But it's "chippings near the urothelial cells" - could be biopsy. No explicit sample type. So maybe NA.

Malignancy? It says "moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma" - malignant yes.

Gleason: It says "grade 4 and secondary pattern grade 3, with tertiary pattern grade 5". The major+minor sum: Usually Gleason pattern 4 + 3 = 7? But they mention tertiary pattern grade 5. In histopathology, Gleason score is major/minor. So major pattern 4, minor pattern 3. Sum 7. They mention tertiary pattern grade 5 but not used in Gleason sum. So Gleason 4+3=7. They also mention earlier uncertain diagnosis (3+3) from patient before should be updated to moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma. That is 3+3=6. But updated to 4+3=7. So the most severe lesion is 4+3=7. So Gleason "4+3=7".

Thus output:

Sampletype: "NA" (since sample type not given). Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7".
