analysisWe must parse the statement and determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason. The text: "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Originally, atypical findings were suspected in the cells, but JD & JD could not confirm or deny the suspicions. The earlier uncertain diagnosis of the patient could therefore not be determined, defining their status requires further examination. The patient must be contacted."

We need to see if it is a valid histopathological statement. It describes uncertain diagnosis, atypical findings suspected, but not confirmed. No specific sample type, malignant tumor findings, nor Gleason grade. So should output NA for all fields.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
