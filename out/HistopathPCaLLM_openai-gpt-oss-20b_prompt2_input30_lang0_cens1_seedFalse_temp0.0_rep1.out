analysisWe need to parse this statement: "APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION: John Doe and Jane Doe were consulted at a joint meeting, due to some uncertainties regarding the findings. Originally, atypical findings were suspected in the cells, but JD & JD could not confirm or deny the suspicions. The earlier uncertain diagnosis of the patient could therefore not be determined, defining their status requires further examination. The patient must be contacted."

We need to determine sample type: allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. Statement doesn't mention sample type. So NA.

Malignancy: yes, no, or NA. The statement says atypical findings suspected, but not confirmed. So malignancy cannot be determined. So NA.

Gleason: only if malignant. Since malignancy is NA, Gleason NA.

Thus output JSON with NA for all fields. The structure example: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}.

We must ensure correct field names: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide JSON.

Make sure no nested structures. Done.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
