analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about an APPENDIX, AD consultation: John Doe and Jane Doe consulted; uncertainties regarding findings; originally atypical findings suspected but could not confirm; earlier uncertain diagnosis could not be determined; status requires further examination. No mention of sample type, biopsy, RP, TURP. No mention of malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade. So all NA. Return JSON with Sampletype "NA", Malignancy "NA", Gleason "NA".assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
