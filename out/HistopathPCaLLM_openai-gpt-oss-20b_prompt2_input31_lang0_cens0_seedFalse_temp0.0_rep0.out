analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement says: "The patient had undergone routine systematic biopsy, where only a minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6 was found." So initial biopsy found Gleason 6. Then two targeted biopsies: first failed. Second had large focus 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4. Also says second most common differentiation pattern is 5. So the Gleason score: primary pattern 4, secondary pattern 5. So Gleason 4+5=9. That is the most severe lesion. So sample type: "biopsy" (they did two targeted biopsies). But also mention "systematic biopsy" earlier. Which is the most severe? The targeted biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: 4+5=9. So output JSON accordingly. Ensure no nested structures. All allowed values: Sampletype "biopsy", Malignancy "yes", Gleason "4+5=9".assistantfinal{
