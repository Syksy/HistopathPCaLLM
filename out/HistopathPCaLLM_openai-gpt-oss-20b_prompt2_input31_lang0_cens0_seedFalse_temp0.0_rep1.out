analysisWe need to produce structured data JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Only the most severe lesion should be returned, no nested structures.

We have a statement: "The patient had undergone routine systematic biopsy, where only a minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6 was found. This led to active surveillance. However, the patient has since developed active symptons, and PSA levels have elevated rapidly (latest value already >100). This led to two targeted biopsies done using imaging for guidance. In the first targeted biopsy there was a technical failure resulting in loss of the material, but the second targeted biopsy hit a large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4. The patient had already started radiotherapy, which made interpretation of the cell morphological changes difficult. However, it would strongly appear that the second most common differentiation pattern is 5. The novel findings confirm that the previous Gleason sum 6 did not capture the most aggressive tumor characteristics. The patient treatment plan has already been updated based on the new findings."

We need to identify the most severe lesion. We have two targeted biopsies: first lost, second had large focus 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4, and second most common differentiation pattern is 5. So the Gleason pattern: primary 4, secondary 5 => 4+5=9. So the most severe lesion is Gleason 4+5=9 from the second targeted biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy" (since it's a biopsy). Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+5=9".

We must confirm: "sample type" allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. The statement says "two targeted biopsies done using imaging for guidance." So sample type is biopsy. Yes.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

We need to ensure JSON format no nested structures. That's it.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
