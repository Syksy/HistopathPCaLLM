analysisWe need to parse the statement. We must output JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Only the most severe lesion should be returned. The statement mentions two targeted biopsies; first failed, second hit large focus of almost 10mm with primary differentiation pattern 4, and second most common differentiation pattern is 5. So Gleason pattern 4+5=9. They also mention previous Gleason sum 6 but not capture aggressive; the new findings are more severe. So we need the most severe lesion: that is the second targeted biopsy focus, with Gleason 4+5=9. The sample type: "biopsy" presumably, since it's a biopsy. Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+5=9".

We need to ensure the sample type allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. So "biopsy".

Thus JSON: { "Sampletype":"biopsy", "Malignancy":"yes", "Gleason":"4+5=9" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
