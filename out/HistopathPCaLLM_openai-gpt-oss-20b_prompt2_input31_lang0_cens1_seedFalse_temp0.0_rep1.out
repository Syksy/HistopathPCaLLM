analysisWe have to parse the statement. The statement: "Patient undergone routine check due to suspicious symptoms. Symptoms had increased, so after imaging necessary samples were taken. A clear technical failure in the first sample. Other samples contain suspicious findings, but they encompass only 5 % ot the original samples. Patient has other treatments regarding unrelated diagnosis, it is unclear if these could have had effect on the suspicious findings. Interpretation of tissue proved difficult, additional samples and treatment planning needed."

This is a histopathological statement? It's describing suspicious findings but not stating malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade. There's mention of suspicious findings, but no mention of malignant tumor or Gleason. So we consider not a valid histopathological statement. Therefore Sampletype: NA, Malignancy: NA, Gleason: NA.

But the instruction says: Return only results from most severe lesion. The statement is ambiguous. There's no malignant tumor.

Thus produce JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We must ensure correct JSON formatting.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
