analysisWe need to parse the given statement (Finnish language). Determine sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The statement: "Potilas on käynyt rutiineissa systeemibiopsiossa,... toista targetoitua biopsiaa... Toisessa biopsiapalassa... toisesta löytyykin...". So sample type is a biopsy. It seems from routine system biopsy and target biopsy. So sample type: "biopsy".

Second: Was there a malignancy? The statement mentions Gleason 3+3=6 minimal focus, later 4+5 (?) "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5"? Wait: They mention "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5". Means second most common growth pattern 5. So there is malignant tumor present. So "kyllä".

Third: Gleason class: They mention "3+3=6" minimal focus, later "matkalta laaja focus, jossa pääosin kasvutapaa 4." And "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5." So the major+minor sum? They didn't explicitly give sum but we can calculate: If major is 4, minor 5? Wait: They mention "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (main growth pattern 4). Then "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common growth pattern 5). So major=4, minor=5? Usually major is highest grade, minor is second highest. So major 5, minor 4? But they said main growth pattern 4, second most common 5. That is reversed: major 5, minor 4. So sum is 9. Another possibility: They might mean 4+5=9. So Gleason: "4+5=9" or "5+4=9". Which is correct? The instruction says "major+minor=sum" format. So major first. So likely "5+4=9". But they could also say "4+5=9". Which one is correct? The statement: "pääosin kasvutapaa 4" (main growth pattern 4). "toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5" (second most common growth pattern 5). So major grade 5, minor 4. So "5+4=9". Let's output "5+4=9".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

But check if the statement qualifies as a valid histopathological statement? There is mention of biopsy results, Gleason scoring. So yes. It is a valid histopathological statement. So we should produce structured data accordingly.

We need to ensure keys exactly: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason" as in examples. Output only JSON.

Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
```
