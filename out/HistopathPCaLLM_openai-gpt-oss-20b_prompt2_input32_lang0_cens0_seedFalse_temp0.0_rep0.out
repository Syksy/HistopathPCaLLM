analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a radical prostatectomy (RP). The sample type: "RP". Malignancy: yes? The statement describes the original multifocal adenocarcinoma of the prostate. So malignant tumor findings present. Gleason grade: The most severe lesion: the original prostate had Gleason 4+4 pattern observed particularly in the base of the prostate. That is Gleason 8. Also other patterns but 4+4 is the highest. So Gleason should be "4+4=8". According to allowed values: "major+minor=sum". So "4+4=8". So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check: We need only most severe lesion. Yes. The lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are clear, but malignant lesion is in prostate. So "yes". Sample type "RP". That should be correct.assistantfinal```json
