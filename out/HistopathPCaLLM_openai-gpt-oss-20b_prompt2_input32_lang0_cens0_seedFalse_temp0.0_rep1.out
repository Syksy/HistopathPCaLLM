analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological report. The fields:

1. Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The sample type in this case is RP (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP".

2. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". The report indicates the primary prostate had multifocal adenocarcinoma with Gleason patterns 4+4 etc. So there is malignant tumor. So "yes".

3. Gleason: "major+minor=sum" in form of whole numbers for malignant statements or "NA" for benign. For the most severe lesion. There are multiple patterns: 4+4 pattern observed particularly in the base. That's highest. Also 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The most severe is 4+4 -> sum 8. So Gleason: "4+4=8".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check no nested. That is correct.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}
```
