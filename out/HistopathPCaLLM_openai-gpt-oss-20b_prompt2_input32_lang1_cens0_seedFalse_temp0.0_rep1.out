analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish pathology statement. Determine sample type: The sample type could be biopsy, RP, TURP, or NA. The statement refers to a radical prostatectomy (radikaali prostatektomia) original sample, and then mentions separate samples: sample 1 (five lymph nodes), sample 2 (eight lymph nodes), samples 3 and 4 (seminovaginal? Actually "seminalivehikkelit" maybe "seminal vesicles"? not sure). The original tumor from prostate had Gleason 4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. The new lymph node samples are negative (0/5 and 0/8). The seminaalivehikkelit also negative. The question: "What is the sample's original type?" We need to decide for the overall statement: The main sample is from radical prostatectomy (RP). So sample type: "RP". Malignancy: Are there malignant findings? The statement says the original prostate had multifocal adenocarcinoma with various Gleason scores. So yes, there were malignant findings. But the new samples (lymph nodes and seminaalivehikkelit) are negative. But the overall statement should reflect the worst lesion. The instruction: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa" meaning only the worst lesion results should be returned, and the result should not consist of nested structures. So we need to return the worst malignancy among all samples? The instruction says "vain pahimman leesion tulokset" which in Finnish means "only the worst lesion results". So we need to choose the worst lesion among all described. The worst lesion is the original prostate tumor with Gleason 4+4 sum 8 (highest). But the statement also says the lymph nodes are negative and seminaalivehikkelit negative, so the worst malignant lesion remains the prostate tumor. So we should return sample type "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy "kyllä". Gleason "4+4=8" (since they mention Gleason 4+4). However, the statement also includes other Gleason components: 3+3, 3+4, 4+3. But we need to choose the worst (highest sum). So 4+4=8 is the worst. So return Gleason "4+4=8". Ensure JSON. Also if sample type is from radical prostatectomy, then "RP". So final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+4=8"
}

Check instructions: The sampletype values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct. Malignancy: "kyllä" or "ei" or "NA". So "kyllä". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA". So "4+4=8". That seems correct. Ensure no nested structures. Provide only this JSON.assistantfinal```json
