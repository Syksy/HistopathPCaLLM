analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: statement: "Radical prostatectomy preparate started normally according to protocol.... Tumor has penetrated the capsule (estimate T3b).... One finding (1/4, N1) in lymph nodes in processed macro sections. No malignant findings in seminal vessels." So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes, because tumor present, capsule penetrated, lymph node positive. Gleason grade: "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3." That indicates Gleason pattern 3+4 or 4+3. The most severe lesion: we need to choose the higher sum? Both sums are 7. But we need major+minor=7. Which one? Usually the dominant pattern is used; but here both 3+4 and 4+3. The most severe: 4+3 results in major 4, minor 3, sum 7. But 3+4 also sum 7. But major+minor=7. We need to output "4+3=7" perhaps. According to guidelines, if both are present, choose the one with higher major component: 4+3. So output Gleason "4+3=7". Malignancy yes.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Return only that.assistantfinal```json
