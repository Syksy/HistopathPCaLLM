analysisWe need to parse the statement, identify the sample type: "Radical prostatectomy preparate started normally according to protocol." That indicates the sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes? The statement says tumor has penetrated capsule, growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3. So malignant. Gleason: We need the most severe lesion. The statement gives two patterns: 3+4/4+3. Which is more severe? Typically Gleason score is sum of primary and secondary. 3+4 = 7, 4+3 = 7 as well. Both are 7. Which to choose? The statement says "growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3". It might mean there are multiple cores with patterns. The highest grade is 4+3? Both 7. But maybe they want "4+3=7"? But the example: "Gleason grades 4 and 3, resulting in a sum of 4+3=7." So we need to format as "4+3=7". Which of the two? Possibly the more aggressive is 4+3 because pattern 4 primary. So choose "4+3=7". So output:

{
"Sampletype":"RP",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Also mention that lymph nodes positive but that doesn't change. So final JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",

  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
