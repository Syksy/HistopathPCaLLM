analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol. Pathological findings vary, possibly due to different sampling locations. View specific information from additional details of the reports. Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed samples. No malignant findings in seminal vehicles."

We need to identify sample type ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA"). The statement mentions "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol." That does not specify sample type. "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed samples." That could be lymph nodes, but sample type is not specified. "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." That refers to seminal vesicles. There's no mention of biopsy or RP or TURP. So sample type likely "NA".

Malignancy: The statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." So malignant findings are "no". It does not mention malignant tumor elsewhere. So Malignancy = "no".

Gleason: For benign statements, we should use "NA". So Gleason = "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But they said only results from most severe lesion should be returned. There are no malignant lesions. So "no" is correct.

Thus answer.assistantfinal```json

  "Gleason": "NA"
}
