analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol. Pathological findings vary, possibly due to different sampling locations. View specific information from additional details of the reports. Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed samples. No malignant findings in seminal vehicles."

We need to extract structured data: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".

We have no explicit sample type. The statement says "Collected samples". Could be unspecified. So likely "NA".

Malignancy: "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." So no malignant tumor findings. So "no". It says possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes. But not sure if malignant. It says possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes. That is ambiguous. But we have explicit "No malignant findings". So likely Malignancy = "no".

Gleason: Since no malignant findings, "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Let's produce that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
