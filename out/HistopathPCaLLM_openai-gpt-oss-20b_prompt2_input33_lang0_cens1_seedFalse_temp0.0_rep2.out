analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says: "Collected samples are processed normally according to protocol. Pathological findings vary, possibly due to different sampling locations. View specific information from additional details of the reports. Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes in processed samples. No malignant findings in seminal vehicles."

We need to determine sample type. The statement doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says collected samples processed normally. So sample type is NA.

Malignancy: It says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." There's no mention of malignant findings elsewhere. It says possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes. But no malignant findings. So Malignancy: NA? Allowed values "yes", "no" or "NA". Since we don't know if malignant, but "No malignant findings" suggests "no". But the context: "Possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes" could be malignant or benign. However the statement says "No malignant findings in seminal vehicles." That is a specific statement of no malignant findings in those. But overall, no clear malignant tumor. I'd set "no" as Malignancy.

Gleason: Since no malignant tumor, Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if "no" is allowed. Yes. So final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
