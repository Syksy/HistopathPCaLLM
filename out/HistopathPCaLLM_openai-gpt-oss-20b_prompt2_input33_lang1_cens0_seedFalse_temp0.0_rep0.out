analysisWe need to parse the Finnish text. Determine sample type: "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti on käynnistetty..." This seems to be a radical prostatectomy specimen (RP). Sample type should be "RP". Malignancy: Are there malignant findings? The text says "Kapselin reuna-alueella kasvutapa vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3, ja tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia (arvio T3b)". That indicates malignant adenocarcinoma with Gleason 3+4 and 4+3? Actually says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3" maybe meaning Gleason 3+4 and 4+3? So malignancy present. So "kyllä". Gleason: Reported Gleason: 3+4/4+3? The format should be major+minor=sum. But it's ambiguous: "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3" maybe they mean there are two components: 3+4=7 and 4+3=7. Usually the Gleason score is 3+4=7 and 4+3=7? The sum is 7. The format "major+minor=sum". But we need to give a single sum. But the text indicates "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". Could interpret as two Gleason patterns: 3+4 (major 3, minor 4) and 4+3. The standard is major pattern 4, minor 3? Actually pattern 3+4 means major 3, minor 4? Wait, Gleason score is usually major+minor. So 3+4 = 7, major pattern 3, minor 4. 4+3 = 7, major 4 minor 3. But the overall Gleason is 3+4=7, but the text says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". Perhaps they mean two patterns: 3+4 and 4+3. But we need to output a single Gleason in format "major+minor=sum". Should we pick 3+4=7 or 4+3=7? The text indicates both are present. The overall Gleason sum is 7. They want "major+minor=sum". But we need to choose major and minor. Which one is the major? Usually major is the higher pattern. But in 3+4, major is 3? That contradicts. Actually in Gleason scoring, the first number is the most common pattern (major), the second is the second most common pattern (minor). So if 3+4, major is 3, minor 4. If 4+3, major is 4, minor 3. So overall, the major pattern is 4, minor 3? But both patterns are present, so the major overall is 4. So overall Gleason is 4+3=7. So we can output "4+3=7". That matches the format.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any alternative: The sample is a radical prostatectomy. Malignancy yes. Gleason 3+4/4+3 indicates both. But we need one sum. The correct is 7. Should we output "3+4=7"? They asked for major+minor=sum. The major pattern is 4. So "4+3=7". I'll use that.

Return JSON.assistantfinal{
