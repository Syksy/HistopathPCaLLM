analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text. It's a histopathology report. Determine:

1. Sample type: choices "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The report says "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti on käynnistetty normaalisti protokollan mukaisesti." This suggests radical prostatectomy (RP). "Radikaalipostatetoktomian" is radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype: "RP".

2. Malignancy? Are there malignant findings? Yes, the report mentions tumor has penetrated capsule (T3b) and Gleason pattern 3+4/4+3. So malignant. So "kyllä".

3. Gleason: The report says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". This seems ambiguous: "3+4/4+3" maybe meaning 3+4 and 4+3? But usually Gleason is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. The text says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". That might mean there are two patterns: 3+4 and 4+3? The typical reporting is major+minor= sum. Which one is major? Usually higher pattern is minor? Actually Gleason grading: major pattern is highest grade, minor is second highest. So if patterns 3+4, major 4 minor 3 sum 7. If patterns 4+3, major 4 minor 3 sum 7. So both give 7. But the phrase "3+4/4+3" maybe indicates both patterns exist. We need to pick the "reported Gleason class". The guidelines say output "major+minor=sum" for malignant. So we could output "4+3=7" (major 4 minor 3). But if there are two, maybe we choose the higher? The most malignant pattern would be 4+3. It's typical to present as 4+3=7. So I'll output "4+3=7". 

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any nuance: The text also mentions "Makroleikkeissä ajetuissa imusolmukkeissa yksi löydös (1/4, N1) mutta seminaalivehikkeleissä ei maligneja löydöksiä." It's about lymph nodes. But malignancy present in primary tumor. So yes.

Return only JSON.assistantfinal```json
