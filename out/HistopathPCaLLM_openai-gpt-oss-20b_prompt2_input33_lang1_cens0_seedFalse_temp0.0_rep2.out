analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text: "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti on käynnistetty normaalisti protokollan mukaisesti. Kapselin reuna-alueella kasvutapa vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3, ja tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia (arvio T3b). Katso tarkemmat raportin lisätiedot yksityiskohdista. Makroleikkeissä ajetuissa imusolmukkeissa yksi löydös (1/4, N1) mutta seminaalivehikkeleissä ei maligneja löydöksiä."

We need to output JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype: allowed "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The sample type is described as "Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti" which likely refers to radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: Are there malignant findings? The text says "tuuuri on läpäissyt kapselia" indicating malignancy. Also Gleason pattern described: 3+4/4+3. This indicates presence of malignancy. So Malignancy: "kyllä". Gleason: need "major+minor=sum" format. They give "3+4/4+3" which is ambiguous: maybe they mean "3+4" major 4 minor 3 sum 7? Actually Gleason 3+4 is 7. But they also list 4+3. So maybe they mean there are both patterns? But typical Gleason score is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. They might be describing variation. But we need to report a single Gleason class. The instruction says: "Mikä oli raportoitu Gleason-luokka (sallitut arvot'major+minor=sum' muodossa kokonaislukuina pahanlaatuisille löydöksille ja 'NA' hyvänlaatuisille löydöksille)." So we need to output the reported Gleason class. The text says "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3". That could be interpreted as "3+4/4+3" meaning "major 4 minor 3". Usually major is the most common pattern? They might be using slash to indicate variation. But we can choose the most significant: maybe "4+3=7" or "3+4=7". In prostate pathology, the major pattern is the most common. If they say "3+4/4+3" maybe they mean both are present. But we need a single value. Which to choose? The text earlier: "Kapselin reuna-alueella kasvutapa vaihtelee Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3" So "vaihtelee" meaning it varies. Hard to pick. But likely the overall Gleason is 3+4=7 (since 3+4 is the more common). But the slash indicates maybe it is 4+3? Actually 3+4/4+3 means the tumor has both major 3 minor 4 and major 4 minor 3? Typically you pick the most frequent pattern as major. If they wrote "3+4/4+3" maybe they mean "3+4" with "4+3" variant? It's unclear. But we need to produce something. We could output "3+4=7" or "4+3=7". Or maybe combine as "3+4/4+3=7"? That is not allowed. The format is "major+minor=sum". So we need one triple. Let's choose "3+4=7" as the reported Gleason. Because the slash suggests variation but we choose the first. Or we might mention "4+3=7" because typical major pattern is the one with highest grade. If 4 is the highest, major is 4. So maybe "4+3=7". Let's choose "4+3=7". But we need to decide. The phrase "Gleason tyypeittäin 3+4/4+3" indicates both types? But I'd lean to "4+3=7" being major 4 minor 3 sum 7. But the slash indicates maybe they are writing both major/minor combos. But we can choose "4+3=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check criteria: Sampletype is one of allowed. Malignancy yes. Gleason is correct format. Ensure no nested structure. That's good.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
