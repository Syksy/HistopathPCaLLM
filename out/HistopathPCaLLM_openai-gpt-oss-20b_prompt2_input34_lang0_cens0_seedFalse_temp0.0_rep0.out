analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement. We need to determine sample type: "resection" likely radical prostatectomy? The statement: "The presented sample is a resection weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr." That refers to a resection. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "RP" stands for radical prostatectomy. So Sampletype: "RP".

Were there malignant tumor findings? The statement says "Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma. Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen, but no malignities." So yes, no malignancy. So Malignancy: "no".

What is the reported Gleason grade? For benign statements, it's "NA". So Gleason: "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype":"RP",
 "Malignancy":"no",
 "Gleason":"NA"
}

Double-check: Should we put "NA" for sample type if ambiguous? But "resection" indicates RP. So yes. Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
