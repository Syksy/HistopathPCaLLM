analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr... Histologically can be seen that glands are very close to each other, partial cribriform structures noted. Findings do not indicate prostatic. Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen."

Thus sample type? It says "presented sample" but not specifying biopsy, RP, TURP. Could be "NA". Malignancy? Findings do not indicate prostatic malignancy. So "no". Gleason? Since not malignant, "NA". So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But wait: "Malignancy" allowed values "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no" is allowed. Sampletype allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "NA". Gleason: "NA". That matches.assistantfinal```json
