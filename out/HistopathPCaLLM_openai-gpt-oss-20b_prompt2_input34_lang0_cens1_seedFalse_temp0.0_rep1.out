analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The presented sample is weighing 7.5gr, which has been prepared into six tissue casettes weighing total 7gr. Histologically can be seen that glands are very close to each other, partial cribriform structures noted. Findings do not indicate prostatic. Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen."

We need to determine sample type: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement indicates "presented sample" but not specifying biopsy type. It just says tissue casettes, likely from a radical prostatectomy? But there's no mention of RP. Could be a resection. The sample type may be "NA" because not specified. According to instructions, only return most severe lesion. There's no malignant tumor findings. The statement says "Findings do not indicate prostatic." "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." So malignant? No. So Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". We can say "no". Gleason: "NA" because no malignant. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check sample type: If it's a prostate sample but not specified biopsy or RP or TURP. The instructions: "What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA")." So if not identified, use NA.

Thus final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
