analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a sample weighing 7.5gr, six tissue casettes. Histologically: glands close, partial cribriform structures noted. Findings do not indicate prostatic carcinoma? It says "Findings do not indicate prostatic." The phrase "prostatic." truncated. Then "Hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation seen." So it's benign. So Sampletype: we need to determine sample type. The statement says "presented sample". It doesn't say biopsy, RP, TURP. Might be "NA". Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". So JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}.

But check instructions: sample type allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So NA is fine. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no". Gleason: for benign statements "NA". So output accordingly.assistantfinal```json
