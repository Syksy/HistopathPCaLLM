analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement. Let's read:

"Samples 1-6 are representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe. One site on the left side shows small high-grade PIN-changes. No perineural invasion. Some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia. No signs of carcinoma."

We need to produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We need "most severe lesion". This statement indicates no carcinoma, only high-grade PIN (pre-cancerous) and hyperplasia. So no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA" because benign.

Sampletype: Is it biopsy? Yes, "representative prostate biopsies". So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We should output only JSON. Ensure no extra.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
