analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples 1-6 are representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe. One site on the left side shows small high-grade PIN-changes. No perineural invasion. Some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia. No signs of carcinoma."

We need to produce JSON with keys: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We identify sample type: "biopsy" because it's prostate biopsies. Malignancy: "no" because no carcinoma. Gleason: "NA" because benign.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"biopsy","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}.

Check allowed values: sample type allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "biopsy" is correct. Malignancy allowed: "yes", "no" or "NA". Good. Gleason: if malignant, provide "major+minor=sum". If benign, "NA". So "NA".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
