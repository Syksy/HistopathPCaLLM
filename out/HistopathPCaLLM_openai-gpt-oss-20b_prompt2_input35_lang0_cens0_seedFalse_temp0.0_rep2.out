analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples 1-6 are representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe. One site on the left side shows small high-grade PIN-changes. No perineural invasion. Some tissue formations on the right that represent hyperplasia. No signs of carcinoma."

We need to produce structured data for the most severe lesion. Here the lesions: small high-grade PIN changes. No carcinoma. PIN is not malignant tumor. So malignant findings? No. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: Since no malignant tumor, use "NA". Sample type: "biopsy" (since prostate biopsies). So JSON: { "Sampletype":"biopsy", "Malignancy":"no", "Gleason":"NA" }

Check if any malignant tumor? No. So done.assistantfinal```json
