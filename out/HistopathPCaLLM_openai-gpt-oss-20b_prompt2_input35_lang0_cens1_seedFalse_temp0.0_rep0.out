analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about samples from left and right lobe. One site on left shows small high-grade PIN-changes. No perineural invasion. Some tissue formations on right represent hyperplasia. Mixed findings can be observed.

We need to produce structured JSON with fields:

- Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement does not specify sample type; it's not a biopsy, not RP, not TURP. So "NA".

- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement contains high-grade PIN changes: PIN is prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, which is a precursor lesion but not malignant. Hyperplasia is benign. So no malignant tumor findings. So "no".

- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements, or "NA" for benign statements. Since there's no malignant tumor, we put "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if any nuance: high-grade PIN is considered pre-malignant but not carcinoma. So not malignant. So answer is above.

Return JSON.

  "Gleason": "NA"
}
