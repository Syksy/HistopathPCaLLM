analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing a prostate specimen: "preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia. No signs of malignity or inflammation."

We must determine sample type: it's likely a "RP" (radical prostatectomy) because it's a whole prostate prepared. It says "preparate" (maybe "prepare", meaning specimen). Not a biopsy or TURP. So sample type: "RP".

Malignancy: "No signs of malignity or inflammation." So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: None, so "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Yes. Malignancy: yes/no/NA. Yes. Gleason: major+minor=sum for malignant statements or NA. So NA.

Return that.assistantfinal```json
