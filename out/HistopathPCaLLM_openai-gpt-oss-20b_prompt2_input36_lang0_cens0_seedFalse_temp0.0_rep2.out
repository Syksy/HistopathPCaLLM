analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a description of a prostate specimen? It says: "The preparate weighs 80gr, sized approx 7 x 6 x 5 cm. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia. No signs of malignity or inflammation."

It doesn't mention sample type explicitly, but "preparate" likely refers to radical prostatectomy (RP). But we can't be sure. The statement says "preparate weighs 80gr" which is typical for a radical prostatectomy. "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes" again typical for RP. So sample type: "RP". Malignancy: no signs of malignancy, so "no". Gleason: since no malignancy, "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA" for sample type. Good. Malignancy: yes/no/NA. Good. Gleason: major+minor=sum or NA. Good.

Thus final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
