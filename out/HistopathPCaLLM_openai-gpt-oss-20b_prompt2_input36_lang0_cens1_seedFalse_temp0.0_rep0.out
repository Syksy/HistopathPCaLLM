analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably."

This appears to be benign findings: nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia. No mention of malignant tumor, no Gleason grade. Sample type? Not specified. Could be prostate? But sample type likely "NA" because we don't know if biopsy, RP, TURP. The statement doesn't say. So Sampletype: "NA". Malignancy: "no" because no malignant tumor. Gleason: "NA" because benign. But the instruction says "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." So we produce JSON with those three keys. "Sampletype": "NA", "Malignancy": "no", "Gleason": "NA".

Double-check: Malignancy allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". Since benign, we set "no". Gleason: "NA". Sampletype: "NA" because not specified. That matches.

Return JSON.assistantfinal{"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"no","Gleason":"NA"}
