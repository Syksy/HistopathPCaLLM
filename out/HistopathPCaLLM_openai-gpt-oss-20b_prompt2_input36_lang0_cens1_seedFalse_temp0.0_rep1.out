analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably."

We must output JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We must decide sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement: "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." Not explicit whether it's biopsy or RP. Could be a biopsy, but not clear. It says macroscopically nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia. No mention of radical prostatectomy (RP) or TURP. So likely biopsy. But the statement does not explicitly say "biopsy" or "RP". According to instruction: "If not clear, set to NA." The allowed values are: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So if ambiguous, choose NA.

Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement mentions hyperplasia, not malignant. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: There's no Gleason grade for benign. So "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But check instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". If no malignant, then "Malignancy": "no" and Gleason: "NA". Sample type ambiguous => NA.

Thus final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
