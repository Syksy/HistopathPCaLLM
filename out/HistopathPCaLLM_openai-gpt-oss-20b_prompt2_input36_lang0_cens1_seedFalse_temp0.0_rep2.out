analysisWe need to parse the given statement: "Sample size and weight is normal. Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes. Macroscopically can be seen nodular hyperplasia, microscopically epithelial hyperplasia, but was not assessed reliably."

This is a statement about prostate histopathology. It's describing nodular hyperplasia and epithelial hyperplasia, which are benign lesions. No malignant tumor findings. No Gleason grade. The sample type? It says "Prepared 8 macro casettes and 5 regular cassettes." That suggests this was a prostatectomy specimen? It does not explicitly say "biopsy" or "RP" or "TURP". The sample type is not specified. So we may set Sampletype: "NA". Malignancy: "no" or "NA"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since there are no malignant findings, we should set "no". Gleason: "NA".

Thus:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Wait, but is "no" allowed? Yes, allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no" is fine.

Check if any malignant statement is present. No. So "no".

Thus final answer JSON.
