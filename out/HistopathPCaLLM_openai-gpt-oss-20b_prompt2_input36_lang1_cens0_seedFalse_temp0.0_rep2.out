analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish statement. It describes a specimen: prepaatti (preparation) weight 80 grams, size, etc. It's a macroscopic and microscopic description: macroscopically sees nodule hyperplasia, microscopically sees epitheli hyperplasia. No malignancy or inflammation found. No mention of prostate biopsy or RP or TURP. It's unspecified. The statement is about a preparation presumably from a prostate. But the sample type: The allowed values are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since it's not a biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) but we don't know. Could be a prostate specimen but not a biopsy. So likely NA. Malignancy: no malignant findings: "ei". Gleason: since no malignancy, "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But check instructions: For malignancy: allowed values "kyllä", "ei" or "NA". In this case it's present: "Maligniteettia tai inflammaatiota ei löydy." So "ei". Sampletype: It's not a biopsy, not RP, not TURP: so "NA". Gleason: no malignancy: "NA".

Thus the JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "ei",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
