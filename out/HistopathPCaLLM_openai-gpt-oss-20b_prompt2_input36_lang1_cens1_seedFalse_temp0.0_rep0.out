analysisWe need to parse the Finnish text. The sample is a histopathological report. We need to determine:

1) Sample type: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA".

2) Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", or "NA".

3) Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA"

We only return the worst lesion results. In this report: "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset. Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia. Makroskooppisesti tutkittaessa näytteistä löydettiin nodulaarista hyperplasiaa, mikroskooppisesti epiteelin hyperplasiaa, mutta ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan."

Interpretation: Sample type? The sample seems to be a prostate biopsy? They said "8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia" meaning they prepared 8 macro-sets and 5 normal sets. It might be a biopsy. But not necessarily. It doesn't say "biopsy" explicitly. The sample type could be "biopsy" if it's a biopsy. But no mention of radical prostatectomy or TURP. So likely "biopsy". However the text says "Näytteen paino ja koko tyypilliset" meaning "Sample weight and size typical." "Valmistettiin 8 makrokasettia ja 5 normaalia kasettia." That sounds like a biopsy. I think we can classify as "biopsy" because it's a tissue sample taken for histology. There's no mention of "radical prostatectomy" or "TURP". So "biopsy".

Malignancy: They found nodular hyperplasia, epithelial hyperplasia, but could not assess reliably. They didn't find malignancy. So "ei" for malignancy? They said "ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan" i.e., "could not reliably assess" but they didn't mention cancer. So we might say "ei" because no malignancies reported. But the presence of hyperplasia. But it's not malignant. So "ei".

Gleason: No Gleason reported because no malignancy. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "ei",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But the instructions say: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset" but we only have one sample. So fine.

Edge: If the sample type is ambiguous, we might use "NA". But I think "biopsy" is appropriate. The instructions: "Mikä on näytteen alkuperäinen tyyppi (sallitut arvot "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" tai "NA")". The sample appears to be a biopsy. So "biopsy".

Thus final answer.assistantfinal```json
