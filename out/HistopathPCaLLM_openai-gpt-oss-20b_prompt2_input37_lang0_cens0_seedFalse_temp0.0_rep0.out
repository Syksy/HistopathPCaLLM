analysisWe need to parse the statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in typical places. Findings indicate hyperplasia."

We need to identify sample type: The statement says "electrosection chippings" - that's probably a TURP? Actually "electrosection" refers to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). So sample type likely "TURP". But the allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "TURP" is an allowed value.

Malignancy: The findings indicate hyperplasia, not malignant. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: For benign statements, "NA".

Thus JSON: { "Sampletype":"TURP", "Malignancy":"no", "Gleason":"NA" }

Check that we only return the most severe lesion: this is benign only. So yes.

Return JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
