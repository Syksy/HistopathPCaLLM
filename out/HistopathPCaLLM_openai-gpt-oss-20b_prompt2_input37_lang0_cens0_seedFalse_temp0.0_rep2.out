analysisWe need to parse the statement: "7g of electrosection chippings as preparate. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components. Minor inflammation in typical places. Findings indicate hyperplasia."

It is a histopathological statement. We need to identify sample type: likely "TURP" or "biopsy"? The text says "electrosection chippings as preparate." That sounds like a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) sample. But could also be "biopsy" but electrosection is typical of TURP. Sample type: "TURP".

Malignancy: The findings indicate hyperplasia, not malignant. So "no".

Gleason: Because malignant? It's benign, so "NA".

Return JSON with Sampletype: "TURP", Malignancy: "no", Gleason: "NA".

We must ensure allowed values. Sampletype allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Use "TURP".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
