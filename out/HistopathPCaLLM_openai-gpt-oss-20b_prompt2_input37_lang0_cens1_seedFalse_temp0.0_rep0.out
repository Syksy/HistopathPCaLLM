analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Less than half of the total sample material preparated. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents. Minor inflammation in places. Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week."

We need to determine: Sample type: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement didn't specify. It just says "prostate tissue" but no sample type. So likely NA.

Malignancy: The statement says "partial nodular glandcomponents" and "Minor inflammation" but no mention of malignant tumor. So we should say "NA" or "no"? The prompt says: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")." If no malignant tumor, we set "no". But if uncertain, maybe "NA"? The statement says partial nodular gland components, but not malignant. So likely "no" malignancy. But we need to see if the guidelines say that if no malignant tumor findings, set "no". I'd set "no".

Gleason: only if malignant. Since no malignant, we set "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But we need to check: The sample type allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since unspecified, "NA".
