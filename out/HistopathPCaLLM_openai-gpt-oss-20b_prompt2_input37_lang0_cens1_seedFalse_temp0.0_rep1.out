analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing a histopathological exam: "Less than half of the total sample material preparated. Histological examination reveals prostate tissue with partial nodular glandcomponents. Minor inflammation in places. Further examination was not possible at this time, and samples are going to be examined further next week." This seems like a negative or non-diagnostic? It mentions "prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components" and "minor inflammation". There's no mention of malignancy or Gleason score. So we should return "Sampletype": "NA" maybe because no sample type given? It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. So NA. "Malignancy": "NA" because not present. "Gleason": "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Return that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
