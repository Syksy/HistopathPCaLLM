analysisWe need to parse the Finnish statement. The statement: "Preparaattina 7g elektrosektiolastuja. Histologisesti nähtään prostatakudosta, jossa osittain lisääntyneitä kyhmyisiä rauhaskomponentteja. Paikoittain vähäistä inflammaatiota kuten tavallisesti. Löydös siis hyperplasia." This says: Prepared 7g electrosurgical samples. Histologically seen prostate tissue, where partially increased clumpy calm component. Occasionally mild inflammation as usual. Finding is hyperplasia. So it's not malignant. The sample type: The statement refers to "preparaattina 7g elektrosektiolastuja." That suggests it is a radical prostatectomy specimen? Actually "electrosectomy" maybe radical? It says "preparaati" meaning specimen. "Electrosurgical specimens" likely from a TURP? Usually TURP yields electro-thermally cauterized tissue, but they call them "electrosectomy" (TURP). But the sample type options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement likely refers to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate). But we need to be careful. The sample type is "TURP" as it is electrosurgical tissues. So Sampletype: "TURP". Malignancy: "ei" (no). Gleason: "NA" because no malignancy. According to the instructions: Provide JSON with keys: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". So JSON: { "Sampletype": "TURP", "Malignancy": "ei", "Gleason": "NA" }. Provide only that.assistantfinal```json
