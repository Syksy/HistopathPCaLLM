analysisWe need to parse the statement:

"Representative needle biopsies as samples. Total length approx 111 mm. In histological examination, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found. No suspected malignity."

We need to provide:

- Sampletype: allowed "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "Representative needle biopsies as samples." So sample type is biopsy. So "biopsy".

- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". It says no suspected malignity. So "no".

- Gleason: For malignant statements use major+minor=sum. For benign statements use "NA". Since it's benign, use "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return as JSON. Ensure no nested. Ok.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
