analysisWe need to parse statement. The statement: "Representative needle biopsies as samples. Total length approx 111 mm. In histological examination, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found. No suspected malignity."

Thus sample type: "biopsy" (representative needle biopsies). Malignancy: "no" (No suspected malignity). Gleason: NA (benign). So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We must ensure keys exactly as specified: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Provide JSON. That is all.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
