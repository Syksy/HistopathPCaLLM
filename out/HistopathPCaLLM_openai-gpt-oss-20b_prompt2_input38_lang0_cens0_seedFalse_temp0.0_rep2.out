analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Representative needle biopsies as samples. Total length approx 111 mm. In histological examination, hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found. No suspected malignity."

We have sample type: "needle biopsies" -> that matches "biopsy". So Sampletype = "biopsy".

Malignancy: "No suspected malignity" -> no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy = "no".

Gleason: Since benign, Gleason = "NA".

Return JSON with those fields. Ensure no nested. Provide exactly keys: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Use correct values.assistantfinal```json
