analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Representative samples are collected. Total measurements provided in millimeters. In histological examination, some finding including hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation was found."

We must produce structured data with fields:

- Sampletype: possible values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA".
- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA".
- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements, or "NA" for benign.

We only consider the most severe lesion. The statement describes hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. This is benign, no malignant findings. There's no mention of sample type (like biopsy, RP, TURP). It says "Representative samples are collected" but not specifying. So Sampletype would be "NA". Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA" because benign.

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to output JSON. Ensure field names exactly as in example: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Return only JSON, no extra text.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
