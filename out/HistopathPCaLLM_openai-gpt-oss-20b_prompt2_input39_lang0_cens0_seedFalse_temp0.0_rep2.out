analysisWe need to parse the statement. Sample type: It's a prostatectomy preparate, so sample type "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes, tumor found. Gleason grade: reported as 7. The statement says "Found Gleason 3 (major) and 4 differentiation stages... Gleason grade is 7". So Gleason: "3+4=7". We should produce JSON with fields: "Sampletype": "RP", "Malignancy": "yes", "Gleason": "3+4=7". Ensure no extra spaces. Should we use "RP" exactly. Yes. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
