analysisWe need to parse the given statement. The statement:

"Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations. But it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings. Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

We have to determine sample type: The statement doesn't mention biopsy, RP, TURP. So "NA".

Malignancy: not clear. Could not assess. So "NA".

Gleason: cannot assess. So "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure keys match exactly: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Use double quotes. Provide as JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
