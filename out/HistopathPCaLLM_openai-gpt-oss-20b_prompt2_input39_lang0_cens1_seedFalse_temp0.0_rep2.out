analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Sample under examination has size of 20. Some slices extracted, remaining tissue run according to normal routine. Microscopic inspection conducted at 3 locations. But it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings. Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point."

We need to determine sample type. The statement doesn't explicitly say biopsy, RP, TURP. So sample type is "NA". Malignancy: not clear whether malignant or benign. So "NA". Gleason: cannot be assessed. So "NA". Return JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Use "NA" for each.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Ensure JSON format.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
