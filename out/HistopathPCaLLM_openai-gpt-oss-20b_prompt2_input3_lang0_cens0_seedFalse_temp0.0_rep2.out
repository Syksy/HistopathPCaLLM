analysisWe need to parse the statement:

"Sample consists of 12.3g of prostate chippings. The material is started on one casette. In histologial inspection, spotted chronic inflammation is apparently, and the material gives an overall impression of stromal hyperplasia. Nothing indicating malignancy is found."

We need to output JSON with fields:

Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". It's "sample consists of... prostate chippings" - likely a biopsy? "chippings" suggests a biopsy. So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: "yes", "no", or "NA". The statement says nothing indicating malignancy is found. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: if malignant, provide major+minor=sum. If benign, "NA". Since no malignancy, Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Yes.assistantfinal```json
