analysisWe need to parse this statement. Determine sample type: The sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, done in a single run. It's likely a radical prostatectomy (RP). But the statement doesn't explicitly say "radical prostatectomy" or "RP". It just says "primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material". That could be a specimen from RP. Sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Without explicit mention, maybe "NA". Because we can't confirm. The statement says "primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material" - that's typical of a radical prostatectomy specimen. But we can't be sure. Usually pathology reports say "prostatectomy specimen". But "primary sample" is ambiguous. There's no mention of biopsy or TURP. So maybe "RP" is appropriate. But guidelines: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". But there's no malignant tumor findings. There's inflammation, burn artefacts, nothing conclusive. So malignant tumor findings: "no" or "NA"? The statement says "nothing conclusive may be derived". So no malignant tumor findings. We should set "Malignancy": "no". Gleason: "NA" because no malignant tumor. Sampletype: maybe "RP". However, risk: If we guess incorrectly, we might produce wrong. The safe is "NA". But the sample is a primary sample containing a lot of prostate material. That suggests a prostatectomy specimen. The instructions: "What is the original sample type (allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA")". We must choose one. The sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, done in a single run. That is typical of a RP (the entire prostate). So I'd choose "RP". Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA".
