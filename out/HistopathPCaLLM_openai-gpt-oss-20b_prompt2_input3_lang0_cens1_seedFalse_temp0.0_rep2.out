analysisWe need to parse the statement: "The primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material, which is done in a single run. In histological inspection, some inflammation is apparent, but burn artefacts prevent detailed examination of the tissue material. Thus nothing conclusive may be derived from this run."

We need to identify sample type: allowed "biopsy", "RP" (radical prostatectomy), "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "primary sample contains over a dozen grams of prostate material... done in a single run". That might imply a surgical specimen, maybe radical prostatectomy. But it's unclear. It says "primary sample" not "biopsy". Over a dozen grams of prostate material could be a radical prostatectomy specimen. But the text says "burn artefacts prevent detailed examination". That might be a whole organ or a large specimen. In pathology context, "primary sample" could be a specimen from radical prostatectomy. So sample type likely "RP". But we need to be cautious. If we can't determine, we set NA. But the instructions say if not a valid histopathological statement, set all NA. But is it a valid histopathological statement? It says nothing conclusive may be derived. So there is no mention of malignant tumor findings or Gleason. So we should set "Malignancy": "no" or "NA"? The instruction: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")". If nothing conclusive, maybe "NA"? But since we can't determine if malignant or not, but we might still say "no" because no malignant tumor findings reported. The statement indicates nothing conclusive, but doesn't explicitly say no malignant tumor. I think "no" is maybe appropriate? However, the guidelines: "If no malignant tumor findings, set "no"". But if the statement is ambiguous, maybe "NA". The statement says "nothing conclusive may be derived". That means we cannot determine presence or absence of malignant tumor. So "NA" for Malignancy. Similarly Gleason: NA. Sampletype: maybe "NA" or "RP"? The sample seems like a whole organ: "primary sample... over a dozen grams of prostate material". That could be a radical prostatectomy. But sometimes a prostatectomy yields ~200 grams. So 12 grams is small. But maybe it's a core? But it's not a core, it's a single run, maybe a "biopsy"? But there is no mention of "core". The phrase "over a dozen grams of prostate material" suggests a larger specimen. But "primary sample" ambiguous. I'd lean "NA" to be safe, as it's not clearly a biopsy, TURP, or RP. Might be a gross specimen. The instruction says only those four allowed values; if none match, use NA. So we set Sampletype: "NA". Malignancy: "NA". Gleason: "NA".

Thus final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
