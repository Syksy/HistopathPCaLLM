analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing shaving material, histological exam reveals hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation, no atypical or invasive epithelial growth, summary benign prostate hyperplasia. So sample type? It's from shaving material. The sample type options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Shaving material is not typical of these. Could be radical prostatectomy (RP). But shaving material could be from TURP? Shaving material is typical of TURP, but it's not the entire prostate. But the typical sample type for TURP is "TURP". However the term "shaving material" is often used for TURP. The statement says "The shaving material weighs approx 8.9g, approx 5g set on eight casettes. Histological examination reveals hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation. No atypical or invasive epithelial growth. SUMMARY: Benign prostate hyperplasia". So it's presumably TURP. So sample type "TURP".

Malignancy: no malignant tumor findings. So "no".

Gleason: benign, so "NA".

Return JSON with those fields. Ensure keys exactly "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Use allowed values. The sample type is "TURP". So:

{
"Sampletype": "TURP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "TURP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
