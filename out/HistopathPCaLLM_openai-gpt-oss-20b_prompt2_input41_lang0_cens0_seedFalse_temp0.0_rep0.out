analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a histopathological statement.

The statement: "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe. Sample 3 (left apex) shows little chronic inflammation. Left side also shows in samples 1 and 2 atrophied glands with remaining chronic inflammation. No signs of prostate cancer in the material."

We need to produce a JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We need to identify the sample type: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA".

The text says: "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe." So the sample type is "biopsy".

Were there malignant tumor findings? The statement says "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So malignancy: "no".

What is the reported Gleason grade? For benign statements, we should put "NA". Because there is no malignant statement.

Thus output:

{
"Sampletype":"biopsy",
"Malignancy":"no",
"Gleason":"NA"
}

We should ensure keys exactly as in example: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Should not have nested structures.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
