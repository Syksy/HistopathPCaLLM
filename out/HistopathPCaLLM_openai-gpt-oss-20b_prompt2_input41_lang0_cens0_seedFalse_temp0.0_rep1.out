analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe. Sample 3 (left apex) shows little chronic inflammation. Left side also shows in samples 1 and 2 atrophied glands with remaining chronic inflammation. No signs of prostate cancer in the material."

We need to provide structured data with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

The sample type: the specimen is "representative systematic biopsies". That is a biopsy. So Sampletype: "biopsy".

Malignancy: "No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: Since no malignant tumor, Gleason should be "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to ensure correct formatting. The output should be JSON. No extra text.assistantfinal{
