analysisWe need to parse the statement:

"Samples 1-6 are representative systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe. Sample 3 (left apex) shows little chronic inflammation. Left side also shows in samples 1 and 2 atrophied glands with remaining chronic inflammation. No signs of prostate cancer in the material."

We need to produce JSON with fields:

- Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement refers to systematic biopsies. So Sampletype = "biopsy".

- Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". There are no signs of prostate cancer. So Malignancy = "no".

- Gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant statements or "NA" for benign. Since it's benign, Gleason = "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We should output exactly that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
