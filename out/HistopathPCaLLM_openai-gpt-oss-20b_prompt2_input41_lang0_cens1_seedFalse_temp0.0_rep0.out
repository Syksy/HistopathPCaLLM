analysisWe need to output JSON: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Determine sample type: statement: "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate" no mention biopsy, RP, TURP. It's a sample collection but type not specified. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Likely NA.

Malignancy: The statement says "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." There's no malignant tumor findings. So "NA" or "no"? The instructions: Provide "yes", "no" or "NA". If it's not determined if malignant, but no malignant findings. It says "Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not." Not clear. But does not state malignant. So likely "NA". But we might interpret "no malignant tumor findings" => "no". But the phrase indicates uncertainty. The instructions: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". There's no lesion. So maybe NA. But "Malignancy" "no" or "NA"? The example shows benign statements produce "NA" for all fields. So if benign, use NA. If not malignant, it's benign. However the statement is uncertain. But no malignant. I'd go with "NA". Gleason: "NA".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
