analysisWe need to produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "Samples are collected from left and right lobes of prostate. One sample showed little chronic inflammation, two samples showed atrophied glands and chronic inflammation. Hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not."

This is not a malignant finding; no mention of cancer, no Gleason. It's basically benign. So Sampletype? The sample type is not specified as biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says samples collected from left and right lobes of prostate. Could be biopsy, but not specified. Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since not specified, we use "NA". Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
