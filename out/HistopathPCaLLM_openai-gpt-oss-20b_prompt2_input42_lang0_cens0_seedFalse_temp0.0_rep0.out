analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g invastigated. Almost exclusively seen Gleason grade 4 differentiation, mostly in a small part of combined glands. Small amount of Gleason 3. Summary: score 7 (4+3)."

We should identify sample type: It's a prostatectomy specimen (RP). So "RP". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7" (or "4+3=7"). The example format uses "4+3=7". So we output JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"RP",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Check that we only use the most severe lesion: The severe is Gleason 4+3. So that's correct.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
