analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Prostatectomy preparate weighing approx 80g invastigated. Almost exclusively seen Gleason grade 4 differentiation, mostly in a small part of combined glands. Small amount of Gleason 3. Summary: score 7 (4+3)."

We need to provide JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype: likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7". They want "major+minor=sum" format: 4+3=7. So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is okay. Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7". Good.

Return just that JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
