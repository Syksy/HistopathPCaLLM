analysisWe must extract from the statement. The statement: "Prostate sample weighing app 8? is prepared. Mixed findings can be observed in small parts. However, whether it is cancer or inflammation cannot be determined."

We need sample type: allowed values biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. The statement does not specify any sample type. It only says "Prostate sample". So likely NA.

Malignancy: yes/no/NA. The statement indicates uncertain whether it's cancer or inflammation. So malignant cannot be determined. So NA.

Gleason: for malignant statements, major+minor=sum. For benign, NA. Since malignancy not determined, choose NA.

Thus output JSON:

{
"Sampletype":"NA",
"Malignancy":"NA",
"Gleason":"NA"
}

Return only that.assistantfinal```json

  "Sampletype": "NA",

  "Gleason": "NA"
