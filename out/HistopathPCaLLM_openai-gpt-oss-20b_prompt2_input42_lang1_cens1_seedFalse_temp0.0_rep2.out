analysisWe need to respond with JSON. Determine sample type: The statement says "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte, jonka paino noin 8?" That seems to be a specimen, maybe a radical prostatectomy? It says "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte" - sample type? It doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte" likely refers to prostate tissue sample for histopathology, maybe from a radical prostatectomy (RP). But the statement doesn't say that it's from a biopsy. It's a specimen, likely from a surgery. Could be "RP" (radical prostatectomy). However, sample type may be "NA" if ambiguous. The instructions: sampletype allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". We must pick one of these. The statement: "Valmistellaan prostatanäyte" suggests a sample prepared for analysis. No mention of biopsy or surgery. I'd pick "NA" because uncertain. But we could reason that "prostatanäyte" means prostate sample. Usually it's from a prostatectomy. But the phrase "paino noin 8?" maybe grams? Usually radical prostatectomy specimen weight around 25g. 8g is smaller. Could be a biopsy. But "paino" suggests larger sample weight, more like a prostatectomy. But "sekälaisia löydöksiä löydetään pieniltä alueilta" means "several findings found in small areas". "Ei kuitenkaan voida määrittää onko syöpää vai inflammaatiota" means "Cannot determine if cancer or inflammation." So we cannot determine malignancy. So Malignancy: "NA" or "ei"? The instruction: "Oliko näytteessä pahanlaatuisia löydöksiä (sallitut arvot 'kyllä', 'ei' tai 'NA')". Since cannot determine, possibly "NA". Gleason: "NA" because not malignant. So JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "NA",
"Malignancy": "NA",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

Alternatively, sampletype could be "RP". But risk of wrong. I'd choose NA.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
