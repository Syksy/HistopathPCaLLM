analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about prostate chippings as samples. It says "Only ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material." So sample type: It seems like a "RP"? The statement says "Approx 30g prostate chippings as samples. Material run in cassettes A-H, about 15g left in the jar." This likely refers to a radical prostatectomy specimen? The phrase "prostate chippings" might mean a prostate sampling, but context: it is a surgical specimen, "chippings" from the specimen. Usually, RP refers to radical prostatectomy. So sample type likely "RP". Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON:

{
"Sampletype": "RP",
"Malignancy": "no",
"Gleason": "NA"
}

We should double-check allowed values: Sampletype: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is fine. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no". Gleason: major+minor=sum or "NA" for benign. So "NA".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
