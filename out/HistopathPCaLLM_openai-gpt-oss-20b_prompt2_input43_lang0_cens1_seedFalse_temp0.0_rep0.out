analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says approximate 30g prostate samples, material placed in cassettes and jar. Mostly ordinary prostate tissue seen. Isolated atrophied glands visible, but no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached.

So it's a prostate specimen, likely from radical prostatectomy? The statement refers to "prostate samples" but not explicitly saying biopsy or RP. It says "approx 30g prostate samples" which is typical of a radical prostatectomy specimen. But the sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". We need to decide. It says "prostate samples" not "biopsy" or "TURP". The sample likely from a radical prostatectomy. So "RP".

Malignancy: "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached" => cannot determine malignant tumor findings. So "NA"? Or "no"? The spec says "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA")". If cannot determine malignant tumor findings, maybe "NA"? The statement says no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached, meaning we cannot say yes or no. So "NA".

Gleason: since cannot determine malignancy, we should set to "NA".

Return JSON with Sampletype: "RP", Malignancy: "NA", Gleason: "NA".

Let's double-check: There is no mention of cancer. So Malignancy: "no"? The statement says "no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached." That indicates that the pathologist cannot determine presence or absence. So "NA" seems appropriate.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}
