analysisWe need to parse the statement and produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We should use only the most severe lesion. The statement: "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine. Normally structured prostate tissue with varying gland sizes seen under microscope. Little chronic inflammation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious. Summary: Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen."

Interpretation: The sample is biopsy. Malignancy: "no tumor tissue can be seen" i.e., no current malignant tumor. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA" because no malignant. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check constraints: allowed values for Sampletype: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA".

Thus output that.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
