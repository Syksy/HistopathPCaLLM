analysisWe need to parse the statement. It is a pathology report: "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine. Normally structured prostate tissue with varying gland sizes seen under microscope. Little chronic inflamation and in some places atrophy. Nothing suspicious. Summary: Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen."

We must answer: Sampletype: biopsy? It says "Representative prostate biopsies", so sample type is "biopsy".

Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The summary says earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen. That implies currently no tumor tissue, so no malignant findings. So Malignancy: "no".

Gleason: Since no malignant findings, Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON. Ensure no nested structures. Output:

{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check that allowed values: Sampletype allowed "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA". Malignancy allowed "yes", "no", "NA". Gleason allowed "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Good.

Thus output.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
