analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about prostate biopsies. It says "Representative prostate biopsies according to standard routine." So sample type = biopsy. Then "Normal tissue, nothing suspicious." "Earlier biopsies showed prostate cancer, but now no tumor tissue can be seen." So current biopsy shows no malignant tumor. So Malignancy = no. Gleason = NA (since no malignant). The instruction: only most severe lesion, but if no malignant, we set to NA. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype must be one of "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Good. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". Good. Gleason: "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Good.

Return valid JSON.assistantfinal```json

  "Sampletype": "biopsy",

  "Gleason": "NA"
}
