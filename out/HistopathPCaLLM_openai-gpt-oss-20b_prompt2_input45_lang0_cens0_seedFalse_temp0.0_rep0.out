analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a prostatectomy specimen. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Are there malignant tumor findings? Yes, the statement describes a tumor focus, perineural invasion, etc. Gleason grade: "tissue gleason 3". It says "classes 3+4" earlier. Let's parse: "In focus, most of gland structures separated, but some build converging gland canals (classes 3+4). Seminal vesicles in sections O and P are clean. Perineural invasion seen, tissue gleason 3. Negative marginals, capsell intact." So there is a tumor focus with Gleason score 3? Or "classes 3+4" might refer to Gleason patterns? Usually Gleason grading uses patterns 1-5, major/minor. "classes 3+4" could mean major pattern 3, minor pattern 4, sum 7. But later they say "tissue gleason 3". That might indicate Gleason 3? But typical Gleason scores are 2-10. Gleason 3 is low grade, but usually pattern 3 is the major pattern, but sum might be 3? No, usually Gleason 3 is pattern 3 only - but sum is 3? That seems not typical. But the statement might be ambiguous. The instruction: "What is the reported Gleason grade (allowed values preferably'major+minor=sum' in the form of whole numbers for malignant statements or 'NA' for benign statements)." So we need to provide the reported Gleason grade. The most severe lesion: the tumor focus. The mention "classes 3+4" suggests maybe major pattern 3, minor pattern 4. So Gleason 3+4=7. That might be the best. There's also "tissue gleason 3" which seems contradictory. But we need the most severe lesion. The 3+4 suggests more severe than 3. So we should pick 3+4=7. So we output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check if any other malignant statements? Only one. So final.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
