analysisWe need to parse statement. Sample type: "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample" indicates radical prostatectomy, abbreviation RP. So Sampletype "RP".

Malignancy: yes, because tumor focus present. Gleason grade: The statement: "some build converging gland canals (classes 3+4).... tissue gleason 3." There's confusion. It says "classes 3+4" for gland canals, but then "tissue gleason 3." Typically Gleason score is sum of primary and secondary. They mention classes 3+4, so major+minor = 3+4=7. But then "tissue gleason 3." Might refer to Gleason pattern 3? The major+minor sum should be 7. Use 3+4=7. Provide "3+4=7" as Gleason. Should be whole numbers. So Malignancy "yes". Provide JSON.

Check if any nuance: It says "Perineural invasion seen, tissue gleason 3." That might be ambiguous. But classes 3+4 for gland canals likely implies Gleason 3+4=7. So output accordingly.

Return JSON: { "Sampletype":"RP", "Malignancy":"yes", "Gleason":"3+4=7" }.assistantfinal{
