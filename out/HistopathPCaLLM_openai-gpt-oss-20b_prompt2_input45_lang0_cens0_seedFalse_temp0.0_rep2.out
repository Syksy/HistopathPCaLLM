analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "A whole prostatectomy preparate as sample" indicates radical prostatectomy, so sample type "RP". Malignancy? There is a tumor focus: "fusing tumor tissue focus". So malignant yes. Gleason grade: It says "classes 3+4" then "tissue gleason 3" - ambiguous. But seems the Gleason pattern is 3+4? "classes 3+4" presumably patterns 3 and 4. "tissue gleason 3" perhaps indicates Gleason score 3? Actually Gleason grade is usually sum of primary and secondary patterns. "classes 3+4" suggests primary 3, secondary 4 => sum 7. But then "tissue gleason 3" maybe indicates Gleason 3? Possibly a mis-speak. The more severe lesion is the tumor focus. So we should report Gleason: "3+4=7". Use major+minor=sum. So "3+4=7". Provide JSON.

Check allowed values: sample type "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy "yes". Gleason "3+4=7".

Return JSON.assistantfinal{
