analysisWe need to examine the statement. It's about a suspect prostate sample. No mention of malignant tumor findings, no Gleason. It's basically uncertain: "However, the structure is unclear and not able to detect. Further inspection is needed." So we can't say malignant. According to instructions: only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. Provide answers to Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sample type: The statement says "A suspect prostate sample, processed according to the routine." Not specified as biopsy, RP, TURP. It's a sample, but we may consider "NA" because not specified. Malignancy: no. So "no". Gleason: NA.

But check if "suspect prostate sample" might be "biopsy"? It says "sample", not "biopsy". Usually "biopsy" means a tissue sample taken. But the statement does not specify biopsy. So "NA". So output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We should ensure JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
