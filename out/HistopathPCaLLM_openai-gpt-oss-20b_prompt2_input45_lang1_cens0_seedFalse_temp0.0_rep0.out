analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a pathological report. The sample type: "Näytteenä kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti" meaning a radical prostatectomy specimen. So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes, there is a cancer focus. Gleason: They report "luokat 3+4" meaning Gleason 3 and 4. They also mention "kudoksen gleason 3" but that's weird: "Perineuraalista invaasiota, kudoksen gleason 3." That might refer to the Gleason grade of the tumor component. They also mention "luokat 3+4" earlier. So overall Gleason 3+4 = 7. So Malignancy: "kyllä". Gleason: "3+4=7". Provide JSON with Sampletype: "RP", Malignancy: "kyllä", Gleason: "3+4=7". No nested. Ensure format.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
```
