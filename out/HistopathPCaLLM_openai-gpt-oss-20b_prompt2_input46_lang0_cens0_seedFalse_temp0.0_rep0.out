analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing shaved prostate chippings, sample type? The allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Shaved prostate chippings sounds like a surgical specimen (shaved from prostate). Could be a "RP" (radical prostatectomy) or "TURP"? But likely it's a surgical specimen from a prostate shaving procedure. The statement: "Shaved prostate chippings with total tissue weight around 20 gr. Material was set on eight cassettes, smaller portion of material was run. Regular prostate tissue with glands seen under microscope. Some gland findings coincide with basal cell hyperplasia. No signs of prostate cancer in the material." So sample type: "RP"? But "shaved chippings" might be from radical prostatectomy, but more like a "shave" of the prostate. The allowed values: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. I'd likely choose "RP" because it's a surgical specimen. But the statement doesn't explicitly say "RP" or "TURP". It says shaved prostate chippings. Could be a "shave" from a TURP? Usually "shave" can refer to "shave biopsies" used in TURP? But in pathology, "shave" refers to "shave biopsies" of the prostate. The sample type might be "biopsy" since it's small tissue fragments. But "shaved chippings" indicates a surgical specimen. I'd lean "RP" because it's a surgical removal. But I'm not entirely sure. The sample type is likely "RP" because it's a specimen from a radical prostatectomy. But no mention of prostatectomy. The sample type "shave" is often used for "shave biopsies" as part of TURP. But the sample type allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". "Shaved prostate chippings" could be from a TURP procedure. But if it's a shave, it's a small tissue fragment removed as part of surgery. It might be "TURP" because it's from a transurethral resection of prostate, where you shave tissue. But the statement does not mention TURP. It just says shaved prostate chippings. So maybe it's a "biopsy" because the tissue was set on cassettes, some portion run. It's basically a biopsy. But "shave" often indicates a surgical specimen from TURP. But the allowed sample types: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". I'd choose "TURP"? But the statement doesn't mention TURP. There's no mention of transurethral resection. But the sample type "shaved prostate chippings" is typical for a "shave biopsy" as part of a TURP. However, if it's from a radical prostatectomy, they'd usually say "prostatectomy specimen" or "prostatectomy". This says "Shaved prostate chippings". So likely it's a biopsy. I'd go with "biopsy". It's a small sample of tissue. So sample type "biopsy". Malignancy: "No signs of prostate cancer". So "no". Gleason: "NA". So JSON:
