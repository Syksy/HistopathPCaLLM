analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left. Total length of biopsies is roughly 3+4=7 cm. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a little lymfocytic accumulation that would indicate slight chronic inflammation. No malign findings on the left or the right."

We need to answer:

1. Sample type: The statement describes biopsies from right and left. So sample type is "biopsy". (Allowed: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA") So "biopsy".

2. Malignancy: No malign findings. So "no".

3. Gleason: For benign statements or no malignant, should be "NA". So "NA".

Return JSON. Ensure no nested structure. Provide exactly fields.

Thus:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check: allowed values for Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no".

Yes.assistantfinal{
