analysisWe need to parse the statement. It says "Examined three biopsies from the right and three from the left. Total length of biopsies is roughly 3+4=7 cm. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a little lymfocytic accumulation that would indicate slight chronic inflammation. No malign findings on the left or the right."

Thus sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA.

Return JSON object. Ensure keys exactly: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Values string. Output as JSON.

Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
