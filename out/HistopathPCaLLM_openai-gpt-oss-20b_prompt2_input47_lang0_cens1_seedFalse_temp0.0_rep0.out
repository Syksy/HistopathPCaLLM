analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a bit of lymphocytic accumulation that would indicate chronic inflammation. Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right."

We have to extract sample type: biopsy, RP (radical prostatectomy), TURP, or NA. This statement describes "Examined sample material from the right and the left." Could be from a prostatectomy? It's not explicitly "biopsy" or "RP" or "TURP". It says "Examined sample material from the right and left." Without context, likely radical prostatectomy (RP) because it's a specimen from both sides of prostate. But could be a biopsy. The phrase "sample material" is ambiguous. Usually "biopsy" would mention "biopsy cores." "Radical prostatectomy" would mention "whole organ" or "specimen" from prostate. "TURP" would mention "transurethral resection" and "en bloc" etc. We can't be certain.

But the instruction: Provide results from the most severe lesion. The statement indicates no malignant findings; "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." So maybe we cannot say "yes" or "no". Should be "NA" for Malignancy. Because it's uncertain.

Also Gleason: Since no malignant findings, we set "NA".

Thus Sampletype: Could be "NA" if not given. But the statement says "Examined sample material from the right and the left." That is not enough to determine sample type. So "NA".

Hence final JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check guidelines: "If not valid histopathological statement" we set NA for all. This statement is not a valid histopathological statement because it doesn't provide malignant tumor findings. So yes, we should output NA for all.

Thus final answer.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
