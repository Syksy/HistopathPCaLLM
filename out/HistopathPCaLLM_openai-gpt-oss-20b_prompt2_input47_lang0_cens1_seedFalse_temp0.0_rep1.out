analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is a histopathological report: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a bit of lymphocytic accumulation that would indicate chronic inflammation. Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right."

We have to determine: Sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The report says "Examined sample material from the right and the left." That suggests maybe radical prostatectomy? Actually "Examined sample material" could be from RP. But not explicitly says RP. Could be a biopsy? The phrase "sample material" ambiguous. But typical pathology reports for radical prostatectomy would say "prostatectomy specimen" etc. "Examined sample material" could be from a surgical specimen. There's no mention of biopsy. So best to set Sampletype: NA.

Malignancy: The report says "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." So no malignancy conclusion. So Malignancy: NA (or no?). Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If not able to determine, maybe NA. The question: "Were there malignant tumor findings" If not determined, answer NA.

Gleason: Since no malignancy, Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
