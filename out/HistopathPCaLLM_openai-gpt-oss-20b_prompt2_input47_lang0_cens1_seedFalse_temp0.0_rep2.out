analysisWe have a statement: "Examined sample material from the right and the left. Total amount of prostatic material is approx 30+40=70. On the left, normal prostate epithelium but in places a bit of lymphocytic accumulation that would indicate chronic inflammation. Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right."

We need to determine:

1. Sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "Examined sample material from the right and the left." It's unclear if it's a biopsy, radical prostatectomy, TURP. It doesn't specify. So "NA".

2. Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". The statement: "Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right." So cannot determine. Thus "NA".

3. Gleason: Should be "major+minor=sum" or "NA". Since no malignant findings, "NA".

Thus JSON: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}.

We need to output only these three fields. Ensure JSON object.assistantfinal```json

  "Gleason": "NA"
