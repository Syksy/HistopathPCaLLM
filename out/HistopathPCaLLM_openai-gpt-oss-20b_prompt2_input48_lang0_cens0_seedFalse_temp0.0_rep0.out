analysisWe need to parse statement. Sample type: "Examining prostate resection" implies radical prostatectomy (RP). So Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: yes. Gleason: "4+3=7"? Wait the summary says Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection. They mention first focus Gleason 4+3, second focus Gleason 5 (>80%) with some 4. But overall sum is 9. So major+minor sum 4+5? Actually Gleason 9 can be 4+5 or 5+4. They say total 9. So we should use "4+5=9" or "5+4=9". Which is typical? They mention most common Gleason 4, next common 3. In second focus, 5 >80% representation, small portion of Gleason 4. So if 5 dominates, major is 5, minor is 4, sum 9. So "5+4=9". Provide that. Malignancy: yes. Sampletype: "RP".

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
