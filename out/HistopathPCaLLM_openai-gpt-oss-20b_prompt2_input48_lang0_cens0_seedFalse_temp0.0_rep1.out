analysisWe need to parse the given statement. Determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason grade. The statement: "Examining prostate resection weighing 100g." So it's a prostate resection, which likely refers to radical prostatectomy (RP). Sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct.

Malignancy: yes, adenocarcinoma found. So "yes".

Gleason: we need the reported Gleason grade, for the most severe lesion. They mention: "First discovered tumor focus' most common Gleason is 4, next common 3. In second focus, Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4. SUMMARY: Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." So the Gleason is 9, likely 5+4=9? But they just say Gleason 9 tumor found. So we can output "5+4=9" or "5+4=9"? Allowed format "major+minor=sum". So for malignant statements, we need whole numbers. So "5+4=9" is fine. The major is 5, minor 4, sum 9. Alternatively could be "4+5=9" but the standard ordering is major first. Usually major is the predominant Gleason pattern, i.e., 5. So "5+4=9". The statement also says "Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4". So yes major 5 minor 4. So we output "5+4=9".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Make sure to output valid JSON.assistantfinal```json
