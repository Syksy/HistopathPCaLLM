analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's a prostate resection (RP). Malignancy yes. Gleason reported: "SUMMARY: Gleason 9 tumor found in the resection." So Gleason 9 is sum. The format should be "4+5=9" or "5+4=9" but they say "major+minor=sum". But the summary says Gleason 9. The typical major+minor representation is e.g., 5+4=9. The earlier says first focus: major 4, next common 3? Actually "First discovered tumor focus' most common Gleason is 4, next common 3." That seems like 4+3=7 but then second focus: Gleason 5 (>80%) representation, with small portion of Gleason 4. So overall the highest Gleason pattern is 5, second most common 4, so major is 5 minor is 4 sum 9. So we should output "5+4=9" as the Gleason. Use "RP" for sample type. Malignancy "yes". So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Check formatting. Also check that if no malignant, then NA. But we have malignant. So output that. Ensure no nested structures. Done.assistantfinal```json
