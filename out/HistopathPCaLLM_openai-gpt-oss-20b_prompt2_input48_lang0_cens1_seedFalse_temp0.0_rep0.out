analysisWe need to parse the statement. The task: produce structured data with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Only the most severe lesion should be returned, but we only have one statement. Determine sample type: The statement indicates "prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies." So sample type is "NA"? Allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Autopsy is not in the list. So should be "NA". Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement says "Some interesting findings, but due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." It doesn't mention malignant tumor, just interesting findings, no mention of carcinoma. So likely "NA" or "no"? Allowed values: "yes", "no" or "NA". If we cannot determine presence, we use "NA". Gleason: Not provided, "not used to derive differentiation scores". So "NA".

Thus JSON: { "Sampletype":"NA", "Malignancy":"NA", "Gleason":"NA" }assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
