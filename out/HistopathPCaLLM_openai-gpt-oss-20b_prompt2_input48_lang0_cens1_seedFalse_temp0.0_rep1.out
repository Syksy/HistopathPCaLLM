analysisWe need to parse the given statement. The statement: "Investigating in URO-101 course prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies with total size approx 100(?). Samples prepared according to standard routine, with apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles placed separately on cassettes. Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe. Seminal vesicles are all clean. Unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals, but interesting patterns are shown for educational purposes. SUMMARY: Some interesting findings, but due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)."

We need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

Allowed sample type: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA.

Here sample is from multiple autopsies. So not a biopsy, not RP, not TURP. So Sampletype: NA.

Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement: "Some interesting findings, but due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)." It does not mention malignant tumor. So we can say no? Actually if no malignant tumor findings, we should put "no". But could also be "NA" if not applicable. But since it's a histopathological statement about autopsy sample, it might not be malignant. The statement says "not used to derive differentiation scores", implying no Gleason. So Malignancy: no. But the instructions say if benign statements, Gleason: NA. So yes we set Malignancy: no.

Gleason: NA.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Double-check allowed Malignancy values: "yes", "no" or "NA". So "no" is acceptable.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
