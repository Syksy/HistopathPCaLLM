analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement is about "Investigating in URO-101 course prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies with total size approx 100(?). Samples prepared... Some exemplifying histological changes are seen in two sections left dorsal lobe. Seminal vesicles are all clean. Unable to determine the pattern changes for individuals, but interesting patterns are shown for educational purposes. SUMMARY: Some interesting findings, but due to the nature of the demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5)."

This is not a valid histopathological statement. There's no mention of malignant tumor findings. It's a demonstration, not used for Gleason. So we should output NA for all fields.

The sample type: it's "autopsy" but not among allowed values ("biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA"). So NA.

Malignancy: no malignant tumor findings; but we need to check if we can say "no"? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." The statement says "some interesting findings, but due to nature of demonstration this is not used to derive differentiation scores." No mention of malignant tumor. So we can interpret "no malignant tumor findings" or could be "NA". The example for invalid statement outputs "NA" for Malignancy. But the example for invalid had no malignant tumor findings and also "NA" for all fields. So we should choose NA for all fields.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Return this.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
