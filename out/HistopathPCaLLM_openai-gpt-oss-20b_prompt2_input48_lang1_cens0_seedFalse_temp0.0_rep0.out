analysisWe need to extract sample type, malignancy, Gleason. The statement: "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti, paino 100g..." It's a prostate resection (radical prostatectomy). So Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: yes, as adenocarcinoma present. Gleason: report says "Gleason 9" (major+minor). For malignant, we must give "major+minor=sum" format. So "4+5=9"? But the description says: first focus Gleason 4 and then 3; second focus Gleason 5 (>80% representation) with small part Gleason 4. The overall Gleason is 9. So maybe major = 5, minor = 4, sum =9. So "5+4=9". But typical Gleason representation: major pattern 5, minor 4. So "5+4=9". We'll output that.

Check that no nested structure. So JSON with keys exactly "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason".

Let's produce.

assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
