analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "Tutkitaan prostataresekaatti" => it's a radical prostatectomy (RP). So sample type "RP".

Malignancy: yes, adenocarcinoma present. So "kyllä".

Gleason: reported as Gleason 9 (4+5). The statement says: first focus Gleason 4 and 3; second focus 5 (>80%) and some 4. Summary: Gleason 9. So we output "4+5=9" or "5+4=9"? They want "major+minor=sum" format. For Gleason 9, typical representation: 5+4=9. But the text says first focus 4 and 3, second focus 5>80% and some 4. The dominant grade is 5 >80% so main grade 5, minor grade 4. So "5+4=9". They used "4+5=9" earlier? The example had "4+3=7". So we need "5+4=9" as major+minor. Use "5+4=9".

Return JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}

Check constraints: only these fields, no nested. All good.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "5+4=9"
}
