analysisWe need to produce JSON with Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement is about multiple body specimens from prostate tissue in a course, but says they cannot determine differentiation changes or Gleason. So sample type: these are multiple specimens, but likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy) or "biopsy"? The text says "useasta ruumiinavauksesta saatua eturauhasmateriaalia" meaning from multiple autopsies. Could be "RP" if radical prostatectomy, but they mention "ruumiinavaukset" which is autopsies. So sample type maybe "RP"? But the allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since it's from autopsies, not a surgical specimen, but maybe considered RP? However, the context: "useasta ruumiinavauksesta" likely autopsy samples. But the allowed values don't include autopsy. The safest is "NA" because not biopsy or RP. The Malignancy: no malignancy reported, just "but not used to determine differentiation". So likely "ei" or "NA"? They didn't mention malignant lesions. They just said "interestings findings but not used to determine Gleason". So malignant presence unknown. Could be "NA". Gleason: "NA" because not determined. So output: Sampletype: "NA", Malignancy: "NA", Gleason: "NA".

Return JSON.
