analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses. Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma. Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4."

We need to determine sample type: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". This is describing "prostate chippings" maybe from a radical prostatectomy? "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings" suggests a radical prostatectomy (RP) specimen. So Sampletype likely "RP". There's no mention of biopsy or TURP. So "RP".

Malignancy: Yes, carcinoma present in 5 shavings. So "yes".

Gleason: We have two classes 3 and 4. But need major+minor=sum. The most common Gleason class is 3, second most common is 4. This likely indicates a Gleason pattern 3+4? But typical assignment: major pattern is the highest pattern observed; minor is the second highest. So if pattern 4 is higher. So major=4, minor=3. Sum=7. So "4+3=7".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

Check if any nuance: The statement says "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." That might be ambiguous: The most common is 3, second most common is 4. So the pattern 3 is more common across shavings; but the presence of pattern 4 is second. But typically Gleason grade is sum of the two highest patterns. So it would be 4+3=7. That seems right.

Return JSON only.assistantfinal{
