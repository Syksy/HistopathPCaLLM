analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about specimen: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses. Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma. Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4."

We need to determine sample type: what is the sample type? This seems like "chippings" from prostate, likely a "biopsy" or maybe "TURP"? It's ambiguous. Could be "biopsy" but also could be "RP" (radical prostatectomy). "Chippings" suggests sampling of prostate tissue, maybe from a prostatectomy or from a TURP. But the phrase "rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses" suggests intraoperative or postoperative sampling, maybe from a prostatectomy. They talk about "shavings" on glasses, likely slides from a prostatectomy specimen. So sample type likely "RP" (radical prostatectomy). But the instructions: allowed sample types are "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So we must decide. The statement says "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings", probably from a prostatectomy. So "RP". Malignancy: yes (carcinoma present). Gleason: they give most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4. They didn't give sum. Usually Gleason score is sum of primary + secondary. If most common Gleason class is 3 and second most common is 4, we might interpret as primary 3, secondary 4, sum 3+4=7. So Gleason: "3+4=7".

But we need only the most severe lesion: we have carcinoma present. The Gleason score is 3+4. That is the highest. So "Gleason": "3+4=7".

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check if any nuance: The statement says "Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma. Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." That implies carcinoma with Gleason 3+4. So correct.
