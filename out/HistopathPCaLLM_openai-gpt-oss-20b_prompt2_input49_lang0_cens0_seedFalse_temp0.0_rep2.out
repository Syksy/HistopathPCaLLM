analysisWe need to parse the given statement. Determine sample type: "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses. Of these, 5 shavings contained carcinoma. Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4."

This is describing a pathology report of chippings from the prostate, likely from a radical prostatectomy specimen? The term "chippings" likely from a prostatectomy or TURP? It says "rest of the prostate chippings, remaining 90 shavings on 8 glasses." This could be from a radical prostatectomy (RP). But sample type options: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". The text says "Investigated rest of the prostate chippings" - maybe indicates the entire prostate after initial sampling? It might be from a radical prostatectomy (RP). Because chippings from the prostate are typical of RP specimen processing. So sample type likely "RP". There's no mention of TURP or biopsy. So choose "RP".

Malignancy: Yes, since carcinoma present in 5 shavings. So "yes".

Gleason grade: They mention "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." So the two most common Gleason patterns are 3 and 4. They didn't give a sum. Usually Gleason score is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7? The most common pattern is 3, second most common is 4. That suggests the pattern distribution: 3 (major) and 4 (minor). The usual convention: major pattern first. So Gleason = "3+4=7". However, it might also be 4+3=7? But since they say most common is 3, second is 4, so major is 3. So sum 3+4=7.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check if any nuance: They mention 5 shavings contain carcinoma. The statement: "Most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4." That is the maximum Gleason pattern? Usually Gleason grade is major+minor= sum. So 3+4=7. So yes. Provide JSON.assistantfinal```json
