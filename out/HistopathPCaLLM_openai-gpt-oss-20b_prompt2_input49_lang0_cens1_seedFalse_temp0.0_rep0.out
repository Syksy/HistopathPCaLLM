analysisWe need to process the statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possibile due to the technical limitations."

We need to determine:

1. Sampletype: allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", "NA".

The statement says "investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses." Not explicitly specifying biopsy or RP or TURP. "glasses" maybe refers to slides. "Rest of the prostate samples" could be from a radical prostatectomy? Usually prostate samples from RP are multiple cores, but it's not clear. "rest of the prostate samples" might refer to the rest of the prostate after some other procedure? Could be from a biopsy? The phrase "prostate samples" is ambiguous. We need to decide if it's a valid histopathological statement.

Second: Malignancy: yes/no/NA. The statement says "some changes that warrant further investigation" but no mention of malignant tumor. So might be "NA" or "no"? The instruction: "malignant tumor findings" allowed values yes/no/NA. If uncertain or no malignant tumor, we might say "no" if it's explicitly benign. But here it's uncertain, no mention of malignant. It's "some changes that warrant further investigation". That might be suspicious but not necessarily malignant. Since it's not a clear malignant statement, we can set "NA" maybe. But guidelines: They want you to only provide data from the most severe lesion. "Malignancy" should be "yes" if there is malignant tumor findings. If not present we can say "no" or "NA". The example: For non-histopathological statements, they set all to NA. But if there's ambiguous statement, we might set NA.

Third: Gleason: Should be "major+minor=sum" or NA for benign or if not applicable. Since no Gleason, set NA.

Thus likely all NA.

But we must consider sample type. "Prostate samples" might be from a radical prostatectomy (RP). In pathology, the prostate is removed during RP. But "glasses" indicates slides, not necessarily a sample type. "Rest of the prostate samples" could be from an RP. I'd lean to sample type "RP" maybe? But it's not explicitly stated. The statement says "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses." It doesn't say "biopsy" or "RP". Could be ambiguous. So "NA" seems safe. The example for non-histopathological statement had all NA. But here we have some mention of changes, but not malignant. It is ambiguous.

Thus final answer: {"Sampletype":"NA","Malignancy":"NA","Gleason":"NA"}.

We should produce JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
