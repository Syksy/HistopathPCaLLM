analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Investigated rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses. Of these, fifth glass contained some changes that warrant further investigation. At this time, assessing the findings further is not possibile due to the technical limitations."

We need to decide if it's a valid histopathological statement. It's describing prostate samples, but not specifying sample type or malignancy or Gleason grade. It says some changes warrant further investigation but no malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade. There's no mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. So sample type unknown => NA. Malignancy: "some changes warrant further investigation" but not confirmed malignant. Could be considered no malignant tumor findings. The allowed values: yes, no, NA. I'd choose "no" if there's no malignant tumor findings. But are there malignant findings? The text doesn't mention malignant, just changes warranting further investigation. So "no". Gleason: NA. The instruction says only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, but we have no malignant lesions. So we output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But wait: sample type unknown. Could it be "biopsy"? The statement refers to "prostate samples on 8 glasses". That could be biopsy or other. But no clear type. So NA.

Thus final JSON.assistantfinal```json
