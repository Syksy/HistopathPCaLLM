analysisWe need to parse the given statement: "Tutkitaan loput eturauhasen höyläyslastuista, vielä 90 lastua 8:lla lasilla. Näistä 5:ssä lastussa löydettiin karsinooma. Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4."

We need to produce JSON with fields:

Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Here it's referring to "eturauhasen höyläyslastuista" meaning "prostate core needle biopsies" maybe. The phrase "lähyt" is "cores"? "höyläyslastuista" maybe core biopsies. So sample type likely "biopsy". Could also be "RP" (radical prostatectomy) but not mentioned. So "biopsy".

Malignancy: "kyllä" or "ei" or "NA". There are malignant findings: 5 cores have carcinoma. So malignancy present => "kyllä".

Gleason: "major+minor=sum" for malignant findings. They say "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." That indicates most frequent Gleason patterns? They didn't give sum. The typical Gleason 3 (pattern 3) maybe major? But typical Gleason pattern 3 is the major component? Usually Gleason pattern 3 is the most common, pattern 4 the second. They didn't give sum. But we need to give a Gleason string like "3+4=7"? But the sum is 7. But is that the reported Gleason? The text says "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." So maybe the Gleason pattern per case? Usually Gleason score comprises primary (most common) and secondary (second most common). So if primary is 3, secondary is 4, then Gleason 3+4=7. So we can output "3+4=7". That is a valid Gleason. They didn't mention sum but we can compute. This is a typical approach.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}

Check if any nuance: The text says "Tavallisin Gleason luokka on 3, seuraavaksi yleisin Gleason luokka 4." They didn't mention "sum" but we can assume typical Gleason pattern. The sample type is "biopsy". So output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "3+4=7"
}
