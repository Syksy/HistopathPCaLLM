analysisWe need to parse the given statement: "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla. Näistä viidennessä lasissa nähtiin joitakin muutoksia, jotka kaipaavat jatkotutkimuksia. Juuri nyt löydösten arviointi ei ole mahdollista teknisten rajoitusten takia."

We need to produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

We must consider only the worst lesion results; but we only have a statement about "some changes needing further investigation" but not specifying malignancy or Gleason. So we can't determine malignancy. The sample type? It mentions "prostataanäytteistä" plural. It says "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." So they looked at the rest of prostate samples with 8 slides. This seems like a radical prostatectomy? Actually might be a specimen from a prostatectomy. It says "loput" means rest; likely from a prostatectomy (RP). The sample type could be RP. But we need to check if the sample type is "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement doesn't say "biopsy" or "radical prostatectomy" or "TURP". It just says "loput prostatanäytteistä" meaning the rest of the prostate samples. Might be from a radical prostatectomy specimen.

We might need to interpret sample type: "loput" could refer to the rest of the prostate after a previous biopsy. In a radical prostatectomy, you look at the whole prostate. They might reference "8:lla lasilla" meaning 8 slides. So I'd guess sample type is "RP". But not 100% certain. However, we have to provide a value from allowed set. If uncertain, we might set NA. But we can try to interpret. The statement: "Tutkittiin loput prostatanäytteistä 8:lla lasilla." The phrase "loput" indicates leftover tissue, presumably from a prostatectomy. It's not a biopsy because it's the rest of the organ. So RP seems plausible.

Now malignancy: It mentions some changes requiring further study; cannot assess now. So no definitive malignancy. We should set "Malignancy": "NA" because we cannot determine.

Gleason: Not reported; we can't provide a sum. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But sample type might be "NA" if we think it's not clear. But I'd go with RP. Let's output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
