analysisWe need to parse the statement and produce JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. The statement is about samples 1 to 6, prostate biopsies. The statement says: "Samples 1 to 6 consist of prostate biopsies taken from standard locations. Sample 3 biopsy cylinders are not representative, as no prostate tissue is observed there-in. Otherwise the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed. Granular epithelial cells do not present notable atypic patterns. The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes." So overall, no malignant tumor findings. So Malignancy: "no". Gleason: "NA". Sampletype: "biopsy" because it's biopsies. So JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to ensure no nested structure. That's fine.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "biopsy",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
