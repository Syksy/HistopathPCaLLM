analysisWe have a statement:

"Samples 1 to 6 consist of prostate biopsies taken from standard locations. Sample 3 biopsy cylinders are not representative, as no prostate tissue is observed there-in. Otherwise the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed. Grandular epithelial cells do not present notable atypic patterns. The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes."

We need to structure data: Sampletype: allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Here it's biopsies. So "biopsy".

Malignancy: "yes", "no" or "NA". The statement says no adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. So malignant tumor findings: no.

Gleason: for malignant statements, give "major+minor=sum". For benign statements, "NA". Since no malignancy, Gleason is "NA".

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We must ensure no nested structures. That is fine.

Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
