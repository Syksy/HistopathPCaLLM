analysisWe need to parse the statement. The statement: "Samples 1 to 6 consist of prostate biopsies taken from standard locations. Sample 3 biopsy cylinders are not representative, as no prostate tissue is observed there-in. Otherwise the samples are representative and benign prostate tissue is observed. Grandular epithelial cells do not present notable atypic patterns. The samples do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes."

Thus sample type: biopsy. Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA (since benign). The instruction: "For malignant statements, report Gleason as major+minor=sum". For benign, use "NA". So produce:

{
 "Sampletype": "biopsy",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We should ensure valid JSON. Yes.assistantfinal```json
