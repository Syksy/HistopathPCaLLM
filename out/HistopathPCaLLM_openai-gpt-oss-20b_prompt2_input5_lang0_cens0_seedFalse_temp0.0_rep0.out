analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a radical prostatectomy specimen. Sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes (cancerous tissue observed). Gleason grade: The statement: Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, dominant 4 approx 60%. Macro B higher sum (9) observed of architecture 4+5, proportions approx 50% and 20%. We need the most severe lesion: macro B with 4+5 sum 9. So Gleason: "4+5=9". Provide JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Use allowed values: Sampletype: "RP". Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+5=9". Done.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
