analysisWe need to produce structured JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. We must consider only the most severe lesion. The statement: "The specimen consists of a radical prostatectomy... Microscopically cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3, with the dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. In macro B higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5, with the proportions approx 50% and 20%. Other prostate macroblocks are clean along with the seminal vehicles. No penetration of the prostate capsule or perineural invasion is observed."

We need to parse: sample type is "RP" because radical prostatectomy. Malignancy: yes because cancerous tissue observed. Gleason: we need the reported Gleason grade of the most severe lesion. Macro B has growth pattern 4+5, sum 9. Macro A has 4+3 sum 7. Most severe is 4+5=9. So Gleason: "4+5=9".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Check allowed values: "Sampletype": "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Good. "Malignancy": "yes", "no", or "NA". Good. "Gleason": "major+minor=sum" whole numbers, or "NA" for benign. Good.

Thus final JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
