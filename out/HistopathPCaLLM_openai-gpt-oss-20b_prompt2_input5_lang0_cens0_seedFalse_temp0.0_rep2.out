analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's about a radical prostatectomy (RP). Malignant tumor findings? Yes: microscopically cancerous tissue observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B). Gleason grade: Macro A exhibits growth pattern 4+3. Macro B higher sum (9) observed of architecture 4+5. The dominant differentiation architecture 4 presenting approx 60%. But overall we need the most severe lesion: the highest Gleason. Macro B shows 4+5 = 9. That is higher than 4+3=7. So we should report Gleason "4+5=9" presumably. The sample type: "RP". Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+5=9". Ensure JSON. No nested structures. Provide only those fields.assistantfinal```json
