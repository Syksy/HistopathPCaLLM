analysisWe need to parse the given Finnish text. The task: produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Sampletype allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP", or "NA". Malignancy: "kyllä", "ei", "NA". Gleason: "major+minor=sum" as integers for malignant findings, or "NA" for benign.

We need to consider only the worst lesion results. The sample is a radical prostatectomy (radikaali prostatektomia). So sample type should be "RP". Malignancy: there are malignant findings: yes. So "kyllä". Gleason: we need to pick the worst (highest sum). Let's examine the Gleason reports: In macro A: "4+3" meaning 4+3=7. Macro B: "4+5" meaning 4+5=9. So the worst is 4+5=9. So output "4+5=9".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}

Check that it's not nested. Just top-level key-value pairs. That seems correct.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+5=9"
}
```
