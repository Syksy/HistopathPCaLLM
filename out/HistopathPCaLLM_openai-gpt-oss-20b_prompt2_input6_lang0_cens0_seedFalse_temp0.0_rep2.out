analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing a specimen: "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips, which are run via three tissue casettes. Microscopically relatively normal prostate grandular structures are observed, although a heavy burn artefact is present. Although glands are largely unobservable due to the artefacts, the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia."

We need to determine sample type: possible values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". The statement says "Samples consist of total 4g shaving chips". Shaving chips are typically from radical prostatectomy? "shaving chips" are from radical prostatectomy (RP). But it could also be from TURP? Shaving chips are usually from radical prostatectomy (RP). They refer to "shaving" as in "shave" of the prostate specimen. So likely RP.

Malignancy: Are there malignant tumor findings? The statement says "the findings hint at the specimen presenting with benign prostate hyperplasia." So no malignancy: "no".

Gleason: There is no Gleason because benign. So "NA".

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Check if any other nuance: The statement indicates benign. So correct. Return JSON.assistantfinal```json
