analysisWe need to parse the statement. Determine sample type: "Casettes contain routinely collected prostate biopsies" => sample type "biopsy". Malignancy: It says focus with small granular structures with stromal atypia with morphological changes suggesting adenocarcinoma is observed. However, conclusion remains on suspicion-level, and clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet. So the statement says suspicion of adenocarcinoma but not confirmed. So malignant tumor findings? The instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings" allowed values: yes, no, NA. If suspicious but not confirmed, I'd interpret as no malignant tumor findings (not confirmed). So "no". Gleason: No Gleason grade reported. So "NA". Return JSON. Ensure no nested. Provide 3 fields. Let's produce.assistantfinal```json
