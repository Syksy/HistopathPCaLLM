analysisWe need to parse the statement: "Sufficient amount of prostate sample material was routinely collected according to provided instructions. One sample exhibited a point of interest, with some atypical structures and morphological changes. The finding was so diminishingly small, that in the end no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material, as rest of the material exhibited structures one would typically expect. /John Doe, Meilahti, 11.11.2011"

We need to determine sample type: The statement doesn't specify biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says "prostate sample material was routinely collected". Could be biopsy. But sample type allowed values: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". Since not specified, maybe "NA". But maybe it's a biopsy? The phrase "sample exhibited a point of interest" suggests a biopsy. But not explicit. The instructions: "Only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." We need to decide if malignant tumor findings present. Statement: "One sample exhibited a point of interest, with some atypical structures and morphological changes. The finding was so diminishingly small, that in the end no definite conclusions could be drawn from the material." So no definite conclusions, no malignant tumor findings. Likely "no" for Malignancy. Gleason would be "NA". Sample type? If not specified, "NA". But maybe "biopsy" is default? The earlier example: "Adenocarcinoma is detected in the prostate biopsy" - sample type "biopsy". But here, no clear mention. The phrase "prostate sample material" could be a biopsy. But it's ambiguous. The safe choice: "NA" for sample type.

Thus JSON:
{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

We need to ensure JSON format.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "no",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
```
