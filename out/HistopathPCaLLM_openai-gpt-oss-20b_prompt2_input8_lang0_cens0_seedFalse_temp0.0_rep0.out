analysisWe need to parse the statement. Identify sample type: "Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate." So sample type is "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: yes (tumor tissue observed, invasive properties). Gleason: highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7. So output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

We should ensure we use correct allowed values: Sampletype: "RP" (capitalization maybe uppercase but allowed values exact: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct. Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7". Return as JSON.assistantfinal```json
