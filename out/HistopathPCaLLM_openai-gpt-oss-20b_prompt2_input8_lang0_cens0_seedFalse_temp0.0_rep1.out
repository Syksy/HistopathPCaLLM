analysisWe need to parse the statement. We need to produce JSON with three fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason. Must use only the most severe lesion. Let's analyze.

Statement: "Samples 1 and 2 contain lymph nodes (3 pcs each), with lengths spanning 1 to 3 cm. Sample 3 contains radical prostatectomy preparate, which is run according to the routine protocol. In the third sample tumor tissue is observed in both lobes, with invasive properties and forming fusing and separately growing grandular structures. The findings cover approx 10% of the section area. Additionally, aggregates of macrophages are observed and high grade inflammatory changes. Highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7, with the lower grade 3 consisting of approx 30%. High grade PIN-changes are also observed. The inspected lymph nodes are free from malignant findings (0/6)."

We have sample types: biopsy, RP, TURP, NA. The sample 3 is radical prostatectomy preparate. So sample type: "RP". The statement has malignant tumor findings: yes. We need to consider only the most severe lesion. There's malignant tumor in sample 3 (prostate). Also lymph nodes are free. So the malignant tumor is in RP sample. So Malignancy: "yes". Gleason: "4+3=7". The statement gives that as highest identified Gleason growth pattern. So we output:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "yes",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

We must ensure JSON formatting. No extra whitespace? It's okay. Ensure correct field names. Also note that we only need one set of fields. We don't need to include lymph node info. So final output.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
