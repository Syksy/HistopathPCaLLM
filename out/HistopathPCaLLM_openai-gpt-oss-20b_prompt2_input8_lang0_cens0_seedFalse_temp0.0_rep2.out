analysisWe need to parse the statement, determine sample type, malignancy, Gleason. The statement describes samples 1 and 2 lymph nodes; sample 3 radical prostatectomy preparate. The malignant tumor findings: tumor tissue in both lobes observed, invasive properties. So yes malignant. Gleason: highest identified Gleason growth pattern is 4+3=7. So Gleason "4+3=7". Sample type: "RP" because radical prostatectomy. The most severe lesion: the malignant tumor in sample 3. So output:

{
"Sampletype":"RP",
"Malignancy":"yes",
"Gleason":"4+3=7"
}

Check allowed values: Sampletype allowed values "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". So "RP" is correct. Malignancy "yes". Gleason "4+3=7". JSON with keys exactly as specified: "Sampletype", "Malignancy", "Gleason". Ensure no nested structures. Output only that JSON.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "yes",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
