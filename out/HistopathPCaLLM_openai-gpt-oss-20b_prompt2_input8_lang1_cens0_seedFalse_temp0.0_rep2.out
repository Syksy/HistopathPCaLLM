analysisWe need to parse the passage. We have 3 samples: sample 1 and 2 are lymph nodes, sample 3 is radical prostatectomy specimen. We need to output one JSON with fields: Sampletype, Malignancy, Gleason.

But the instruction says: "vain pahimman leesion tulokset tulisi palauttaa eikä rakenteinen tulos saisi koostua sisäkkäisistä rakenteista." Means: only the worst lesion results should be returned and the structured result should not consist of nested structures. So we need to produce a single JSON object summarizing the worst lesion among all samples. The worst lesion would be the prostatectomy specimen (sample 3) with malignant findings. So sample type: "RP" (radical prostatectomy). Malignancy: "kyllä". Gleason: "4+3=7". That seems correct.

We need to confirm sample type mapping: "biopsy", "RP", "TURP" or "NA". "RP" is radical prostatectomy. Good.

Thus output JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "RP",
 "Malignancy": "kyllä",
 "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}

No nested structure. Should we include quotes? yes. Ensure it's valid JSON.

Thus final answer.assistantfinal```json
{
  "Sampletype": "RP",
  "Malignancy": "kyllä",
  "Gleason": "4+3=7"
}
```
