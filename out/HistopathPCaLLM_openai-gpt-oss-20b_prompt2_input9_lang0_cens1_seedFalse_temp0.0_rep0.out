analysisWe need to parse the statement. It's describing a sample. It says "Large quantities of prostate tissue was observed, and the epithelial cell lining appears rather normal. Parts of the grandular structures appear to be disproportionate, which could be attributed to technical difficulties in processing of the sample. Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn..."

This is not a malignant statement. No Gleason. It says uncertain. So sample type? It doesn't say biopsy, RP, TURP. It just says "sample material was obtained" but not specifying. So Sampletype: NA. Malignancy: NA? The instruction says: "Were there malignant tumor findings (allowed values: 'yes', 'no' or 'NA')." Since it's unclear, we should set NA? The example for invalid statement had "NA" for all. But here it's not invalid: It's ambiguous but not malignant. Does "no" apply? The guidelines: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned". This statement says no malignant tumor findings, conclusions cannot be drawn, but basically no evidence of malignant. So Malignancy: no. Gleason: NA. Sampletype: NA because not specified.

Thus JSON:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "no",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

But check: It says sample material obtained, but no mention of biopsy, RP, TURP. So NA. Malignancy: no? The statement doesn't say malignant tumor. So probably "no". But instructions: "Were there malignant tumor findings" - we could say "no" because no malignant tumor was found. But also "Conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn" indicates maybe uncertain, but no malignant. I'd go "no".

Thus final output.assistantfinal```json
