analysisWe need to interpret the statement. It's describing sample material, some prostate tissue, but mentions that histology shows large quantity of prostate tissue, epithelial lining appears normal, some issues with processing, and can't draw conclusions. There's no mention of malignant tumor findings or Gleason grade. So it's not a valid histopathological statement. So we should output JSON with "Sampletype": "NA", "Malignancy": "NA", "Gleason": "NA".

We should check if any sample type can be inferred: It's not biopsy, RP, TURP. It's some sample material from a lab, maybe a core. But the instruction: "only the results from the most severe lesion should be returned, and the structured result should not consist of nested structures." It's not a valid statement. So all NA.

Thus output:

{
 "Sampletype": "NA",
 "Malignancy": "NA",
 "Gleason": "NA"
}

Make sure JSON.assistantfinal{
  "Sampletype": "NA",
  "Malignancy": "NA",
  "Gleason": "NA"
}
