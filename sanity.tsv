0	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Chipping samples totaled approx 30 g” clearly indicates that the material is TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “benign prostate tissue was observed, with no atypia, malignancies, or carcinoma,” so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is reported or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman; only “chipping samples” is slightly non-standard (the usual term is “chips” or “resection chips”), but the meaning remains clear.
1	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate tissue” and “sample material,” but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue,” not the specific procedure.	: No  	: The text explicitly says that “any inference of cell atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma cannot be conducted.” It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; it declares the findings inconclusive. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor denied, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but the phrase “A lot sample material” should be “A lot of sample material” or “A large amount of sample material.” Additionally, “which were run in multiple batches” would be clearer as “which was processed in multiple batches” (material is singular).
2	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “12 representative needle biopsies” clearly indicates that the sample type is needle-core biopsies taken from standard locations.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly concludes that “only benign-like growth is observed,” which directly conveys the absence of malignancy.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable to a layman, although “grandular” should read “glandular.”
3	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate cancer samples from standard locations,” which implies biopsies, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The statement says “mostly normal cell architectures are observed,” and no malignant findings are described. Because the interpretation is “still underway,” we cannot conclude whether malignancy is present or absent; the information is inconclusive.	: Not applicable  	: No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any Gleason grading is provided, so Gleason scores cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but “grandular” should be “glandular,” and “wave-like epithelial structures” is an unusual phrasing. These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
4	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “a fresh prostatectomy specimen,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that all examined sections show “normal benign growth,” “no abnormal growth,” and “no tumor growth.” Therefore, the findings are confirmed benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy is present, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is generally understandable and uses appropriate terminology for a pathology report. Minor wording issues such as “vehicles” instead of “seminal vesicles” and “resection are surfaces” instead of “resection margins” are present, but they do not impede comprehension.
5	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “autopsy specimen” and “fresh sample,” which implies the material is post-mortem tissue, but it does not explicitly state the organ (prostate) or the usual clinical specimen types (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The text explicitly says that “further findings cannot be reliably inferred” and that the samples can be “only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma.” Thus, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be determined from the information provided.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information is given or can be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a layperson. Minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “macro/microsections,” “marker colours”) is acceptable within a pathology context and does not impede comprehension.
6	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate chippings,” which is a clear indication that the specimen is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “Nothing indicating malignancy is found” unequivocally states that no malignant changes were detected; therefore, the malignancy status can be assessed as benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and thus cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are small grammatical issues: “is started on one casette” should read “is submitted in one cassette,” and “spotted chronic inflammation is apparently” should be “focal chronic inflammation is apparent.” These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
7	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate material” and “a single run,” which strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.). Therefore the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “nothing conclusive may be derived” and does not report any malignant or benign findings. Because the examination is inconclusive, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear and understandable, although “run” is an informal term for a histopathology report. No major grammatical errors impede comprehension.
8	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies taken from standard locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The text states that “the samples … do not therefore appear to contain adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes,” confirming that no malignant findings are present.	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence the Gleason score is not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but contains a spelling error (“Grandular” should be “Glandular”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“there-in”). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
9	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “several sampling sites from standard locations,” which implies a multi-site biopsy, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The text explicitly says the material is “insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes.” Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out, the malignancy status remains unassessable.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason scores are provided or inferable. The statement does not mention any cancer diagnosis, so Gleason grading is not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and vocabulary are clear and professional. While a layman might need to look up “adenocarcinoma” or “PIN-like changes,” the overall phrasing is understandable and free of major errors.
10	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “radical prostatectomy” and gives further macroscopic details (weight, colour coding of sections, block designations), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text reports “cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)” and describes architectural patterns consistent with prostate adenocarcinoma. Other blocks are stated to be “clean,” confirming that malignancy is present in the specified areas.	: Yes  	: Two separate tumour areas are described:  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (“macroes” instead of “macroscopic sections,” “seminal vehicles” instead of “seminal vesicles”) are common in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
11	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples taken from both apex and basis” and “samplings from the left … right”, which strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The statement repeatedly says that “clear prostate tissue” is seen and that Gleason classes “could not be inferred.” No malignant diagnosis is given; instead, the findings are inconclusive. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that “Major and minor Gleason classes … could not be inferred” and that a “suspected higher sum” is referred to a colleague. No actual Gleason pattern or score is provided, so the Gleason information is not assessable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The language is generally understandable, but contains awkward or non-standard phrasing such as “relatively enlargened prostate” (should be “enlarged”), “inspected longitudinally + crossed” (unclear), and “main macros” (ambiguous). These minor issues do not render the text incomprehensible, but a lay reader might need clarification.
12	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “shaving chips” and “three tissue cassettes,” which clearly identifies the material as TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “relatively normal prostate glandular structures” are seen and concludes that the findings “hint at … benign prostate hyperplasia.” This is an explicit declaration that no malignancy is present.  	: Not applicable  	: Because the findings are reported as benign (benign prostatic hyperplasia), no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically understandable and uses terminology that a layman could grasp, despite minor stylistic choices such as “grandular” instead of “glandular.”
13	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “original prostatic operation material,” which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The report explicitly states that the findings are inconclusive because the tissue is heavily affected by burn artefact. No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; the material is simply described as “relatively normal prostate tissue structures,” but this is not a verified benign finding. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not mentioned and cannot be inferred. The statement is inconclusive, so Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and vocabulary are clear and professional. While the phrase “run in three separate batches” is slightly informal, it remains understandable. Overall, the statement is appropriate for both specialists and informed lay readers.
14	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that the material consists of “routinely collected prostate biopsies,” so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Partially  	: A suspicious focus “suggesting adenocarcinoma” is mentioned, but the pathologist explicitly refrains from giving a conclusive malignant diagnosis. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully assessed—only suspected.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the description.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor spelling/grammatical issues: “grandular” should be “glandular,” “basis” should probably be “base,” and “clear conclusive finding cannot be drawn yet” is slightly awkward.
15	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate sample material” and “routinely collected,” which implies a biopsy or similar specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “no definite conclusions could be drawn” and that the rest of the material was typical. This means malignancy was neither confirmed nor ruled out; the findings are inconclusive rather than benign. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis was rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable. The score is therefore not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layperson. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “diminishingly small”) are acceptable in a pathology context.
16	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly identifies sample 3 as “radical prostatectomy preparate” and samples 1–2 as lymph-node specimens, so the sample type is clearly stated.  	: Yes  	: The report states that “tumor tissue is observed in both lobes” with “invasive properties,” confirming malignancy. The lymph nodes are explicitly described as “free from malignant findings,” which is also a clear malignancy status.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given as “4+3=7,” satisfying the required format (major + minor = sum).  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (“preparate” instead of “specimen,” “grandular” instead of “glandular”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
17	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples with indices 1 and 2” and “sample 3”, but it never explicitly states what type of specimens these are (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.	: Partially  	: The text explicitly says that samples 1 and 2 are “completely free of malignant findings”, so malignancy status for those two is clear. For sample 3, however, the wording is ambiguous: “potentially interesting properties”, “varying growth patterns”, “highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing”, “no grade score is reported”, and “suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed”. These phrases indicate that malignancy status for sample 3 is inconclusive rather than confirmed benign or malignant.	: No  	: The statement explicitly states that the Gleason fields are empty (“empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor”) and that “no grade score is reported”. Hence no usable Gleason score (major + minor = sum) can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains several awkward or non-standard phrases (“covers approx 10%”, “empty fields ? and ?”, “PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus”). These do not render it incomprehensible, yet they could be improved for clarity.
18	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “electrosection shavings” and gives the weight of the material, which clearly identifies the specimen as TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states “No malignant findings are observed” and concludes that the findings “fit the expected benign hyperplasia,” so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and largely correct. Minor wording issues (“grandular” should be “glandular,” “fits” should be “fit”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
19	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	0	1	: No  	: The text never specifies whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or any other source. It only mentions “a few dozen grams” and “large quantities of prostate tissue,” which is insufficient to determine the sample type.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn” and attributes observed irregularities to “technical difficulties” and “faulty processing.” No definitive benign or malignant diagnosis is provided.	: No  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is mentioned or can be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “grandular” (should be “glandular”) and awkward phrasing like “conclusions cannot be conclusively drawn.”
20	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “8 representative prostate systematic biopsies from typical locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  	: Partially  	: The report states that the focus is “too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma” and that the diagnosis is “uncertain although leaning towards benign.” This means malignancy has neither been confirmed nor ruled out; the findings are inconclusive.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma was confirmed, no Gleason grade (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layperson.
21	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and “prostate tissue material,” but it does not specify the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The text only refers to “normal basal cells” and “suspicious formations” without confirming the presence or absence of malignancy. No diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign findings is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is available or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is generally clear and understandable, although slightly verbose. It is suitable for a lay reader with minimal effort.
22	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The statement describes “invasive tumor tissue” with “malignant focus” and gives a Gleason score, confirming that malignant findings are present.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason grading is explicitly given as “4+3,” from which the sum (7) can be directly inferred.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several non-standard or awkward word choices (“preparate,” “grandular,” “basis and the vehicles”). “Preparate” should be “specimen” or “preparation,” “grandular” should be “glandular,” and “basis and the vehicles” likely intends “base and seminal vesicles.” These issues do not render the text incomprehensible but could confuse a lay reader.
23	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section,” which implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement does not declare the findings malignant or benign. It only notes that “tubular structures of varying differentiation stages” are seen and that Gleason scores “could not be reliably assessed.” Without a clear statement of malignancy, the malignancy status cannot be determined.	: No  	: Although the text refers to “score 4 and score 3,” it explicitly says these “could not be reliably assessed” and provides no actual Gleason pattern assignments (major + minor = sum). Thus the required Gleason information is absent.	: Appropriate  	: The language is generally clear and understandable, even if slightly verbose. There are no major grammatical errors that would hinder comprehension by a lay reader.
24	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “electrosection shavings from the prostate” clearly indicates that the material is transurethral resection (TUR-P or TURP) chips.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “the material is classified as benign” explicitly states that no malignancy was found.  	: No  	: Because the findings are benign, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore no major, minor or sum scores are given.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains small grammatical issues: “consist” should be “consists” (subject-verb agreement) and “have been started in eight blocks” should probably read “have been embedded in eight blocks” or “have been started as eight blocks.”
25	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “suspected prostate cancer tissue” implies the material is tissue from the prostate, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.	: No  	: The statement only says the tissue is “suspected” of being cancer and that the high-resolution images are still in the queue. No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis has been rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The sentence structure is understandable and the terminology is suitable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “has been started in eight batches”) do not impede comprehension.
26	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	0	0	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate needle biopsies taken from the typical locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Yes	: The statement reports “carcinoma is observed” in sample B, confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes	: The Gleason score is provided as “Gleason score 5 … total Gleason stage being 9 (4+5)”. From this we can directly extract the pattern 4+5=9.	: Minor mistakes	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are small grammatical issues: “normal grandular structures” should be “normal glandular structures,” and “Gleason score 5” is redundant because the total Gleason stage is already given as 9 (4+5).
27	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples taken from typical locations in the prostate,” which implies prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The statement only refers to “irregularities” and a “suspicious pattern” that “warrant further inspection.” It does not confirm the presence of malignancy, nor does it state that the findings are benign. The outcome is explicitly deferred to further consultation, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices such as “a bit more total sample material” and “out of the ordinary inflammation” are acceptable in clinical narrative and do not impede comprehension.
28	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “a prostatetectomy preparate,” which clearly indicates a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The statement reports “some tumorous growth is observed peripherally” and “the found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The Gleason sum (7) is given, and the major pattern (3) is stated to constitute ≈60 % of the tumor. However, the minor pattern is not explicitly provided, so the exact major+minor=sum format cannot be fully reconstructed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: While the intended meaning is understandable, there are several grammatical and word-choice issues: “prostatetectomy preparate” should be “prostatectomy specimen,” “run on casettes” should be “processed in cassettes,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and “pos. surgical margins” should be “positive surgical margins.”
29	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate tissue” and “samples D-G, K-P, O-Q,” which implies a multi-part specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: While “special patterns of cell growth” are noted, no definitive diagnosis of malignancy (e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma) is given. The text explicitly says further investigation is needed and that no statement affecting intervention decisions can be made. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement.	: No  	: The only mention of Gleason is an anecdotal comparison to “a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient.” No actual Gleason grade (major + minor = sum) is provided for the current specimen, nor can it be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“run on casettes,” “through-out sampling”) and minor grammatical issues (“seminal vehicle” likely meant “seminal vesicle”). These do not render it incomprehensible, but a careful copy-edit would improve clarity.
30	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	0	0	: Yes	: The phrase “Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g” clearly indicates that the material is transurethral resection (TUR-P) chips, so the sample type can be assessed.	: Yes	: The statement explicitly says “scopic inspection … does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material,” so malignancy is unequivocally established.	: Partially	: The text gives “Gleason 4 being the most represented … leading to a sum of 8.” This implies a pattern 4+4=8, but the minor pattern is not explicitly stated. Therefore the full major+minor=sum triplet can only be inferred, not directly read.	: Appropriate	: The wording is understandable to a lay reader despite minor stylistic quirks (“scopic inspection through the shavings”). No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
31	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate tissue material” and that it has been “processed,” but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue,” not the specific type.	: No  	: The text explicitly says that “representative Gleason or other marker could not be determined at this time” and that the suspicion of adenocarcinoma “was not based on any histopathology.” Thus, no malignant (or benign) histopathologic finding has been confirmed; only a clinical suspicion is reported.	: No  	: Because no malignant histopathologic finding has been established, no Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted. The mention of a “Gleason sum of 8 or above / ISUP GG of 4 or above” is explicitly tied to clinical notes, not to histopathologic assessment.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“totalling to a very meager weight comprise the sample material,” “Preliminary scopic inspection,” “adenocaricoma”). These minor grammatical and spelling issues do not render it incomprehensible, but a lay reader might find the wording stilted.
32	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as targeted (MRI-fusion) prostate biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “approximately half contains carcinoma focuses” and describes carcinoma lengths and architectural patterns, confirming the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  	: Yes  	: The report provides the relative proportions of Gleason pattern 3 (≈2/3) and pattern 4 (≈1/3) within the carcinoma, allowing the Gleason score to be inferred as 3 + 4 = 7.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “level 3 grade growth” instead of “Gleason grade 3”) do not impede comprehension.
33	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “multiple suspicious foci from the prostate” but never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further precision.	: Partially  	: The text repeatedly refers to “suspicious foci,” “various grades of cell differentiation,” and “mid-grade differentiation,” strongly implying malignancy. However, it never unequivocally states “adenocarcinoma” or “malignant,” so the malignancy status remains partially assessable.	: No  	: Although the authors speculate about possible Gleason patterns (3+4 or 4+3), they explicitly declare that assigning explicit scores is “inconclusive” and that grading “ought to be conducted manually.” Thus no actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or reliably inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is generally clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “differentation” instead of “differentiation,” “reliable assess” instead of “reliably assess”) do not impede comprehension.
34	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text describes “multiple clear foci” with “the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3,” confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: While the dominant pattern is stated as grade 4 and some grade 3 is present, the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not given, so the full Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be precisely reconstructed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues (e.g., “preparate” should be “specimen,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and “basis” should be “base”).
35	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples A-D … E-F … G-N … N-O” and refers to “right side of the prostate” versus “left side,” implying that the material is a multi-site prostate specimen. However, it never explicitly states whether the specimen comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  	: No  	: The text explicitly says that the tissue “likely allows assessment … Gleason between 3 to 5 are at all present or if the material is fully healthy.” This wording indicates that malignancy has not yet been determined; the examination is still pending. Therefore, we cannot assess whether malignant findings are present.  	: No  	: Because malignancy itself has not been confirmed, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or can be inferred. The mention of “Gleason between 3 to 5” is speculative and refers only to the potential range that might be evaluated later.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing such as “basis toward apex,” “status assessment of seminal vehicles” (likely meant “seminal vesicles”), and “will be held out as an assignment.” These minor grammatical and word-choice issues slightly hinder clarity but do not render the statement incomprehensible.
36	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure,” which clearly indicates the sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) chippings.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “a small fraction appears to be carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason sum of 7 is provided, and the text mentions that “the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area.” From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason pattern 4 (the “larger fraction”) plus pattern 3, giving 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor scores are not explicitly written, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology (e.g., “chippings,” “carcinoma,” “Gleason sum 7”). No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
37	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “standard prostate related procedures” and “12 tissue batches,” which implies a biopsy set, but it never explicitly names the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: Partially  	: The text states that “5% … might contain … ISUP GG 1 or above,” which clearly indicates suspicion of malignancy. However, it simultaneously says the focus is “too small to properly assign a grade group,” leaving the malignancy status uncertain rather than definitively confirmed.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, and the text explicitly refuses to assign a grade group because the suspicious focus is too small. Thus, Gleason scores cannot be extracted or inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman, with only minor stylistic quirks (e.g., “stand out,” “warrants further investigation”). No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
38	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as prostate biopsies.	: Yes  	: The statement reports that sample 4 “appears to contain adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding. Samples 2 and 3 are described as “healthy benign prostate tissue,” and sample 1 is “unrepresentative,” so the malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given as “Gleason 3, approx 90%” and “Gleason 4, 10%.” From this we can infer the major pattern is 3, the minor pattern is 4, and the sum is 3 + 4 = 7.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “grandular” instead of “glandular”) do not impede comprehension.
39	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate tissue processed as per routine for the specific sample type” but never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or another source. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a clear procedural origin.  	: Partially  	: Samples 1–3 are explicitly described as benign or unrepresentative. Sample 4 is flagged as having “cell architectures that may differ from normal prostate tissue” and is “possibly malignant,” but the pathologist explicitly states uncertainty and postpones any malignant confirmation pending verification of a potential lab mishap. Thus malignancy cannot be definitively assessed at this stage.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which these scores could be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable to a lay reader. Domain-specific phrasing such as “cell architectures” and “lab trajectory” is acceptable in a pathology context.
40	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly identifies the specimen as a “prostatectomy resection” and mentions that it has been divided into six macrosections and the usual microscopic sections. This clearly indicates the sample type.	: Yes  	: The text states that “samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: Two distinct Gleason scores are provided: “Gleason 3+4” for the apex and “class 4+4” for the basis. These are valid Gleason patterns expressed in the required major+minor=sum format (3+4=7 and 4+4=8).	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, professional, and understandable to a layman. Minor stylistic choices such as “class 4+4” instead of “Gleason 4+4” are acceptable within the histopathology domain.
41	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “obtained prostate tissue samples” and lists six sets from apex, middle and basis regions, which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.), so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that “examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region” and that the tissue has been “highly affected.” No malignant or benign diagnosis is provided; the case is declared uninterpretable because of prior treatments. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: Although the text hypothetically mentions “lower level Gleason (such as 3+4),” it immediately negates any actual determination: “examination … is impossible.” No concrete Gleason pattern is given, so the score cannot be extracted.	: Appropriate  	: The language is formal and somewhat verbose, but it is grammatically correct and understandable to a lay reader.
42	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly mentions “prostate chippings” and gives a weight (≈19 g), which is typical terminology for TURP (transurethral resection) chips. Thus the sample type is identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The description explicitly refers to “poorly differentiated growth,” “enlargened nuclei,” visible nucleoli, and “tumor-like tissue,” all consistent with malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The text states “most common Gleason grading as 5 and second most common as 4.” From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 5+4=9 (or 4+5=9), but the exact major/minor pattern assignment is not spelled out, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman, with only minor non-standard phrasing such as “enlargened” (should be “enlarged”) and “carpet-like,” which are acceptable in histopathology reports.
43	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “extracted prostate material” and “fragments,” which implies a fragmented specimen (likely TURP chips or biopsy cores), but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly states that nuclei are dissolved, technical noise is high, and cell differentiation patterns cannot be assessed. No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; instead, the case is deferred pending additional QC. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or inferable. The deferral for QC makes Gleason assessment irrelevant at this stage.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues: “half been put to histology” should read “half has been submitted for histology,” and “contain too noisy material” should be “contains material that is too noisy.” These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are not fully polished.
44	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate thick needle biopsies from both side,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies taken from both the left and right sides of the prostate.  	: Yes  	: The report states that the left-side fragments show “low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures” and mentions Gleason patterns 3 and 4, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The right-side fragments are explicitly said to show no malignancy. Thus, malignancy status is clearly assessable.  	: Partially  	: The text indicates “Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4,” which implies a Gleason pattern 3+4=7. However, it does not explicitly state the major and minor pattern order (i.e., whether 3 is primary or secondary). Therefore, while the sum can be inferred, the exact major/minor breakdown is not unambiguously provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is understandable and largely appropriate for a lay reader, although minor stylistic issues exist (e.g., “differentation” should be “differentiation,” “both side” should be “both sides,” and “score 3 and secondly of score 4” could be clearer as “Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
45	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate tissue sampling material” and describes bilateral fragments (“left side … right side”), so the sample type (bilateral prostate biopsies) is clearly identifiable.	: No  	: The report states that malignancy “cannot be assessed” because of fragmentation, wide variation in differentiation, and the need for reprocessing. Thus, no malignant or benign status is established.	: No  	: The text explicitly says “Assigning a Gleason … proves to be exceptionally difficult” and that the samples “cannot be assessed for malignancies.” Therefore, no Gleason pattern or score can be extracted.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable, uses standard medical terminology, and conveys the intended message clearly to both professionals and informed laypersons.
46	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Sections from a prostatectomy preparate” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that the sections “present an adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding.	: Yes  	: The report gives the primary pattern as “differentiation stage 4 (60%)” and the secondary pattern as “stage 5 (approx 30%)”, which translates to Gleason patterns 4 and 5. The tertiary grade 3 is noted as “diminishingly small,” so it does not alter the Gleason score. The conclusion explicitly states “Gleason-score sum 9,” which matches 4 + 5 = 9.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor stylistic quirks (“prostatectomy preparate,” “differentiation stage 4”). No information is lost, and a lay reader could grasp the key points.
47	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “parts of a prepared sample set” and “multiple macro sections and microscopic runs,” which implies that the material is some form of prostate tissue specimen (likely biopsies or TURP chips), but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not clearly assessed.	: Partially  	: The statement refers to “potential Gleason 3 findings” in an earlier incomplete report, indicating that malignancy is suspected but not yet confirmed in the current examination. Because the current examination itself does not provide a definitive malignant finding, malignancy status remains partially assessable.	: Partially  	: A prior report is said to have “potential Gleason 3 findings.” This suggests a Gleason pattern 3 component, but no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum is given. Thus, while a Gleason 3 component is hinted at, the full Gleason score (major + minor = sum) cannot be reliably extracted from the statement.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are generally clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “would've been located”) are acceptable in this context and do not impede comprehension.
48	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “turp-chippings,” which clearly identifies the sample type as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) material.	: Yes  	: The text states that “over 50% of the chippings present … Gleason 4-class tumor growth” and concludes with “sum 8 adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.	: Partially  	: A total (sum) Gleason score of 8 is provided, but the individual major and minor pattern scores are not explicitly stated. One can only infer that the major pattern is 4 (since 50 % of the tumour is Gleason 4) and the minor pattern is likely 4 as well (to reach the sum of 8), yet this is an inference rather than an explicit report.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several spelling/grammatical issues: “comfirmatory” → “confirmatory,” “melding” → “melding of glandular acini,” “grandular” → “glandular,” “chronically inflammated” → “chronically inflamed.” These do not impede comprehension but should be corrected for clarity.
49	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsies, radical prostatectomies or shavings,” so the sample types are clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The statement indicates that the original diagnoses were benign, but some cases were upgraded to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4. However, it does not provide a clear count or proportion of malignant findings versus benign, making a definitive assessment of malignancy status only partial.	: Partially  	: Gleason scores (3+3 and 3+4) are mentioned, but they are given as examples of upgrades rather than as a complete set of scores for all cases. Thus, the full Gleason information (major+minor=sum) cannot be assessed for every sample.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and phrasing are generally clear and understandable, though slightly verbose. Minor stylistic improvements could be made (e.g., “shavings” might be better specified as “TURP shavings”), but overall it is appropriate for a lay reader.
50	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “tissue cylinders” and gives their lengths, which is the classic way core-needle biopsies are described. No other specimen types (TURP chips, RP slices, etc.) are mentioned, so the sample type can be confidently identified as biopsies.	: Yes  	: The report clearly states “presence of prostate adenocarcinoma” and describes tumour growth in samples (1) and (2). Sample (3) is explicitly benign. Therefore malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Partially  	: Percentages of Gleason patterns 4 and 3 are given for each positive core, but the statement does not translate these percentages into the conventional major + minor = sum format (e.g., 4 + 3 = 7). One can infer that the dominant pattern is 4 in both cores, so the most likely score is 4 + 3 = 7, yet this is an inference rather than an explicit statement, hence only “Partially”.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathological phrasing. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “differentation stage” should be “differentiation grade”, “3 stage” should be “pattern 3”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
51	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions three numbered “samples” and refers to “measurable dimensions” and “fragmented tissue material,” which implies that the material is some form of histological specimen (likely biopsies). However, it never explicitly states the sample type (e.g., needle biopsies, TUR-P chips, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The final sentence explicitly says that “presence or absence of prostate adenocarcinoma cannot be reliably verified.” Consequently, no malignant (or benign) status can be assigned from the report.	: No  	: Although the text mentions “Gleason differentiation patterns” in sample (1), it immediately adds that “due to differing views this case will be discussed at next uro-meeting.” No actual Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided, and the conclusion is that malignancy cannot be verified, so no Gleason information can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“consistent of fragmented tissue material” should be “consisted of”; “approximately all of it could be assessed” is vague). These issues are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but a lay reader might find the wording slightly confusing.
52	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatectomy preparate” and describes the sampling scheme (apex, basis, seminal vesicles), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Yes  	: The text states that “histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor,” confirming the presence of malignancy (prostate adenocarcinoma).	: Partially  	: The dominant Gleason pattern is given as “class 3” and pattern 4 is described as “almost as prevalent,” but no explicit minor pattern or summed Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7) is provided. Therefore, the exact major+minor=sum format cannot be fully inferred without making assumptions.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but contains non-standard phrasing such as “preparate” (should be “specimen/preparation”), “basis” (should be “base”), “seminal vehicles” (should be “seminal vesicles”), and “class 3 and class 4 differentation” (should be “Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4 differentiation”). These minor wording issues do not impede overall comprehension.
53	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states that “the studied material originates from the prostate” and that it is “processed according to the usual processing procedures and markings.” These phrases clearly indicate that the sample type is prostate tissue, most likely a radical prostatectomy specimen (apex vs. base orientation is described).  	: Partially  	: The text mentions “possible ‘Gleason sum 7’” but immediately qualifies it as “unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified.” Because the histology is described as “very difficult to assess” owing to recent radiation therapy, the malignancy status is not definitively confirmed; it is only suggested.  	: No  	: Although a “Gleason sum 7” is referenced, neither the major (primary) nor the minor (secondary) Gleason pattern is provided, nor can they be reliably inferred. The statement explicitly questions the validity of the score, so the required format (major+minor=sum) cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is clear and understandable; the phrasing is slightly formal but remains accessible to a lay reader.
54	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “shavings” is a colloquial synonym for trans-urethral resection (TURP) chips, so the sample type can be inferred as TURP.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Carcinoma was histologically detected,” confirming a malignant finding.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “3+3=6,” providing major, minor, and sum scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman; only “shavings” is slightly informal but common in pathology reports.
55	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “source prostate tissue” suggests the material is prostate-derived, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.	: Partially  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatic tissue material” in samples F and G, but it does not clearly declare whether malignant (adenocarcinoma) or benign findings were present. The remark that “growth patterns … did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation” is ambiguous—it neither confirms malignancy nor benignity. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: Although a “Gleason score 3” is mentioned, it is qualified as “debatably … maybe … in small quantities,” with no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum provided. Consequently, a standard Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be reliably extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is generally understandable, but phrases such as “Total dozen grams” and “run in eight batches” are awkward. “Total dozen grams” should probably read “a total of twelve grams,” and “run in eight batches” could be clearer as “processed in eight batches.”
56	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “six biopsy cylinders,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core prostate biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text describes three separate foci of adenocarcinoma, explicitly labeling them as malignant. There is no ambiguity about the presence of cancer.  	: Yes  	: Each malignant focus is accompanied by a complete Gleason score in the standard major+minor=sum format: 4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable to a layman despite minor stylistic quirks (e.g., “point sum” instead of “score,” “Focus 3#” instead of “Focus #3”). The meaning remains clear and no significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
57	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “six different sites of interest” and refers to “front left”, “middle left”, and “middle right”, which strongly implies a multi-site biopsy set. However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively confirmed.	: No  	: While atypical growth patterns and “possible pre-malignant changes” are described, the report explicitly states that material is being sent for further evaluation and that differentiation staging is “unclear”. No definitive malignant diagnosis (adenocarcinoma) is rendered; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement alone.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a lay reader. Minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “hyperlastic changes”) is acceptable in a pathology context.
58	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	0	0	: Partially  	: The text mentions “Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen” and describes systematic sampling from apex to base, but it never explicitly states whether the specimen is from a radical prostatectomy, TURP, or biopsy. The sampling pattern (multiple transverse planes with left/right lobes) is consistent with a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only inferred, not declared.  	: Yes  	: The statement clearly reports “invasive adenocarcinoma” in the left-lobe sections (cassettes A and C) and mentions additional malignant features such as capsular penetration and perineural invasion. Thus, malignancy is unambiguously established.  	: Partially  	: A total Gleason score of 7 is explicitly given (“SUMMARY: Score sum 7”). However, the individual pattern scores are ambiguous: the text states “mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4,” which is contradictory and does not allow reliable extraction of distinct primary and secondary grades (e.g., 4+3=7 or 3+4=7). Therefore, the exact major+minor breakdown cannot be determined.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues: “fused grandular structures” should read “fused glandular structures,” and “casettes” should be “cassettes.” Additionally, the phrase “with the smaller portion as grade 4” is redundant and confusing because both portions are described as grade 4. These issues do not render the text incomprehensible but could be improved for clarity.
59	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “fresh prostate tissue material” and lists six separately labeled sites (A–F) that correspond to a systematic, multi-site sampling pattern typical of prostate biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsies, TURP chips, radical prostatectomy slices, etc.) is never explicitly named, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: The text never states whether malignant (adenocarcinoma) or benign findings were identified. It only notes that samples A and C contain “non-prostatic tissue” and that “capsule penetration, perineural invasion, or differentiation stages of tumor cells cannot be assessed.” Because malignancy status is neither confirmed nor denied, the malignancy of findings cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: The summary explicitly says “Score sum determination was not possible,” and no Gleason pattern information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or inferable from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains awkward phrasing (“sampling procedure had something that was contaminated,” “fusing grandular structure”) and minor grammatical issues (“grandular” should be “glandular,” “SUMMARY” is capitalized mid-sentence). These flaws do not render the text incomprehensible, but they could be polished for clarity.
60	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	0	0	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells,” which strongly implies TUR-P (transurethral resection) chippings, but the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: Yes  	: The pathologists explicitly confirm the presence of “moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma” and provide Gleason patterns 4 and 3 (with tertiary 5), so malignancy is clearly established.  	: Yes  	: The text gives the major pattern 4 and secondary pattern 3, yielding a revised Gleason score 4+3=7 (Grade Group 3). Although a tertiary pattern 5 is mentioned, it does not alter the primary Gleason score reported.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and largely appropriate for a layman, despite minor stylistic quirks (“chippings,” “diffentiation”). The key medical facts are conveyed clearly.
61	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	0	1	: No  	: The statement mentions “APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION” but never specifies whether the tissue examined came from prostate biopsies, TURP chips, radical-prostatectomy, or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: The text explicitly states that the experts “could not confirm or deny the suspicions” and that “the earlier uncertain diagnosis … could therefore not be determined.” Because malignancy status remains undetermined, it is impossible to assess whether malignant findings are present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy itself is unconfirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is clear and understandable; while the phrasing is slightly formal and the use of initials (“JD & JD”) is domain-specific, it remains comprehensible to a lay reader.
62	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “routine systematic biopsy” and “two targeted biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The text describes malignant findings in both the initial biopsy (“minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6”) and the second targeted biopsy (“large focus … primary differentiation pattern 4 … second most common differentiation pattern is 5”), confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.	: Partially  	: The initial biopsy gives a complete Gleason score (3+3=6). For the second targeted biopsy, only the primary pattern (4) and the second most common pattern (5) are stated; no explicit sum is provided. While one can reasonably infer a sum of 9 (4+5=9), the statement does not explicitly state this, so the assessment is only partial.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layman despite some domain-specific phrasing.
63	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	0	1	: No  	: The statement mentions that “samples were taken” after imaging, but it never specifies the type of tissue (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: The text only says “suspicious findings” and that “interpretation of tissue proved difficult.” It explicitly states that the findings are inconclusive and that additional samples are needed. Hence malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable to a lay reader, but contains small grammatical issues (“Patient undergone” should be “Patient has undergone,” “5 % ot” should be “5 % of,” etc.). These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
64	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions that the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement confirms the presence of multifocal prostate adenocarcinoma in the original prostate tissue, so malignancy is clearly established.	: Partially  	: The statement lists several Gleason patterns (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3) observed in the prostate tissue, but it does not provide a single, definitive Gleason score (major+minor=sum) for the overall tumor. Instead, it describes multiple patterns, making it impossible to extract one definitive score.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is well-structured, grammatically correct, and uses terminology understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge.
65	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “original primary prostate tissue” and “lymph nodes and seminal vesicles,” which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.  	: No  	: The statement only says that “findings … remain” and that “lymph nodes and seminal vesicles … were clear.” It does not confirm whether prostate adenocarcinoma was present or absent; it merely reports that nodes and seminal vesicles were negative. Thus malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not mentioned and cannot be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is understandable and suitable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “from one sample to other”) do not impede comprehension.
66	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3,” confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Additional evidence includes capsular penetration and a positive lymph-node finding (1/4, N1).  	: Partially  	: Two different Gleason patterns are reported (“3+4/4+3”), but no single definitive score (major+minor=sum) is given. One can infer that at least one focus is Gleason 3+4=7 and another is 4+3=7, yet the statement does not provide a single, unambiguous overall Gleason score for the case.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues: “preparate” should be “specimen” or “preparation,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and the phrase “View specific information from the additional details of the report” is awkward.
67	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	0	1	: No  	: The statement never specifies what kind of tissue was examined (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). It only mentions “collected samples” and “processed samples” without naming the specimen type.	: No  	: While it explicitly says “No malignant findings in seminal vesicles,” it does not state whether the prostate tissue itself was examined or whether any prostate adenocarcinoma was found. The phrase “possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes” is too vague to confirm or rule out malignancy.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which these could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles”) and vague wording (“pathological findings vary”). These are minor issues that do not render the statement incomprehensible.
68	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	0	0	: Partially  	: The text mentions “a resection weighing 7.5 g” and “six tissue cassettes”, which strongly suggests a transurethral resection (TURP) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma” and “no malignities”, so the absence of malignancy is clearly conveyed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is ruled out, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman, with only minor stylistic quirks (“malignities” instead of “malignancies”).
69	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “the presented sample” and describes its preparation into six tissue cassettes, but it never explicitly states what type of specimen it is (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not clearly assessed.  	: No  	: The phrase “Findings do not indicate prostatic” is ambiguous and appears to be a mistranslation or typo. The subsequent description of “hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation” explicitly labels the findings as benign. No mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant process is provided, so malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable overall, but contains grammatical issues such as “Histologically can be seen” (should be “Histologically, it can be seen”) and the unclear phrase “do not indicate prostatic.” These are minor and do not render the statement incomprehensible, but they could confuse a lay reader.
70	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly identifies the samples as “representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe,” so the sample type is clearly stated.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “No signs of carcinoma,” which directly conveys that no malignant findings were identified. High-grade PIN is noted, but PIN is not considered carcinoma.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not applicable; therefore no Gleason scores (major+minor=sum) can be provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear, concise, and easily understandable by a layman. Minor domain-specific terms (e.g., “high-grade PIN”) are acceptable in this context.
71	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples from left and right lobe,” which strongly implies needle biopsies, but the exact sample type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. RP) is never explicitly stated.  	: No  	: Only high-grade PIN (a precursor lesion) and benign hyperplasia are described. There is no mention of invasive carcinoma, so malignancy cannot be confirmed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a layman, but “abserved” should be “observed,” and “high-grade PIN-changes” would read more naturally as “high-grade PIN changes.”
72	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	0	0	: Partially  	: The text mentions “preparate” (specimen) and gives weight and dimensions (80 g, 7 × 6 × 5 cm), which are typical for a TURP or radical prostatectomy, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “No signs of malignity,” which clearly conveys that no malignant findings were present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard wording (“preparate” instead of “specimen,” “macro casettes” instead of “macro cassettes,” “malignity” instead of “malignancy”). These are minor domain-specific or spelling issues that do not impede comprehension.
73	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “8 macro cassettes and 5 regular cassettes,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type, so the information is only partially inferable.  	: No  	: The statement only describes benign changes (“nodular hyperplasia,” “epithelial hyperplasia”) and explicitly says the microscopic assessment “was not assessed reliably.” There is no mention of malignancy, so malignancy status cannot be determined.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The sentence structure is understandable, but it contains minor grammatical issues such as “macro casettes” (should be “macro cassettes”) and “microscopically epithelial hyperplasia” (better phrased as “microscopically, epithelial hyperplasia was observed”).
74	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “electrosection chippings” clearly indicates that the material is transurethral resection (TURP) chippings, so the sample type can be assessed.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly mentions only benign changes (“nodular gland components”, “hyperplasia”) and does not mention any malignant findings such as prostate adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; “preparate” is slightly non-standard but acceptable in pathology reports.
75	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “total sample material” and “prostate tissue,” which implies the specimen is from the prostate, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The report describes “prostate tissue with partial nodular gland components” and “minor inflammation,” but it does not confirm or exclude malignancy. It explicitly says “further examination was not possible at this time,” so malignancy status remains undetermined.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but contains non-standard phrasing such as “preparated” (should be “prepared”) and “nodular glandcomponents” (should be “nodular gland components”). These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension.
76	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “needle biopsies” as the sample type, which is a standard histopathology specimen.  	: Yes  	: The report clearly states that “no suspected malignity” was found, thereby confirming benign findings and ruling out malignancy.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy was detected, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores are provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise, grammatically correct, and easily understandable to a lay reader.
77	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Representative samples are collected” implies that tissue has been obtained, but it does not specify whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined.  	: No  	: The statement mentions only “hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation,” which are benign findings. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any other malignancy, so malignancy status cannot be assessed as present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a lay reader, although “some finding including” could be more smoothly phrased as “some findings, including…”.
78	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “a prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “a tumor with 3 foci” was found and describes the differentiation stages as “Gleason 3 (major) and 4 … therefore Gleason grade is 7.” This confirms the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The wording “Gleason 3 (major) and 4 … therefore Gleason grade is 7” directly translates to Gleason 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “preparate” instead of “specimen,” “run according to normal routine”). These quirks do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
79	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	0	1	: No  	: The text mentions “some slices extracted” and “remaining tissue,” but it never specifies whether the specimen came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be determined.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings.” Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status is unassessable.  	: No  	: The text states “Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point,” so no Gleason information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a lay reader despite the slightly informal phrasing (“run according to normal routine”). No major grammatical errors impede comprehension.
80	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “shaving material” is a common synonym for transurethral resection (TURP) chips, so the sample type can be confidently identified as TURP.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “No atypical or invasive epithelial growth” and concludes with “Benign prostate hyperplasia,” confirming that no malignancy is present.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing such as “set on eight casettes” (intended: “placed in eight cassettes”) does not impede comprehension.
81	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “8 casettes” and “Examined material weights 8.9”, which strongly implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly says “hyperplastic prostate” and “at least inflammation, but possibly something else. Further examination is needed.” No malignant diagnosis is given, and the findings are explicitly left open; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “weights” should be “weighs”, “casettes” should be “cassettes”, and the ellipsis (“……”) is informal. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are not fully standard.
82	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “systematic biopsies from the right and left lobe,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “No signs of prostate cancer in the material” unequivocally indicates that no malignant findings were present.  	: No  	: Because no prostate cancer was found, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is grammatically correct and easily understandable to a lay reader.
83	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples … from left and right lobes of prostate,” which implies a biopsy setting, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (e.g., needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says it is “hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not,” so no malignant findings are confirmed. The description only lists benign changes (chronic inflammation, atrophic glands). Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a lay reader; no significant errors are present.
84	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	0	0	: Yes  	: The term “Prostatectomy preparate” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly describes malignant findings: “Gleason grade 4 differentiation … small amount of Gleason 3” and assigns a Gleason score, confirming adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The text states “score 7 (4+3)”, which directly gives the major pattern (4), minor pattern (3), and sum (7).  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues: “preparate” should be “specimen”, “invastigated” should be “investigated”, and “seen Gleason grade 4 differentiation” would read more naturally as “Gleason grade 4 differentiation is seen”.
85	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Prostate sample weighing app 8?” suggests a radical-prostatectomy specimen (because weight is typically recorded for whole prostates), but the wording is vague and the question mark makes it uncertain.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states that it “cannot be determined” whether the observed changes are cancer or inflammation, so malignancy status is indeterminate.  	: No  	: Since malignancy itself cannot be confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The sentence structure is understandable, but “weighing app 8?” is non-standard and should read “weighing approximately 8 g” or similar.
86	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	43	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly indicates that the material consists of “prostate chippings” (i.e., TURP chips) and that these were processed in cassettes A–H. This is sufficient to identify the sample type as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “no signs of prostatic adenocarcinoma in the material,” confirming that the findings are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, it cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable, using standard histopathology phrasing. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Approx 30g”) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
87	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	43	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and “placed in cassettes and in the jar,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but the exact sample type is not explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The text explicitly says “no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached,” so malignancy status remains undetermined.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a lay reader; minor stylistic issues (“in the jar”) are acceptable in routine pathology reports.
88	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies,” which clearly identifies the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The report states that “no tumor tissue can be seen,” confirming the absence of malignancy in the current material.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant tissue is found, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and largely correct, although “inflamation” should be spelled “inflammation.” This is a minor orthographic error that does not impede comprehension.
89	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Representative prostate samples according to standard routine” suggests that the material is prostate tissue taken for diagnostic purposes, but it does not explicitly state whether the samples are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.  	: No  	: The report explicitly says “Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes.” This means the current examination neither confirms nor rules out malignancy. Consequently, the malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement alone.  	: No  	: Because no malignant findings are confirmed in the current examination, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (“inflamation” should be “inflammation”; “atrophy” could read “focal atrophy”) do not impede comprehension.
90	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “whole prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Yes  	: The presence of “fusing tumor tissue focus,” “classes 3+4,” and “perineural invasion” unequivocally indicates malignant findings (prostate adenocarcinoma).	: Yes  	: The text states “classes 3+4” and “tissue gleason 3,” from which the Gleason score can be inferred as 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). Although the wording is slightly non-standard (“classes” instead of “pattern”), the intended major and minor grades are unambiguous.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are small grammatical and terminological issues: “preparate” should be “specimen,” “tissue gleason 3” should read “tissue Gleason grade 3,” and “negative marginals” should be “negative margins.” These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
91	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “a suspect prostate sample” and lists middle sections (E, F, G) as well as sections O and P, implying a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The statement repeatedly stresses that the structure is “unclear,” “not able to detect,” and that “further inspection is needed.” No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: Because no cancer diagnosis is confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is given or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “capsel” should be “capsule,” “marginals” should be “margins,” and some sentences are slightly awkward). These do not prevent comprehension but could be improved for clarity.
92	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “shaved prostate chippings,” which is a clear description of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. The total weight (~20 g) and the fact that the material was set on eight cassettes further confirm this sample type.  	: Yes  	: The report states “No signs of prostate cancer in the material,” which directly indicates that malignant findings were absent. The only described findings are benign (regular prostate tissue and basal cell hyperplasia).  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) can be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable. Minor stylistic points: “run” could be replaced with “processed,” and “gland findings coincide with basal cell hyperplasia” might read more smoothly as “glandular changes consistent with basal cell hyperplasia,” but these are small issues that do not impede comprehension.
93	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate material” and that it was “set on cassettes,” which implies a histopathology specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, but the exact type remains unclear.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Not able to assess whether there is cancer related changes or not.” Consequently, no definitive malignant or benign conclusion is provided.  	: No  	: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is given or can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman despite minor stylistic quirks (e.g., “run” instead of “processed”). The message is clear and does not contain major grammatical errors.
94	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsies” and specifies their origin (“right” and “left”), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as prostate needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states “No malign findings on the left or the right,” which directly conveys that no malignant tissue was identified; hence the malignancy status is assessable as benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason score can or should be provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and largely correct. The only minor deviation is the spelling “lymfocytic” instead of “lymphocytic,” which is a trivial orthographic variation and does not impede comprehension.
95	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatic material” and refers to “right and the left,” which implies a paired‐side specimen typical of needle biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so only a partial assessment is possible.	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly writes “Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right.” This directly negates any ability to assess malignancy status; the findings are inconclusive rather than benign.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is understandable and largely correct. Minor non-standard phrasing such as “malign findings” instead of “malignant findings” is acceptable in pathology reports.
96	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “prostate resection” (radical prostatectomy) and describes the systematic sampling of apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that “adenocarcinoma” was found in two macro sections, lists tumor locations, and notes adverse features such as capsule invasion and perineural growth.  	: Yes  	: The text gives the two most common Gleason patterns for each focus (4+3 and 5+4) and explicitly concludes with “Gleason 9 tumor,” which corresponds to the sum of the highest-grade focus (5+4=9).  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is clear, but there are small grammatical issues (“accourding” → “according”; “first discovered tumor focus' most common Gleason” → “first discovered tumor focus’s most common Gleason pattern”). These do not impede comprehension.
97	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies” and describes the preparation of apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles on separate cassettes, which clearly identifies the sample type as autopsy prostate tissue.  	: Partially  	: The text states that “some exemplifying histological changes are seen” and calls them “interesting findings,” but it neither confirms nor denies malignancy; it only rules out deriving differentiation scores. Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully assessed.  	: No  	: The summary explicitly says “this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5),” so no Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) can be extracted.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear and understandable despite the parenthetical “(?)” and the slightly informal phrase “interesting patterns.” It conveys the intended message to a lay reader without major grammatical errors.
98	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly indicates that the material examined consists of “prostate chippings” and “90 shavings on 8 glasses,” which is typical terminology for TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimens.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “5 shavings contained carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: The Gleason pattern information is given qualitatively (“most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4”), which allows us to infer a Gleason score of 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor pattern assignments are not explicitly stated in the standard format, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (“rest of the prostate chippings”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not hinder comprehension.
99	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses” implies that the material is prostate tissue cut onto eight slides, but it does not explicitly state whether the source is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.  	: No  	: The statement mentions “some changes that warrant further investigation” but does not confirm malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or benignity. Because the findings are explicitly deferred due to technical limitations, no conclusion about malignancy can be drawn.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the vague description of “some changes.”  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable to a layman; grammar is acceptable despite the slightly informal “fifth glass” instead of “fifth slide.”
100	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Needle biopsies”, which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported: “Gleason 3+4” and “3+3 differentiation” are stated for several biopsy cores, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are given directly in the standard major+minor=sum format: “3+4” (sum 7) and “3+3” (sum 6). Additional descriptive details (e.g., cribriform pattern) do not prevent extraction of the scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “differentiation” instead of “Gleason score”) are acceptable in the domain and do not hinder comprehension.
101	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples” and “glasses” (glass slides) but does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). The mention of “right” and “left” suggests a bilateral procedure, most likely needle biopsies, yet this is only inferred, not explicitly declared.  	: No  	: The phrase “differentiation was found” is ambiguous; it is unclear whether it refers to malignant differentiation or simply tissue differentiation. The final sentence “Cannot determine the findings” explicitly states that malignancy cannot be confirmed. Therefore malignancy status is not assessable.  	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but uses non-standard phrasing such as “changes of length 8/12 mm” and “differentiation was found” without clear context. Rewriting for clarity (e.g., “In one core 8 mm of 12 mm shows altered differentiation”) would improve lay comprehension.
102	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy preparate as sample,” which clearly identifies the specimen type as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Microscopic examination reveals tumor tissue … Adenocarcinoma in both lobes,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The report gives the dominant pattern as Gleason 4 and the next most common as Gleason 5, with pattern 5 occupying ≈10 % of the surface. However, it does not provide the standard major + minor = sum format (e.g., 4+5=9 or 5+4=9). Therefore, while the Gleason patterns are described, the exact major/minor scores cannot be definitively extracted.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and largely appropriate, although “preparate” is non-standard (should be “specimen” or “preparation”). Minor stylistic issues like “builds separate, varying formations” could be phrased more smoothly, but overall the statement is comprehensible to both professionals and informed laypersons.
103	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples are prepared into cassettes” and refers to “both lobes” and “entire surface,” which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the actual word “biopsy,” “TURP,” or “radical prostatectomy” is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly assessed.	: No  	: Although the description speaks of “invasive” gland-forming structures occupying ≈20 % of the surface, the sentence “due to the contamination unable to determine the nature of changes” explicitly negates any definitive malignant diagnosis. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can it be inferred, because the report explicitly declares itself unable to determine the nature of the changes.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains small grammatical slips (“in to cassettes” should be “into cassettes”; “some finding” should probably be “some findings”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
104	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostate shaving” clearly indicates that the specimen consists of transurethral resection (TURP/TUR-B) chippings; the mention of “chippings” and “weight around 10.5 g after fixation” further confirms the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “Gleason 3 and 4 differentiation seen” and describes “fused cribriform glands,” which are hallmarks of adenocarcinoma. Although the word “suspect” is used, the subsequent histological description and Gleason grading confirm malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The text gives both Gleason patterns (3 and 4) and indicates that pattern 4 is “slightly more common,” so we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+3=7. However, the exact major/minor assignment is not spelled out in the standard “major+minor=sum” format, hence only partial assessment is possible.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and largely appropriate for a pathology report. Minor stylistic issues (“Class 4 slightly more common” should probably read “Grade 4 slightly more common”) do not impede comprehension.
105	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Samples obtained through prostate samples” is awkward, but it clearly indicates that the material comes from the prostate. However, it does not specify whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue, so the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.	: Partially  	: The report mentions “small suspect findings” and describes “fused cribriform glands,” which are morphological features compatible with prostate adenocarcinoma. Yet it explicitly states that “due to the contamination of sample unable to determin the changes,” so malignancy cannot be definitively confirmed or ruled out.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can any be reliably inferred from the text. The description of “fused cribriform glands” is suggestive but not quantified into a Gleason score.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable overall, but it contains several grammatical and spelling errors (“cantamination,” “determin,” “urothelial metaplasia in the gland ducts” should probably be “urothelial metaplasia of the gland ducts”). These issues are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they could be improved for clarity.
106	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “10 biopsies and small tissue fragments,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “Five biopsies show cancer,” confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The Gleason scores are given for individual foci (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3) and summed (7 and 8), but the classic major+minor pattern (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+4=8) is not explicitly written. The reader can infer the pattern, so the information is only partially complete.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a typo (“tuomr” instead of “tumor”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“final sum is 8”). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
107	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Number of samples and small tissue fragments were collected” implies that some form of biopsy or resection material was received, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.  	: No  	: The statement says “Samples are contaminated and unable to deferentiate the findings.” This explicitly indicates that no reliable distinction between benign and malignant could be made. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Because malignancy itself could not be determined, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The intended meaning is understandable, but there are grammatical issues: “Number of samples” should be “A number of samples”; “into adipose tissue” should probably be “into adipose tissue”; and “deferentiate” is a misspelling of “differentiate.” These are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible.
108	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy under investigation,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “under microscope found tumor tissue” and later specifies “Adenocarcinoma covers ca 25 % of samples surface,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The report gives the dominant differentiation class as 4 and a smaller portion as class 3, implying a Gleason pattern 4+3=7. However, it does not explicitly state the major and minor patterns in the standard “major+minor=sum” format, so the score must be inferred rather than directly read.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and largely appropriate for a lay reader, although a few phrases (“converging gland ducts,” “basis slide”) are slightly non-standard. These do not impede overall comprehension.
109	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and describes how they are organised into macro slides taken from apex, basis and seminal vesicles, which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated (e.g. “radical prostatectomy” or “biopsy”), so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The text reports “suspicious changes of tissue” and “abnormalities”, but explicitly states that “determination of the changes is not possible” because of artifacts. Therefore malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings remain inconclusive.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern or score is provided, and the inability to determine the nature of the changes precludes any inference of Gleason grade.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but contains non-standard phrasing such as “macro slides”, “basis slide”, and “changes of tissue protrudes”. Minor grammatical corrections (e.g. “changes … protrude”, “basis slides”) would improve clarity for a lay reader.
110	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	0	0	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “shaving material” and that 4 g of it were embedded in 8 cassettes. This strongly suggests a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimen, but the exact sample type is not explicitly named, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Yes  	: The text clearly states “most is malignant differentiated prostate cancer,” so malignancy is unambiguously confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Gleason 5” as the dominant pattern and “small component of Gleason 4.” Interpreting these as the major and minor patterns yields a sum of 9, i.e., Gleason 5+4=9.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The meaning is understandable, but the phrasing is non-standard (“malignant differentiated prostate cancer,” “under microscope can be observed”). More idiomatic wording would be “poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma” and “on microscopy.”
111	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples on 8 cassettes” and gives a weight (≈4 g), which implies a TURP-type resection, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  	: No  	: The text only says “some suspicious changes” and “unable to determine at this point”. Suspicious is not a confirmed malignancy, and the conclusion explicitly states that malignancy cannot be determined. Hence malignancy status is not assessable.  	: No  	: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The meaning is understandable, but the phrasing is awkward (“Entire samples material is 5,7”, “approx 4 grams are taken as samples on 8 cassettes”). Corrected version: “The total specimen weight is 5.7 g; approximately 4 g were sampled into 8 cassettes.”
112	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly identifies the material as “systematic biopsies from the right and left lobes,” which is a clear description of the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The text states that biopsies 1–3 from the left side “show a carcinoid” and later confirms “cancer proportion of sample surface 20%,” unequivocally indicating malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The summary line gives “Total sum 3+3=6 on the left,” directly providing the major pattern (3), minor pattern (3), and sum (6).  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard terminology. The only minor point is the use of “carcinoid,” which in prostate pathology is usually referred to as “adenocarcinoma,” but the intended meaning is clear from the context.
113	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples 1-6” and gives their lengths, which strongly implies a multi-core needle-biopsy set. However, the word “biopsy” itself is never used, so the exact sample type is only implied rather than explicitly stated.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly says that “samples 4-6 show only benign prostate tissue.” Although the changes in samples 1-3 are left undetermined, the overall conclusion is that no malignancy was found in the examined material.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a lay reader, but contains spelling errors (“sampes” → “samples”, “cganges” → “changes”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“some sort of changes”).
114	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	0	0	: Yes	: The term “prostatectomy preparate” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions “tumor tissue found in the right apex,” confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes	: The text gives the dominant pattern as Gleason 3 (70 %), the secondary pattern as Gleason 4 (5–10 %), and a tertiary Gleason 5 (1 %). This translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7 (tertiary 5 noted but not added to the sum), so the major+minor=sum format can be inferred.	: Appropriate	: The wording is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (“preparate,” “class” instead of “pattern,” “ca” for “circa”). These are acceptable in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
115	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples” and “histological examination,” but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can infer that some tissue was examined, yet the exact nature of the sample remains unclear.	: No  	: The report describes “mostly benign hyperplastic prostate tissue” and “chronic inflammation,” but it also refers to a 3 × 5 mm focus with “merging glands.” The final sentence says “Unable to determine due to sample quality,” which explicitly indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out. Therefore, malignancy status is not assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the inability to determine malignancy precludes any inference of Gleason grading.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing such as “Samples preparate run” (likely intended as “Samples prepared according to normal protocol”) and “observed greatly in stroma” (probably “observed extensively in the stroma”). These minor grammatical issues do not render the statement incomprehensible, but they could be polished for clarity.
116	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate shavings” and gives the weight (20 g), which clearly identifies the specimen as transurethral resection (TURP) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states “histologically found … prostate cancer,” so malignancy is confirmed.  	: Partially  	: The description gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 3 (50 %) and 4 (~20 %), from which a Gleason score of 3+4=7 can be inferred. However, the exact major/minor pattern assignment is not spelled out in the standard “3+4=7” format, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “ca 20 %”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
117	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and that the material was placed in three cassettes, which implies a prostate specimen. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Unable to determine the findings.” Although chronic inflammation and atrophied acini are mentioned, these are benign changes and do not clarify whether malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present or absent. Therefore, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains a typo (“detemine” instead of “determine”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“Grams of prostate samples under investigation”). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
118	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsies from the right and left lobe,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states “a small focus of cancer is found,” confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason grade 3 is given for the cancer focus, but only the primary (major) pattern is provided. No secondary (minor) pattern is mentioned, so the full Gleason score (major + minor = sum) cannot be reconstructed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable and uses standard histopathology terminology; no significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
119	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples 1 and 2” and “other samples,” which implies that the material consists of multiple tissue pieces, most likely needle biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.  	: Partially  	: A “small focus of changes” is described in the left lobe, but the report explicitly says it is “unable to recognise the differentiation.” This means the pathologist could not determine whether the focus is benign or malignant. The phrase “no cancer cell tissue” in the other samples confirms that the remaining tissue is benign, yet the nature of the left-lobe focus remains undetermined. Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully assessed.  	: No  	: Because differentiation of the left-lobe focus is not recognised, no Gleason pattern (major or minor) or Gleason score is provided or can be inferred.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable but slightly telegraphic (e.g., “Total length around 60” should probably read “Total length around 60 mm”). A lay reader might need clarification on “unable to recognise the differentiation” and “cribriform growth” (which could be either benign or malignant).
120	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy operated preparate”, which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Findings represent prostate carcinoma” and describes carcinoma in both lobes, confirming a malignant diagnosis.  	: Partially  	: The report gives the dominant pattern (“mostly Gleason class 4”) and a secondary component (“10 % of tissue Gleason class 5”), but it does not explicitly state the major + minor = sum format (e.g., 4+5=9). One can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9, yet this is not directly provided.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“preparate”, “anteriorically”, “marginals”) and minor grammatical slips. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a polished version would improve clarity.
121	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “macro cassettes A-H” and “ordinary cassettes I-L”, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen (apex, base, research blocks). However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The sentence “Unable to determine the findings” explicitly states that malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded. Therefore malignancy status is not assessable.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains non-standard wording (“preparate sized”, “anteriorically changes”, “marginals”). Standard terms would be “preparation”, “anterior changes”, and “margins”.
122	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	0	0	: Partially  	: The phrase “Formalin fixated shavings” strongly suggests TUR-P (transurethral resection) material, but the statement never explicitly names the specimen type (biopsy, TUR-P, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Thus the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “tumor tissue in almost half of the shavings” and describes the tumour as “quite poorly differentiated,” confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The statement gives “Mostly seen Gleason class 4, smaller portion Gleason 5. Therefore sum is 9.” Interpreting “mostly” as the primary pattern (4) and “smaller portion” as the secondary pattern (5) yields a standard Gleason score 4+5=9.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“Formalin fixated shavings”, “Histologically can be seen”, “sum is 9” without explicitly stating “Gleason score”). These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
123	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “Formalin fixated samples” and “six cassettes,” which implies a tissue specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.  	: Partially  	: The statement says “quite poorly differentiated” changes and “small cribriform glands,” both of which are highly suggestive of malignancy. However, it also states that “unable to determin tha type of tissue changes,” so the report itself does not formally confirm malignancy. Thus malignancy can only be inferred, not fully assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor) or sum is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the vague wording “quite poorly differentiated.”  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a layman, but contains several minor grammatical errors: “fixated” should be “fixed,” “approx 15” should specify “15 g,” “Changes is” should be “Changes are,” “determin” should be “determine,” and “tha” should be “the.”
124	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions that the material consists of “representative biopsies from the right and left lobes,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “a small focus of prostate adenocarcinoma” and “another cancer focus” were found, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “Gleason sum 6 (3+3),” from which the major pattern (3) and minor pattern (3) can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear, concise, and easily understandable even to a non-specialist.
125	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “samples 1-6” and “right and left lobes,” which strongly implies a prostate biopsy set, but the word “biopsy” itself is never used, so the sample type is only partially ascertainable.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “no carcinoma,” which clearly conveys that no malignant findings were identified.	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, it cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a layman, but contains two spelling errors (“chnages” should be “changes,” and “determin” should be “determine”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
126	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATECTOMY REPORT,” which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The report states that three tumour foci were found, lists a Gleason score of 8, and describes tumour proportion and margin status. These details confirm the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Primary Gleason class: 4” and “Secondary Gleason class: 4,” from which the standard notation 4+4=8 can be directly inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable and uses terminology familiar to clinicians. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Seminel vesicle” instead of “seminal vesicle,” “preparate” instead of “specimen”) does not impede comprehension.
127	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “macroslides were taken from the preparate” and describes tissue dimensions, which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “preparate” is non-standard and the actual term “radical prostatectomy” is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly confirmed.	: Partially  	: The report states that “three suspicious area were found” and gives measurements, but it never explicitly confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Suspicious areas alone do not equate to a verified malignant diagnosis, so malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: Although fields for “Primary Gleason class”, “Secondary Gleason class”, and “Gleason score” are listed, they are all left blank. No numerical values or valid inferences are provided, so the Gleason score cannot be determined.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several grammatical issues: “preparate” should be “preparation” or “specimen”; “Most of finding” should be “Most of the findings”; “some finding was found” is awkward; “so to seminal vesicles” should be “as do the seminal vesicles”. These errors are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
128	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate gland tissue in shavings,” which clearly identifies the specimen as transurethral resection (TURP/TUR-B) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states “samples show histological signs of adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “3+4=7,” providing both major (3) and minor (4) patterns and the sum (7).  	: Appropriate  	: The language is generally clear and understandable. Minor wording issues such as “form prostate gland tissue” (likely meant “from”) and “regionaol” (regional) do not impede comprehension.
129	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate gland tissue” and describes the macroscopic appearance (“grey-white”, “firm consistency”), which together clearly indicate that the material examined is prostate tissue. Although the exact procedure (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not named, the context is sufficient to determine the sample type.	: Partially  	: The text states there are “suspicious changes with a mixed architecture” and that the Gleason grade “is not determined.” These phrases imply that malignancy cannot be ruled out, yet no definitive diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The Gleason system is explicitly mentioned, but the report concludes that “finding's class is not determined.” No major or minor Gleason patterns, nor any sum score, are provided or can be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable overall, but contains several minor grammatical and spelling issues: “form” should be “from,” “srface” should be “surface,” “regionaol” should be “regional,” and “finding's class” should probably be “findings’ classification.” These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
130	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostate chippings” clearly indicates that the specimen consists of transurethral resection (TURP/TUR-B) chippings, so the sample type can be assessed.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “benign features only,” which definitively indicates the absence of malignancy.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not performed and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; while “chippings” is slightly informal, it is commonly used in pathology reports for TUR specimens.
131	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostate samples” is mentioned, but no specific sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is given, so the exact nature of the specimen remains unclear.  	: No  	: The statement only says “mix features” without specifying whether these mixed features include malignancy or are purely benign. No explicit mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign diagnosis is provided.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are reported or inferable from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“mix features” instead of “mixed features”) and an incomplete line “T=, M=”. These issues are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible.
132	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies” and lists “LEFT” and “RIGHT” cores, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The report states “BENIGN FEATURES ONLY” and describes all cores as benign, so the malignancy status is unambiguously assessed as benign.	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores are provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard histopathology terminology that would be understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons.
133	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate samples” and the later “SUMMARY PROSTATE SAMPLES” confirms that the material examined consists of prostate tissue. No further qualifier (biopsy, TURP, RP) is given, but the sample type is clearly prostate tissue.	: Yes  	: The report states “There is no PIN” and does not mention carcinoma; therefore the findings are explicitly benign. Malignancy status can be assessed as negative.	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and understandable. Minor non-standard capitalization (“SOME MIX CHANGES T= M=”) does not impede comprehension.
134	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “radical prostatectomy” in the summary section, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement indicates that “no residual malignancy could be found” and that only “benign features” are present. This allows a definitive assessment that the findings are benign (i.e., non-malignant).	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable, with only minor non-standard capitalization and formatting (e.g., “T= 77000, 1X010, M = 09450”) that does not impede comprehension.
135	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “prostate sample” and “prostate samples,” which implies that the material examined is prostatic tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The text explicitly states “Unsure of findings” and “Please discuss at MDT.” No clear statement is made about the presence or absence of malignancy; the findings are inconclusive. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major pattern, minor pattern, or sum score) is provided, nor can any be inferred from the text.	: Major mistakes  	: The grammar and wording contain significant issues: “mix inflamatoru residual could be found” is ungrammatical and unclear; “MIX FEATURES” is vague; “T= , , M =” is incomplete. These errors hinder comprehension for both laypersons and professionals.
136	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostate chippings” clearly indicates the specimen is transurethral resection (TUR-P) chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “There is no malignancy,” so the malignant status is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not required; hence it cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; the capitalized summary line is stylistic rather than a grammatical error.
137	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostate samples” is mentioned, but no explicit specification is given as to whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The report states “difficulties in determine the findings” and lists only “acute and chronic inflammation and other mix findings.” No clear statement is made that malignancy is present or absent; the findings are inconclusive. Thus malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor described, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or inferable.	: Major mistakes  	: The text contains grammatical errors (“There is difficulties in determine the findings”) and truncated abbreviations (“T=, M=,”). These issues hinder readability and would likely confuse a lay reader.
138	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies” and describes “cores” from both left and right sides, clearly identifying the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “no invasive malignancy” and summarizes the findings as “benign features only,” allowing a definitive assessment that no malignancy is present.	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not applicable; therefore, major, minor, and sum scores cannot and need not be provided.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and easily understandable. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., the numeric codes at the end) do not impede comprehension.
139	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “fragmented prostate samples” and “prostate samples,” which clearly indicates that the material consists of prostate biopsies. However, it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue, so the sample type is only partially specified.	: No  	: The report lists findings such as “PIN” (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and “other formations,” but it never explicitly states whether invasive adenocarcinoma is present or absent. PIN is a premalignant change, not definitive malignancy, and “other formations” is too vague. Therefore, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Because no invasive carcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. The fields “T=, M=,” are left blank, offering no usable data.	: Minor mistakes  	: The language is understandable, but phrases like “other formations” and “MIX FEATURES” are imprecise. Standard terminology would be “mixed findings” or “mixed histologic features,” and “other formations” should be replaced with a specific description (e.g., “focal atypical glands suspicious for carcinoma”).
140	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” and gives a Gleason score, confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: The report lists “Primary Gleason pattern: 3” and “Secondary Gleason pattern: 3”, and explicitly states “Gleason score: 6”, which directly translates to 3+3=6.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, well-structured, and uses standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., capitalisation, bullet points) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not impede understanding.
141	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “PROSTATE” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (apex/base margins, circumferential margin, seminal-vesicle invasion, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so we can only infer it is most likely a radical prostatectomy.	: No  	: Although the template contains fields for Gleason pattern and score, every value is left blank. The summary line ends with “GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” (empty) and “Nx (UICC TNM 8th edition)”, which does not confirm malignancy. Therefore we cannot determine whether malignant findings were present.	: No  	: The Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and overall score) are all empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains several spelling/grammar issues (“determin”, “RPOSTATE”, missing punctuation). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they should be corrected for clarity.
142	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	0	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostate chippings” clearly indicates that the specimen is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P/TURP) specimen, commonly referred to as “chippings” or “chips.”  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “No invasive disease,” which confirms that no invasive carcinoma was found. The presence of PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is noted, but PIN is not invasive malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy status is assessable as negative for invasive cancer.  	: No  	: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required. Consequently, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable, using standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., capitalization of “SUMMARY”) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
143	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and “blocks,” which implies that the material is histological tissue, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be partially assessed.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Cannot decide on type of invasive disease,” which means malignancy (adenocarcinoma) has neither been confirmed nor ruled out. Only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is reported, and PIN is not invasive carcinoma. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Because no invasive adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. The text therefore offers no basis for determining major, minor, or sum Gleason scores.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The spelling “sampes” should be “samples,” and the phrase “Cannot decide on type of invasive disease” is slightly awkward; “Cannot determine the presence or type of invasive carcinoma” would be clearer. Overall the meaning is understandable, but these minor issues slightly detract from perfect clarity.
144	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The report states “no invasive malignancy” on both sides and only mentions PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is not invasive cancer. Therefore, the findings are benign (no malignant adenocarcinoma).  	: No  	: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable; minor shorthand (e.g., “T=77100, M=09450”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
145	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and “6 prostate samples,” which clearly indicates that the material consists of prostate biopsies. However, it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or another type of specimen, so the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The text mentions “PIN” (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and “other mix formations,” but PIN is a pre-malignant change, not overt malignancy. There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignant diagnosis. Therefore, the malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis (adenocarcinoma) is given, Gleason grading is not relevant. Consequently, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) can be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains grammatical issues: “An estimated (fragmented) prostate samples” should be “An estimated fragmented prostate sample” or similar; “It is no possible” should be “It is not possible.” These are minor mistakes that do not prevent comprehension.
146	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, clearly indicating the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The report states “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” and provides a Gleason score, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is 3, secondary is 4, and the Gleason score is given as 7, so the format 3+4=7 is directly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is well-structured, uses standard terminology, and is understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons.
147	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and lists radical-prostatectomy-specific landmarks (apex margin, base margin, circumferential margin, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, etc.), so it is almost certainly a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “prostatectomy” itself is never stated, so the sample type is only implicitly rather than explicitly given.	: No  	: Although the report repeatedly refers to “tumour”, it never actually confirms that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present. All fields that should contain the diagnosis (Tumour type, Description, Findings) are left blank or say “unable to decide on changes, grade group”. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from the text.	: No  	: Every Gleason-related field (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary patterns and Gleason score) is empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several spelling/grammar slips (“determin”, “dicid”, missing articles, inconsistent punctuation). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, yet a lay reader might be confused by phrases such as “unable to dicid on changes”.
148	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostate chippings,” which is a standard histopathology term for transurethral resection (TURP) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “No malignancy seen” and concludes with “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). This unambiguously indicates benign findings with no evidence of malignancy.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise, grammatically correct, and understandable to both clinicians and lay readers.
149	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and “blocks,” which implies that tissue has been received and processed, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The description lists “glandular and stromal hyperplasia and other changes,” which are benign findings. There is no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is clear and understandable, although the line “T=, M=” is incomplete and cryptic; however, this does not render the statement incomprehensible.
150	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies” and lists left- and right-sided cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Partially  	: The left side is reported as benign. The right side contains ASAP and PIN, which are not unequivocally malignant; ASAP is suspicious but falls short of carcinoma. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully confirmed or ruled out.	: No  	: No Gleason grading is provided, nor can it be inferred, because no definite adenocarcinoma is diagnosed.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is clear, concise, and uses standard terminology (ASAP, PIN) that is understandable to clinicians and informed patients.
151	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” from both left and right sides, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The plural “samples” suggests multiple fragments, most consistent with needle biopsies, yet this is only inferred, not declared.	: Partially  	: A cluster of atypical glands is described, but the report explicitly says it is “unable to determine whether malignancy” and considers the possibility of ASAP adjacent to PIN. Therefore malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out; the statement is inconclusive.	: No  	: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason grade is assigned or implied. Consequently, major + minor = sum cannot be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable but contains grammatical lapses (“to considered as an area…”) and odd abbreviations (“T=, M=”). A lay reader would grasp the gist, yet the phrasing could be smoother (e.g., “considered to be an area of atypical small acinar proliferation”).
152	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	0	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly lists “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally states “prostatic adenocarcinoma” and provides all relevant malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern breakdown is given as “Primary Gleason pattern: 4” and “Secondary Gleason pattern: 3”, and the summary explicitly states “GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3)”. Thus the major+minor=sum format (4+3=7) is directly inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard medical report language and are readily understandable to clinicians or informed lay readers.
153	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which implies the material is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively determined.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Tumour type: Unable to recognise” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES – UNABLE TO DEFINE DUE TO THE SAMPLE CANTAMINATION.” Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded, the malignancy status is unassessable.  	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” or left blank, and the tumour type itself is declared unrecognisable. Consequently, no Gleason pattern or score can be extracted.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but it contains spelling errors (“cantamination” should be “contamination”) and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing spaces after colons). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
154	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	0	0	: Yes  	: The term “chippings” is standard pathology jargon for trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) chips, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “Only benign features seen” and repeats “BENIGN FEATURES ONLY” in the summary, so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable. The only minor spelling issue is “imflammation” instead of “inflammation,” which does not impede comprehension.
155	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	0	1	: No  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” generically, but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical-prostatectomy specimen. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined.  	: No  	: The statement lists “chronic inflammation” and “suspicious findings,” but explicitly says the samples are “contaminated and cannot be examined further.” No malignant diagnosis (e.g., adenocarcinoma) is confirmed, nor is benign status unequivocally stated. Thus malignancy status is unassessable.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable overall, but contains spelling errors (“imflammation,” “examned”) and awkward phrasing (“some mix findings”). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
156	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “prostate biopsies” (cores from left and right sides), so the type of specimen is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: Malignancy is explicitly reported: two cores on the right show infiltrating acinar adenocarcinoma, while the left-sided cores are benign. Thus, the presence/absence of malignancy is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3), satisfying the requirement for major + minor = sum.	: Appropriate  	: The text is clear, concise, and uses standard terminology understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “RIGHT SIDED ADENOCARCINOMA”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
157	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes “LEFT” from “RIGHT,” which implies that the material comes from a prostate biopsy set. However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: Partially  	: The RIGHT side is described as having “mix findings which is not clear (due to samples contaminaton)” and the summary states “SOME FINDINGS … MORE EXAMINATION IS NEEDED.” These phrases indicate that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the findings are inconclusive. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided or can be inferred from the text. The statement explicitly calls for “MORE EXAMINATION,” so no grading information is available.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable overall, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “mix findings which is not clear,” “samples contaminaton,” and “T=, M=” without explanation. These do not render the text incomprehensible, but a lay reader might find the phrasing awkward.
158	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The statement clearly states the presence of “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” and confirms malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is explicitly given as “Primary Gleason pattern: 4” and “Secondary Gleason pattern: 4,” with the summary stating “GLEASON SCORE 8 (4+4).” Thus, the major + minor = sum format (4+4=8) is directly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard for a pathology report and should be understandable to a layman with minimal medical background.
159	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which implies the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the exact sample type is only partially discernible.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “No evidence of malignancy” in the anterior fat and repeatedly uses placeholders (“-”) or “not decided” for tumour type and Gleason elements. The summary further states the prostate samples are “UNCLEAR AND MIX FINDING” and need re-examination. Consequently, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be definitively assessed from this report.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and overall score) are marked “-” or “not decided.” No numerical values or patterns are provided, so the Gleason score in the required format cannot be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are understandable and typical for a pathology report. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., “Samples need to be study again”) do not impede comprehension.
160	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which clearly indicates that the specimen is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P/TURP) specimen, commonly referred to as “chips.”  	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally reports the presence of prostatic adenocarcinoma, stating that approximately 27 % of the chips contain carcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 3 + 4 = 7, and it is repeated in the summary line. No inference is needed.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard histopathology terminology. A lay reader might need explanation of “chippings” and “Gleason,” but the statement itself is grammatically correct and easily understood by professionals.
161	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and “blocks,” which implies a tissue specimen (likely biopsy cores), but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The statement only says “some findinga” (misspelled) and “MIX FINDING, FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED.” It neither confirms malignancy nor confirms benign findings; it explicitly defers any conclusion.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy itself is not established, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains spelling errors (“findinga” instead of “findings”) and awkward phrasing (“MIX FINDING”). A clearer layman-friendly version would be: “All tissue blocks have been examined. About 27 % of the 67 prostate samples show abnormalities; further evaluation is required.”
162	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly identifying the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The report states that one core on the left side is “infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding. The right-sided cores are described as benign, but the presence of malignancy on the left is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as “Gleason score 6 (3+3)” and Grade Group 1, providing the major pattern (3), minor pattern (3), and sum (6).	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians and informed laypersons. Minor abbreviations (PIN, T=77100, M=81403) are domain-appropriate and do not impede comprehension.
163	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes between “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, but it never explicitly states whether these samples come from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.	: Partially  	: The left side is described as having “suspicious changes” and possible perineural invasion, but the wording “suspicious” and “might be” stops short of confirming malignancy. The right side is explicitly benign with PIN (high-grade PIN is not invasive carcinoma). Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The summary explicitly states “UNABLE TO DECIDE MAXIMUM GLEASON SCORE AND GRADE GROUP”, so no Gleason pattern (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but the phrase “LEFT … infiltrated by some suspicious changes” is awkward; “infiltrated by” should be “show” or “contain”. “RIGHT sided PIN” should be “RIGHT-sided PIN”. These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension.
164	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary section, so the sample type is clearly identified as a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Yes  	: The presence of “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” is explicitly stated, along with extensive malignant features (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, positive margins). Therefore, malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 4, the secondary as 5, and the tertiary pattern (3) is explicitly excluded from grading. The Gleason score is stated as 9. Thus, the Gleason information is complete and directly inferable as 4 + 5 = 9.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard for a pathology report and are readily understandable to a layman with minimal medical background.
165	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “SEPARATE LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE FRAGMENT”, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Tumour type: Unclear” and “Need further examination”. Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out, the malignancy status is not assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern numbers or scores are provided; all relevant fields are left blank. Thus the Gleason score cannot be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable despite some non-standard punctuation and capitalization. A lay reader could grasp that the findings are inconclusive and further work-up is needed.
166	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which are standard terms for transurethral resection (TURP) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “approximately 8 of 104 chips contain Gleason 4+3=7 prostatic adenocarcinoma” and the summary line confirms “ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4 + 3) GRADE GROUP 3.” Thus malignancy is unequivocally reported.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “4+3=7” in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum scores are fully available.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; minor stylistic choices such as “chippings” instead of “chips” are acceptable in pathology reports. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
167	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	0	1	: No  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” but never specifies whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. No operative procedure or specimen type is given.  	: No  	: The statement only says “suspicious changes” and “UNCLEAR FINDINGS.” It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; therefore the malignant status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is not established, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable but slightly awkward (“approximately 8 samples contain some suspicious changes” could be clearer as “approximately 8 of the samples show suspicious changes”). The summary line “T=, M=” is cryptic and should be expanded or omitted.
168	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The report states that multiple cores on both sides are “infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding.  	: Yes  	: The summary line gives the Gleason score directly as “7 (3+4),” which translates to major pattern 3 + minor pattern 4 = sum 7.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard histopathology terminology understandable to clinicians and informed laypersons.
169	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	0	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “prostate samples” on both sides, implying needle-biopsy cores, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (e.g., “biopsy”, “TURP”, or “radical prostatectomy”). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.	: No  	: The findings are described as “mix findings which is unclear”, “sample contamination”, and “suspicious changes”. No definitive statement of malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or benignity is provided; the summary explicitly says “UNCLEAR”. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (pattern 3, 4, 5, etc.) or any combination thereof are mentioned. Without a confirmed carcinoma, Gleason scoring is not applicable.	: Major mistakes  	: The text contains multiple grammatical errors (“The findings has”, “Thefindinga re”, “ength”, missing spaces, inconsistent punctuation) and awkward phrasing that hinders readability. A lay reader would struggle to understand the message; significant proof-reading is needed.
170	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” and lists the Gleason score, confirming a malignant finding.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is 3, the secondary is 5, and the sum is explicitly given as 8 (3+5=8).	: Appropriate  	: The language is standard medical terminology and is understandable to clinicians; lay readers might need some terms explained, but the grammar and clarity are appropriate for the domain.
171	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which clearly indicates that the material examined is prostatic tissue. Although the exact source (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not specified, the context is unambiguous.	: Partially  	: The report states that the tumour type is “UNCLEAR” and that findings are “UNCLEAR AND SUSPICIOUS.” While malignancy is not confirmed, the use of the word “suspicious” implies that malignancy cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the malignancy status is not definitively assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and Gleason score) are marked with dashes (“-”), indicating that no Gleason information is provided or can be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard for a pathology report. While lay readers may need clarification on some terms (e.g., “UICC TNM 8th edition”), the overall language is appropriate for the intended medical audience.
172	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “chippings” (i.e. transurethral resection chips, TUR-P) and mentions that 7 blocks were examined, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “approximately 23 of 57 chips contain … prostatic adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “5 + 5 = 10” and is repeated in the summary line, so the major, minor and sum scores are fully available.	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; minor colloquial use of “chippings” instead of “chips” is acceptable in pathology reports.
173	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	0	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostate samples” is mentioned, but it is not specified whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined with certainty.  	: No  	: The report only states “suspicious changes” and “SUSPIOUCE CHANGES” (likely a misspelling of “suspicious”). No definitive statement of malignancy (e.g., “adenocarcinoma present”) is given, nor is benign status confirmed. Hence malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable overall, but “SUSPIOUCE” is a clear misspelling of “suspicious,” and the line “T=, M=” is cryptic without explanation. Minor grammatical or typographical issues are present but do not render the statement incomprehensible.
174	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly identifying the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The report states that multiple cores on both sides are “infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are provided for each side (left: 4+3=7, right: 4+4=8) and the summary explicitly gives the maximum Gleason score as 8 (4+4).	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard histopathological terminology that would be understandable to clinicians and informed lay readers.
175	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATE” and lists radical-prostatectomy-specific anatomic sites (apex, base, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, circumferential margin), so it is clearly a prostate specimen. However, it never explicitly states whether the specimen is a radical prostatectomy, TURP, or biopsy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.	: No  	: The report repeatedly uses phrases such as “some suspicious changes,” “unclear to classify,” and “unclear for classifying.” No definitive statement is made that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present. Without an explicit diagnosis of malignancy, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and overall Gleason score) are left blank. Because no numerical values are provided, the Gleason score in the required format cannot be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several grammatical issues: “a small suspicious changes” should be “small suspicious changes” or “a small suspicious change”; “some suspicious changes is observed” should be “some suspicious changes are observed”; and “unclear for classifying” should be “unclear how to classify” or “difficult to classify.” These are minor mistakes that do not render the text incomprehensible.
176	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	0	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY” in the summary, clearly identifying the specimen type.  	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally reports malignant findings: “adenocarcinoma” in the anterior fat and “prostatic adenocarcinoma” in the prostate.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 8 (5+3) in the summary, satisfying the requirement for major, minor and sum scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is well-structured, uses standard terminology, and is readily understandable to both clinicians and informed lay readers.
177	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLE”, which implies the specimen is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether it comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.	: No  	: The statement repeatedly uses phrases such as “some suspicious changes”, “unclear to classify”, and “unclear for classifying”. These expressions indicate that the pathologist could not confirm malignancy. Because the presence of cancer is neither asserted nor denied, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Gleason score) are left blank. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason pattern or score could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The grammar is understandable but contains several minor errors: “suspicious changes” should be “suspicious change” (singular), “is observed” should be “are observed”, “suspious” is misspelled, and “unclear for classifying” should be “unclear to classify”. These issues do not render the text incomprehensible, but they slightly reduce clarity.
178	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which are standard terms for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens. Therefore, the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “approximately 17 of 257 … chips contain Gleason 4+5=9 prostatic adenocarcinoma” and the summary line reads “ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5) GRADE GROUP 5.” These phrases unambiguously indicate the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is explicitly given as “4+5=9,” satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is clear and concise. Minor domain-specific shorthand (e.g., “chippings,” “T=77100, M=81403”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not impede understanding.
179	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.	: No  	: The statement only refers to “suspicious changes” and explicitly says they are “unable to categorise.” No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is supplied or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but “SOMESUSPICIOUS” should be two words (“SOME SUSPICIOUS”) and “T=, M=” is cryptic without explanation.

Thus, malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given as “primary Gleason pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5,” yielding a Gleason score of 4+5=9. This is explicitly restated in the summary line “MAXIMUM GLEASON SCORE 9 (4+5).”	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians and informed lay readers.
181	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	93	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes between “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The statement describes “suspicious changes” and mentions infiltration, perineural and extraprostatic extension, yet it explicitly says the changes are “unclear” and avoids confirming malignancy. Without a clear declaration of cancer, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can any be inferred from the vague description of “suspicious changes”.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains grammatical slips (“bee” instead of “be”, inconsistent punctuation, and abrupt fragments like “2. RIGHT .”). These are minor and do not impede overall comprehension, yet they could be polished for clarity.
182	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATE” as one of the examined sites and the summary line states “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY”, so the sample type is clearly a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Yes  	: The report states “Tumour type: Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” and the summary confirms “PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA”. Therefore malignancy is unequivocally present.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7. From this the format 4+3=7 can be directly inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, standard medical terminology is used, and the structure is logical. There are no grammatical errors that would hinder understanding by a lay reader.
183	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement repeatedly mentions “PROSTATE” and lists regional lymph-node groups (obturator, external/internal iliac) that are typically harvested during a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection. This clearly indicates the sample type is a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Partially  	: The prostate section is described only as having “some suspicious changes” and “unclear Gleason pattern or not.” While this implies the possibility of malignancy, it does not explicitly confirm adenocarcinoma. The lymph nodes are all negative, but the prostate itself remains inconclusive.	: No  	: Although fields for primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason patterns and the overall Gleason score are listed, none of them are filled in. Therefore the Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be determined from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor typographical issues such as “SUSPCIOUS” instead of “suspicious,” inconsistent spacing, and incomplete data fields. These do not render the statement incomprehensible, but they slightly reduce clarity.
184	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	95	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which clearly indicates the specimen is transurethral resection (TURP) chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement reports “adenocarcinoma” and gives the Gleason score, so malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly provided as “3+5=8,” satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is concise and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (“chippings”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
185	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	95	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The phrase “samples have been entirely examined in blocks” hints at a biopsy set, yet this is not stated explicitly.	: No  	: The report only states “suspicious changes” and “need further examination.” It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which they could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “10%of” should be “10 % of,” and the empty “T=, M=” line is superfluous.
186	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	0	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is prostate needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The statement repeatedly states that the cores are “infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The summary line gives “MAXIMUM GLEASON SCORE 10 (5+5),” from which the major pattern (5), minor pattern (5), and sum (10) are directly provided.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians and informed laypersons.
187	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, which implies that the material is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The report repeatedly uses the phrases “suspicious changes which is unclear” and “suspicious findings”. These expressions indicate that malignancy has not been confirmed; the findings are equivocal and require further study. Hence the malignant status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading has been provided, nor can it be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores in the format major+minor=sum cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several grammatical issues: “changes which is unclear” should be “changes that are unclear”; “some prostate samples infiltrated by some suspicious findings” is awkward; “T=, M=” is incomplete. These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they could be improved for clarity.
188	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATE” and “RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY”, clearly indicating that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy sample.  	: Yes  	: The report states “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” in the prostate and documents metastatic deposits in lymph nodes, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The primary and secondary Gleason patterns are both given as 5, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 10, so the format 5+5=10 is directly available.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is well-structured, uses standard terminology, and is readily understandable to both professionals and informed lay readers.
189	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	0	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATE” as one of the six examined specimen groups, indicating that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (prostate with regional lymph-node dissection).  	: Partially  	: While the lymph-node sections describe “suspicious findings” and “some changes,” the prostate section itself is left almost entirely blank (no tumour type, Gleason score, or invasion status filled in). The summary merely states “SOME SUSPICIUS CHANGES, UNABLE TO DETERMINE.” Thus malignancy cannot be fully confirmed or excluded for the prostate tissue itself.  	: No  	: The Gleason fields (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary pattern and Gleason score) are all empty; no numerical or descriptive data are provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite the spelling error “SUSPICIUS” instead of “suspicious.” The structure and terminology are otherwise clear to a lay reader.
190	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	0	0	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples taken from chippings near the urothelial cells,” which strongly suggests TUR-P (transurethral resection) chippings, but it never explicitly states the specimen type. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: Yes  	: The pathologists explicitly confirm “moderate-high grade adenocarcinoma” and provide a revised Grade Group 3, so malignancy is clearly established.  	: Yes  	: The report gives the revised Gleason pattern as 4 (most common) + 3 (secondary) with tertiary 5. The standard convention is to record the two most prevalent patterns, so the inferred Gleason score is 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3). This is sufficient to extract the required major + minor = sum format.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains a few minor issues: “diffentiation” should be “differentiation,” “chippings” is informal (standard term is “chips”), and “burn artefacts” is more commonly written “burn artifacts.” These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
191	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	0	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samples totalling 10 g” and refers to “post-BPH treatment consultation,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen. However, the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “suspicious of GLEASON pattern” and describes malignant-appearing components occupying ~40 % of the area, confirming that malignancy is present.	: Partially  	: The major component is described as ~40 % and the minor component as ~10 %, which allows an inferred Gleason pattern of 4 + 3 = 7. However, the actual Gleason grades (e.g., pattern 4 vs. pattern 3) are not explicitly given, so the assessment is only partial.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing such as “suspicious of GLEASON pattern” (should be “suspicious for Gleason pattern”) and “totalling around 10% of the area” (better as “comprising approximately 10 % of the area”). These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension.
192	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly mentions “höyläyslastuja” (TURP chips) and gives the weight (≈30 g) and block distribution, so the sample type is unequivocally transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that only benign prostatic tissue is seen, with no atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma, confirming a benign finding.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor stylistic choices such as “missä ei … näy” are acceptable in pathology reports.
193	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that “prostatakudosta” (prostate tissue) is identified, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further specification.  	: No  	: The report explicitly says that “päättelyä … maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä” (no conclusion about malignancy or carcinoma can be drawn). Thus, malignancy status remains undetermined rather than confirmed benign or malignant.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report; it uses standard medical phrasing understandable to clinicians.
194	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa” (12 representative needle biopsies), which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies from standard prostate sites.  	: Yes  	: The phrase “lähinnä benignin oloista kasvua” (“mainly growth that appears benign”) explicitly indicates that no malignant findings were detected; the examination verified benign findings.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores can be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to a layman, with only minor stylistic choices typical of Finnish pathology reports.
195	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista” (prostate tissue from agreed locations), which implies biopsies, but the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states that the final conclusion is still pending (“Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken”). Therefore, no information is given about whether malignant or benign findings were identified.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy status is not provided, no Gleason grading can be inferred or stated.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear, concise, and uses standard medical phrasing understandable to a lay reader.
196	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomianäyte” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The summary states that only mild inflammation and age-related changes are present, with no mention of carcinoma or any malignant findings. Therefore, the absence of malignancy is clearly communicated.	: Not applicable  	: Because no prostate adenocarcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores are not assessable.	: Appropriate  	: The text is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard Finnish medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “tutkimuskäyttöön saatu autopsianäyte”) are acceptable within the pathology domain and do not hinder comprehension.
197	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that the sample is derived from an autopsy specimen (“ruumiinavauksesta”), but it does not explicitly state the type of prostate specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that no conclusions can be drawn beyond atrophy and inflammation, and that additional studies are needed to evaluate possible adenocarcinoma or other malignancies. Hence, malignancy cannot be assessed from the current findings.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “lisätutkimuskia” should be “lisätutkimuksia”) are domain-typical and do not impede comprehension.
198	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Näytteenä on yhteensä 12.3 g lastuja” clearly indicates that the specimen consists of tissue chips weighing 12.3 g, which is typical for a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate).  	: Yes  	: The sentence “Mitään maligniin suoraan viittaavaa ei näy” explicitly states that nothing directly indicative of malignancy is seen, so the findings are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant tissue is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, although the word “lastuja” is colloquial for “chips” and “käynnistetään ne yhdellä kasetilla” is slightly non-standard laboratory phrasing; nevertheless, the intended meaning is clear.
199	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatamateriaalia” (prostate material) and “ajetaan yhdellä kerralla” (run in one batch), which implies a TURP-like resection specimen, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy).  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that inflammatory changes are seen but “polttoartefaktat estävät näytemateriaalin luotettavan tarkastelun” (cauterisation artefacts prevent reliable evaluation) and “mitään konklusiivista johtopäätöstä ei voida vetää” (no conclusive conclusion can be drawn). Therefore, malignancy status cannot be determined.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant finding is reported or can be inferred, Gleason grading is not relevant.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and understandable; the terminology is standard for pathology reports.
200	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsiat” (prostate biopsies) and refers to “biopsiasylinterit” (biopsy cores), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies from the prostate.  	: Yes  	: The report states that no carcinoma or PIN changes are found (“ei löydetä karsinoomaa tai PIN-muutoksia”) and describes only benign prostate tissue. Therefore, malignancy status is explicitly assessed as negative.  	: No  	: Since no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report and would be clear to a lay reader with basic familiarity.
201	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “useita näyttöönottokohtia” (several biopsy sites) taken from “standardilokaatioista” (standard locations), which clearly points to needle-biopsy material. However, the exact specimen type (e.g. “transrectal core biopsies”) is not explicitly named, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that no atypical structures were observed and that the material is insufficient to reliably assess the presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. Therefore malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the findings are inconclusive rather than benign.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Consequently, the Gleason score in the requested format is not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although slightly formal. A layman might need clarification on terms like “PIN-kaltaiset muutokset,” but overall the language is appropriate for its intended medical audience.
202	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The text states that “kasvainkudosta” (tumour tissue) is found in macro-blocks A and B, confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are provided for both tumour-containing blocks:  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for pathology reports.
203	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “laajentuneesta prostatasta” (an enlarged prostate) and describes processing of left- and right-side sections, apex and base samples, and indexing from A to H. These details strongly suggest a radical prostatectomy specimen, but the exact sample type is never stated explicitly, hence only a partial assessment.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that a larger and smaller Gleason grade “ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään” (cannot be reliably determined). It also mentions that a “suurempi summa” (higher sum) is only suspected and will be referred to a colleague for further studies. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed from this report.	: No  	: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no reliable Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or can be inferred. The text only indicates that scores cannot be reliably assigned.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and vocabulary are understandable to a lay reader, despite some domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “soluarkkitehtuureja”, “perineuraalista invaasiotakaan”). No major errors impede comprehension.
204	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “4 g höyläyslastuja” (4 g of resection chips), which clearly identifies the sample as TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) material.  	: No  	: The microscopic description reports “suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa” (relatively normal prostatic tissue) with “polttoartefakta” (thermal artefact) and “rauhaset melko tuhoutuneet” (glands largely destroyed). The only pathological suggestion is “hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan” (slight benign prostatic hyperplasia). There is no mention of malignancy; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to professionals and informed laypersons.
205	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostata-käsittelymateriaalia” (prostate processing material) and describes fragmented pieces processed in three separate batches, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, but the exact specimen type remains unclear.	: No  	: The report explicitly states that “tulokset ovat epäselvät” (the results are inconclusive) due to severe thermal artefact and fragmentation. No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; the findings are indeterminate.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prostata-käsittelymateriaalia”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
206	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsiat” (prostate biopsies) taken in the usual manner, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Partially  	: The report describes a suspicious focus with nuclear atypia that “might correspond to adenocarcinoma,” but it is explicitly stated that “no clear adenocarcinoma was found.” Therefore, malignancy is not confirmed; only suspicion is raised.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided or can be inferred from the text, because no definite carcinoma was identified.	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable, using standard Finnish medical terminology. There are no grammatical errors that impede comprehension.
207	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytemateriaalia” (prostate sample material) and that it was collected according to routine instructions, but it never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a more specific source.  	: No  	: The statement describes “atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia” (atypical structures and morphological changes) but immediately concludes that the finding was “häviävän pieni” (vanishingly small) and that “mitään definitiittiä johtopäätöstä … ei voitu tekan” (no definitive conclusion could be drawn). Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which these could be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable to a lay reader. Domain-specific phrasing such as “atyyppisia rakenteita” is acceptable in a pathology report.
208	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaaliprostatomian preparaatin” (radical prostatectomy specimen) in sample 3, so the sample type is clearly identifiable. Samples 1 and 2 are described as lymph-node samples, which are additional but do not contradict the main specimen type.  	: Yes  	: The text states that tumour tissue is found in both lobes of the radical prostatectomy specimen, invading glandular structures. This is a malignant finding. The lymph-node samples are reported to be free of malignancy, but the prostate specimen itself is malignant.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+3=7”, with the minor pattern (3) comprising about 30 %. This is a complete and valid Gleason score presentation.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear, professional Finnish understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader. Medical terminology is used correctly, and the structure is coherent.
209	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “näytteet 1 ja 2” and “näyte 3” but does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). The phrase “normaalin rutiiniprotokollan mukaisesti” hints at routine processing, yet the actual source of the tissue remains unstated.  	: Partially  	: The text explicitly says that samples 1 and 2 are “maligniteeteista vapaita” (free of malignancy). For sample 3, it describes “vaihtelevia kasvupatterneja” and “PIN-muutoksia” but never confirms the presence of invasive adenocarcinoma; instead, it speaks of “epäilykset” (suspicions) and “mahdollisesti kiinnostavia ominaisuuksia.” Thus, malignancy status for sample 3 is left ambiguous.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly states that the highest identifiable Gleason grade is missing: “Korkein tunnistettu Gleason luokka näyttää puuttuvan, sillä taulukossa on merkattuna ? ja ? major ja minor kohtiin.” No numerical values for major, minor, or sum are provided or can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although it uses domain-specific shorthand (e.g., “PIN-muutoksista diskussoitiin”). A layman might need clarification on terms like “PIN” or “Gleason luokka,” but the overall language is appropriate for a pathology report.
210	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatan elektrosektiolastuja” (electro-resection chips from the prostate), which clearly identifies the sample type as TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Mitään malignia ei tule esiin” (“no malignancy is found”), allowing a definitive assessment that the findings are benign.  	: No  	: Because no malignancy is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is standard medical Finnish, grammatically correct and understandable to a layman with minimal medical vocabulary.
211	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	1	1	: No  	: The text mentions “gram-level” material and “histological examination,” but it never specifies the source (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The statement describes “large amounts of prostate tissue” and “epithelial borders appear normal,” but it explicitly states that “no definite conclusions can be drawn” and “erroneous sample handling is suspected.” No malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or inferable from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “gramman verran näytemateriaalia” is awkward; “ajot tehtiin 8:ssa stepissä” is colloquial; “vaikuttaa normaalilta” should be “vaikuttaa normaalilta” or “vaikuttaa normaalilta” depending on intended nuance). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
212	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita” (8 representative systematic prostate biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: No  	: The conclusion states that the diagnosis is uncertain and leans toward benign (“diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin”). Because no definite malignant finding is given, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is confirmed, Gleason grading is not provided and is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in standard Finnish medical terminology understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader; grammar and clarity are acceptable.
213	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	1	1	: No  	: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) arriving in eight separate batches, but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined.  	: No  	: The text only refers to “normaalia basaalisolukkoa” (normal basal cell tissue) and to “epäilys … epäonnistumisesta” (suspicion of failure) of immunostains. There is no statement confirming or excluding malignancy; the findings are inconclusive.  	: No  	: Because malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains some awkward phrasing (e.g., “mitkä viittaisivat siihen että värjäykset epäonnistuivat”). Replacing “mitkä” with “jotka” and adding commas would improve clarity, yet the overall meaning remains accessible to a lay reader.
214	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states “invasiivista kasvainsolukkoa” (invasive tumour tissue) and “maligni pesäke” (malignant focus), confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “Gleason luokkaa 4+3”, which translates to 4+3=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional but understandable; minor spelling issues (“muodostaaa” → “muodostaa”) do not impede comprehension.
215	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “all parts of the prostate including base, apex and mid-section were examined”, which implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP) is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: Partially  	: The statement describes “prostate tissue forming tubular structures with variable degrees of differentiation”, which is suggestive of adenocarcinoma, but it never explicitly declares “malignant” or “adenocarcinoma present”. The inability to reliably assess Gleason components and the disclaimer about high-grade PIN further weaken the clarity.	: No  	: Although the text mentions “values 4 and 3” as the most common Gleason components in this setting, it immediately states that these values “cannot be reliably assessed” because only ~5 % of the material was examined. Therefore no usable Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is generally understandable, but some phrasing is awkward or non-standard (e.g. “prostatasolukkoa”, “epäluotettavana”). A lay reader would grasp the gist, yet clearer wording such as “prostate tissue” instead of “prostatasolukkoa” and “could not be reliably assessed” instead of “ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan” would improve readability.
216	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostatan elektrosektiolastut” clearly indicates that the sample consists of transurethral resection (TURP) chips from the prostate.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states that the histological examination shows “pääasiassa säännöllistä prostatakudosta” and concludes “löydös siis benigni,” confirming benign findings and ruling out malignancy.  	: Not applicable  	: Since the diagnosis is benign, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and understandable. Minor stylistic note: “on käynnistetty kahdeksassa blokissa” would be more idiomatic as “on käsitelty kahdeksassa blokissa,” but the intended meaning is still evident.
217	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the sample “koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta” (consists of suspected prostate-cancer tissue) and that it has been “käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa” (started in eight parts). This implies the material is a multi-part specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether it is biopsy cores, TURP chips, or a radical-prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.  	: No  	: The text only says the tissue is “epäilty eturauhassyöpäsolukko” (suspected prostate-cancer tissue) and that “korkearesoluutioiset kuvat ovat toistaiseksi odottamassa digipatologian jonossa” (high-resolution images are still waiting in the digital pathology queue). No definitive malignant diagnosis is given, nor is benign status confirmed. Hence, malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement.  	: No  	: Because no malignant diagnosis has been rendered, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; the only slightly technical phrase “digipatologian jonossa” is acceptable in a pathology report context.
218	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita” (prostate core-needle biopsies), clearly identifying the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Näytteestä B havaitaan karsinoomaa” (adenocarcinoma is found in sample B), confirming a malignant finding.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+5=9”, satisfying the requirement for major, minor and sum scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for pathology reports and would be clear to a lay reader with minimal domain knowledge.
219	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	1	1	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions that samples were taken from “typical locations of the prostate” and compares the amount of material from the right versus the left side. This clearly indicates that the specimen type is prostate tissue obtained by biopsy (multiple cores from both lobes).  	: Partially  	: The statement describes “some abnormalities” in sample B that are suspicious enough to warrant consultation with a colleague. However, it stops short of confirming malignancy; it only labels the pattern as “suspect” and states that confirmation is still pending. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully assessed from the text alone.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major pattern, minor pattern, or sum) are provided, nor is there any numerical or descriptive information from which these could be inferred. The only mention is of “abnormal differentiation patterns” without further detail.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable and mostly appropriate, but it contains a few non-standard or awkward phrases (e.g., “hitusen verran enemmän”, “tasoisia erilaistumispatterneja”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a more formal wording would improve clarity.
220	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostatektomia-preparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard cassette-by-cassette handling, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The statement reports “kasvainta” (tumor) and “tuumori” (tumor) in the peripheral zone and explicitly labels the findings as “Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa” (Gleason 7-level carcinoma), confirming malignancy.	: Partially  	: A Gleason score of 7 is given, and the pattern distribution is described (“isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%”), implying a likely 3 + 4 = 7. However, the exact minor pattern (4) is not explicitly stated, so the full major+minor=sum format cannot be asserted with complete certainty.	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “scoorauksella”) is domain-typical and does not impede comprehension.
221	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that the material is “ajettu kaseteilla” (processed into cassettes) and refers to “kattava katsaus potilaan prostatakudokseen”, which implies a systematic sampling typical of either a radical prostatectomy or a large TURP. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: Although “erikoisia kasvurakenteita” (peculiar growth patterns) are noted, the report explicitly says that a final evaluation is postponed until the uro-meeting next week and that further sampling is needed to rule out “keski-graduksen GG löydökset” (intermediate-grade Grade Group findings). Therefore, malignancy is not confirmed in this statement.	: No  	: The only Gleason information is an anecdotal comparison to another patient who “oli saanut Gleason 7 luokituksen”. No actual Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is given for the current case, nor can it be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology. While a layman might not grasp every detail, the grammar and style are appropriate for a histopathology report.
222	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostatan höylälastuja” (prostatic chippings), which is the Finnish term for TURP (transurethral resection) chips. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The statement says “lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa” (adenocarcinoma is seen in almost all [chips]), so malignancy is unequivocally present.  	: Yes  	: The text gives “Gleason 4:ää … pistesumma 8”. Interpreting this as Gleason pattern 4+4=8 is the only clinically reasonable reading, so the major, minor and sum scores can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is colloquial but fully understandable to a lay reader; no grammatical errors impede comprehension.
223	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatan kudosmateriaali” (prostate tissue material) and that “kaikki materiaali on prosessoitu,” which implies a tissue sample was examined, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: Partially  	: The statement explicitly says that “edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa” (a representative Gleason or other marker cannot be confirmed at this point). It also mentions “epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta” (suspicion of adenocarcinoma) but stresses this is not based on histopathology. Thus, malignancy status is explicitly undetermined and cannot be assessed from the current findings.	: No  	: The text states that no representative Gleason score can be confirmed at this stage; any mention of Gleason 8 / ISUP GG 4 is explicitly noted as not based on histopathology. Therefore, no valid Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The language is generally understandable, but there are minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “skooppitutkimuksessa näytemateriaalin läpi vahvistetaan että kliiniset symptomit voivat hyvin perustua histopatologiaan” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but polishing would improve clarity.
224	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “kolme fuusiobiopsiaa” (three fusion biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text describes “karsinoomafokuksia” (carcinoma foci) and gives their lengths, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The Gleason architectural patterns are described (grade 3 and grade 4) and their relative proportions are given (≈2/3 pattern 3 and ≈1/3 pattern 4). From this one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not stated in the canonical “major+minor=sum” format, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “score 7 yhteensä”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
225	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa” and “kudosta”, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue”, not the exact specimen type.  	: Partially  	: The statement clearly indicates that malignant-appearing (suspect) foci are present and that varying differentiation grades were observed. However, it simultaneously declares that an exact score cannot be assigned because of resolution problems in the digitised images. Thus malignancy is strongly suggested but not formally confirmed with a grade.  	: No  	: Although the text explicitly refers to possible intermediate grades such as “3+4” or “4+3”, it states that assigning a precise Gleason score is impossible due to the digitisation artefact. Consequently, no definite major + minor = sum triplet can be extracted.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable to a layman, but it contains several spelling/grammatical errors (e.g. “mahdoonta”, “Näisä”, “minkään keski-graden … erilaistuminen voisi olla erittäin vaikeaa arvioida”). These do not impede comprehension but should be corrected for clarity.
226	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatetomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard slicing and colour-coding protocol used for such specimens, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “useampi selkeä fokus” (several clear foci) of tumour are seen, with a predominant Gleason grade 4 and some grade 3. It also notes extensive perineural invasion and capsular penetration. These are unequivocal malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The predominant pattern is given as grade 4 and the secondary pattern as grade 3. From this we can infer the standard Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is slightly technical and uses abbreviations (“s.e.” for “sitä että”), but it is well-structured and understandable to a layman with basic familiarity of pathology reports.
227	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate” and describes multiple tissue blocks (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O) taken from base to apex, which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the actual word “radical prostatectomy” (or “biopsies”, “TURP”) is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly assessed.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that the differentiation grades (Gleason 3–5) may or may not be present and that the material may be “completely normal”. No malignant diagnosis is given; the final evaluation is deferred to a later session. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from this text.	: No  	: Although Gleason grades 3–5 are mentioned as a possible range, no actual tumour is identified and no specific Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided. The assessment is postponed, so the score cannot be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains non-standard or awkward phrasing (“todnäk”, “täyskropan kuvantamisella”, “seminaalivehikkelien”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but would benefit from minor corrections (e.g. “todennäköisesti”, “koko leikkeen kuvantaminen”, “seminaarikalvojen”).
228	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja” (chips from TURP), so the sample type is clearly transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  	: Yes  	: The text states that “pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa” (carcinoma is seen in a small part) and later refers to “neoplastiseksi tulkittavassa osuudessa” (the part interpreted as neoplastic), confirming malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason sum of 7 is given, and the major pattern is stated to be 3 (≈60 % of the tumor). However, the minor pattern is not explicitly stated, so the exact format “major+minor=sum” cannot be fully reconstructed.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “pienessä osassa”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish.
229	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the material is obtained “in connection with standard prostate procedures” and is processed in twelve tissue parts, but it never explicitly states whether the specimens are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy slices. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue obtained during a standard procedure,” but not specified precisely.	: Partially  	: The report explicitly raises the possibility of ISUP GG 1 (Gleason Grade Group 1) or higher in a small focus (5 %), yet simultaneously states that the focus is too small for reliable grading. Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status remains equivocal rather than clearly assessable.	: No  	: Although the text mentions “ISUP GG 1 or higher,” no actual Gleason pattern scores (major + minor = sum) are provided, and the focus is explicitly deemed too small for reliable grading. Thus, no complete Gleason score can be extracted.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable; any lay reader with basic medical vocabulary can grasp the message. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prosessoidaan kahdessatoista kudos-osassa”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish.
230	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat” (targeted prostate biopsies) taken from typical locations, which clearly identifies the sample type as biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The statement reports adenocarcinoma in sample 4, confirming a malignant finding. Samples 2 and 3 are described as benign, and sample 1 is non-representative, but the presence of malignancy in at least one sample is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is provided for sample 4: “isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)”. From this, the major pattern is 3 (90%) and the minor pattern is 4 (10%), yielding a sum of 7. Thus, the Gleason score can be inferred as 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, though it uses some domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “epäedustava”, “rauhasten yhteensulautumista”) that is acceptable in clinical reports.
231	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatan kudosnäytteitä” (prostate tissue samples) and describes routine handling, but it never explicitly states the clinical context (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a more specific label.  	: Partially  	: The report explicitly labels samples 2 and 3 as benign. Sample 4 is described as having “soluarkkitehtuureja, jotka poikkeavat normaalista … mahdollisesti malignia,” but the pathologist explicitly questions whether the tissue is even prostate and states that further checks are needed. Thus malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the finding is inconclusive.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains a few non-standard or awkward phrases (“rajatapauksen verran vähästä riittävään määrää”, “labrafibaa”). These do not prevent comprehension but could be polished for clarity.
232	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiaresekaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly stated.  	: Yes  	: The text states that adenocarcinoma is found in sections from both the apex and the base, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: Gleason grades are given for both foci: apex 3+4 and base 4+4, from which the sums (7 and 8, respectively) can be directly inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional but understandable; any layman unfamiliar with medical terms may need clarification, yet the grammar and terminology are correct and standard for the domain.
233	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “eturauhaskudoksen näytteet” (prostate tissue samples) and describes their division into six main sets from apex to base, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that “mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta” (assessment of a possible adenocarcinoma is impossible) due to tissue alterations from prior treatments. Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign finding can be extracted.	: No  	: Although the text hypothetically mentions “matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4)”, it immediately underlines that such a finding is purely hypothetical and cannot be confirmed. Consequently, no actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable, using domain-appropriate terminology. While the sentence structure is complex, it remains coherent for a lay reader with some medical background.
234	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Prostatalastuja” (prostate chips) clearly indicates that the specimen consists of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips, so the sample type can be assessed.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly describes “kasvainkudosta” (tumor tissue) with malignant cytological features (enlarged, variable nuclei with prominent nucleoli) and assigns a Gleason grade, confirming malignancy.	: Partially  	: The statement reports “eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4,” which corresponds to Gleason 5+4. However, the sum (9) is not explicitly stated, so the complete major+minor=sum format is only partially assessable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua”) is acceptable within the histopathology domain and does not hinder comprehension.
235	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “ekstraktoitu eturauhasmateriaali” (extracted prostate material) and refers to “useampi fragmentti 3/5 g” (multiple fragments 3/5 g each), which implies a fragmented specimen, most consistent with trans-urethral resection (TURP) chips or possibly biopsy cores. However, the exact sample type is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: The statement describes stromal tissue and “mattomainen kasvu” (cribriform growth pattern), which can raise suspicion of malignancy, but it explicitly states that nuclei have faded and technical background noise prevents assessment of cellular differentiation. Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign finding can be extracted from the text.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or can be inferred.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable to a professional reader, but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “voidaaan” should be “voidaan”, “lisää QC:ta” is informal). A layperson might struggle with domain-specific terms like “mattomainen kasvu” and “QC”, but overall the message is comprehensible.
236	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä” (prostate core-needle biopsies) from both sides, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The report states that the left-side fragments contain “matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa” (poorly differentiated carcinoma tissue) and “syöpäkasvustoa” (cancer growth), confirming malignancy. The right-side fragments are explicitly described as non-malignant.  	: Partially  	: The Gleason pattern is given as “kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4”, which translates to a dominant pattern 3 and secondary pattern 4. However, no explicit sum (Gleason score 3+4=7) is stated, so the score can be inferred but is not fully spelled out.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable to a layman with minimal medical terminology. No major grammatical errors are present; only the phrase “kasvutapaa 3” could be slightly clearer as “Gleason-asteikolla pääasiassa kuvio 3 ja toiseksi eniten kuvio 4”.
237	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä” (a jar of prostate tissue samples) and refers to left- and right-sided fragments, so we know the material is prostate tissue. However, it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The statement describes chronic inflammation, fragmentation, and a wide spectrum of cellular differentiation, but it does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy. Instead, it questions the origin and integrity of the tissue and concludes that the samples are unsuitable for classification. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: Although the term “Gleason-luokan määrittäminen” (determining the Gleason grade) is mentioned, the text explicitly states that such grading is “poikkeuksellisen vaikeaa” (exceptionally difficult) and that the fragmented, variable samples are unsuitable for classification. No actual Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, even if slightly technical. A layman might need clarification on terms like “Gleason-luokan” or “fragmentoitumista,” but overall the language is appropriate for a pathology report.
238	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiapreparaastista” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the processing of macro- and microscopic sections, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “adenokarsinoomamuutosta” (adenocarcinoma) is present, extending from mid-zone to base, confirming a malignant finding.	: Yes  	: The percentages given for the patterns (60 % grade 4, 30 % grade 5, minimal grade 3) allow the Gleason score to be inferred as 4 + 5 = 9, which is explicitly confirmed in the summary: “Gleason-pistesumma on 9”.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard spelling (“prostatektomiapreparaastista”), and the medical terminology is used correctly for a histopathology report.
239	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “valmistellusta näytesetistä” (a prepared sample set) and refers to macro-sections and microscopic examination, which implies a biopsy or TURP-like specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the information is only partial.	: Partially  	: The text refers to a previous report that mentioned “Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä” (Gleason grade 3 findings), indicating malignant findings. However, the current statement itself does not confirm malignancy; it only refers back to an earlier, incomplete report. Thus the malignancy status is only partially assessable from this statement alone.	: No  	: While the earlier report is said to have mentioned “Gleason luokan 3”, no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum score is provided in this statement, nor can such a breakdown be reliably inferred. Therefore the Gleason score in the required format cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish used is professional and understandable, although slightly technical. There are no major grammatical errors or ambiguities that would hinder comprehension by a lay reader.
240	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “turp-lastuja” (TURP chips) and gives an approximate weight (~10 g), so the sample type is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “Gleason 4 -luokan tuumorikasvua” is present in 50 % of the chips and concludes with “pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi,” confirming malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The phrase “pistesumman 8 adenokarsinoomaksi” directly gives the Gleason sum (8). Since only Gleason pattern 4 is mentioned, the score can be inferred as 4+4=8.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable to a layman, with only minor domain-specific phrasing (“yhteensulaneina asinuksina”). No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
241	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the material consists of “biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä” (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TUR-P specimens), so the possible sample types are listed. However, it does not specify which exact type each individual case represents, only that the pool contains all three.  	: Partially  	: The text explicitly states that the original diagnosis was benign (“benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen”). It then describes that in about 25 % of these originally benign cases the review raised the grade to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, i.e. to low-grade carcinoma. Thus, malignancy status can be inferred for those re-graded cases, but it is not stated for every single specimen.  	: Partially  	: Gleason scores (3+3 and 3+4) are given for the subset that was re-graded. However, no individual major/minor/sum triplet is provided for each case, only the two possible patterns mentioned. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be extracted for every specimen.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard or awkward phrasing (e.g. “potilaita, joiden biopsioita… oli saatavilla”, “havainnoillistamaan”, “harjoittelujoiden”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a smoother wording would improve clarity.
242	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as three separate tissue cores (“kudoslieriötä”), i.e. needle biopsies, and gives their lengths. No further specification is required to determine the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that prostate adenocarcinoma is present in samples (1) and (2) and that no atypical tissue is seen in sample (3). Therefore malignancy can be assessed.  	: Partially  	: The text gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 4 and 3 in the cancerous portions (sample 1: 20 % G4 + 30 % G3; sample 2: 15 % G4 + 35 % G3). From these percentages one can infer that the dominant pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, yielding a Gleason score 3+4=7 in both cores. However, the exact major/minor pattern assignment is not stated outright, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; any layman with basic medical literacy would grasp the findings. Minor stylistic choices (e.g. “vajaa 35 %”) are acceptable in the domain.
243	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions three separate samples (1, 2, 3) and describes their microscopic contents, but it never explicitly states what type of material these samples represent (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: The conclusion explicitly states that “prostatan adenokarsinooma-löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota” (a prostate adenocarcinoma finding cannot be reliably confirmed or ruled out). Hence malignancy status remains undetermined.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy could not be confirmed, no Gleason grading was assigned. The text mentions that in sample (1) “suurin piirtein kaikki pystyttiin arvioimaan Gleason erilaistumispatterniensa suhteen”, but immediately adds that “näkemyseroista johtuen tämä tapaus arvioidaan seuraavassa uro-miitissä” (due to differing opinions the case will be re-evaluated in the next uro-meeting). Thus no usable Gleason score is provided.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although it uses some domain-specific phrasing (e.g. “uro-miitissä”, “PIN-muutoksia”). A layman might need clarification on technical terms, but overall the statement is clearly expressed.
244	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text describes “laaja kasvain” (extensive tumour) and provides details about tumour extent and margins, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The dominant Gleason grade is given as 3, with “almost as much” grade 4 differentiation, but no explicit minor pattern or summed Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7) is stated. One can infer a likely 3+4=7, yet the exact minor grade is not formally declared.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is professional and understandable; minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “käynnistetään normaalilla kaavalla”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
245	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as coming from the prostate (“prostatasta”) and mentions that it is processed according to normal handling procedures. Although the exact specimen type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly named, the description of apex-to-base orientation (A–C toward apex, D–F toward base) is consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can be assessed.	: Partially  	: The text mentions a possible “Gleason summa 7” in the clinic’s notes, but it explicitly states that histological evaluation is “extremely difficult” due to recent radiotherapy and that reliable histopathology cannot be performed. Thus, malignancy cannot be confidently confirmed from the histopathology itself; only a clinical suspicion is reported.	: Partially  	: A Gleason sum of 7 is mentioned, but no primary and secondary pattern numbers are provided, and the text questions whether this corresponds to Grade Group 2 or 3. Because the Gleason score cannot be reliably inferred from the histopathology (due to RT effects), only the clinical note is available, making the assessment partial at best.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology. While lay readers might need clarification on abbreviations like “RT” (radiotherapy), the overall language level is appropriate for a histopathology report.
246	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “höyläyslastuja” (shavings) and the weight “13 g” clearly indicate that the material is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “Karsinoomaa todettiin histologisesti blokeissa F & G” explicitly states that carcinoma (adenocarcinoma) was histologically confirmed in blocks F and G.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “Gleason 3+3=6”, providing major pattern 3, minor pattern 3, and sum 6.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise and uses standard Finnish medical terminology; it is readily understandable to professionals and can be interpreted by informed laypersons.
247	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatasta lähtöin oelvaa kudosmateriaalia” (tissue originating from the prostate) processed in eight batches, which implies a tissue sample, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not clearly assessed.  	: Partially  	: The statement indicates that the growth patterns in most samples “ei noudattanut normaaleja prostatasyövän erilaistumista” (did not follow normal differentiation of prostate cancer) and that Gleason 3 “olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin” (might possibly have been observed to a small extent). This wording is highly tentative and inconclusive; it neither confirms nor rules out malignancy. Hence malignancy status is only partially assessable.  	: No  	: No explicit Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided. The text merely speculates that “Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin,” which is insufficient to derive a valid Gleason pattern or sum.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Finnish contains several spelling/typing errors (“tusinam grammaa”, “oelvaa”, “väitetysti”) and awkward phrasing that obscure meaning. While a layman might grasp the gist, the numerous orthographic and grammatical issues significantly hinder comprehension.
248	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “kuusi biopsialieriötä” (six biopsy cores), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported in three cores (adenocarcinoma with Gleason scores provided), while the remaining cores are described as benign (hyperplastic epithelial changes). Thus malignancy status is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are given for each positive core in the standard major+minor=sum format: 4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology; a lay reader might need clarification on terms like “graduksen 4 osuus,” but the overall level is appropriate for a pathology report.
249	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “kuudesta kiinnostavasta alueesta” (six regions of interest) and refers to them as “tutkimusmateriaali”, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can only infer that it is some form of prostate tissue submitted for histopathology, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement repeatedly uses cautious wording such as “atyyppisiä kasvupatterneja”, “epäselvällä erilaistumisasteilla”, “mahdollisesti esi-maligniteettisia muutoksia”, and “löydöksiä joita tulisi tutkia tarkemmin”. No definitive diagnosis of malignancy (or benignity) is rendered; the material is simply forwarded to a pathologist for further work-up. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and none can be inferred from the vague descriptions of “atypical growth patterns” and “possible premalignant changes”.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but it contains a few grammatical oddities (e.g. “mitkä tutkitaan” should probably be “joita tutkitaan”, “epäselvällä erilaistumisasteilla” should be “epäselvillä erilaistumisasteilla”, “ylipäätänsä” is non-standard and should be “yleisesti” or “kaiken kaikkiaan”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
250	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly indicates that the specimen is a “prostata” (prostate) obtained “tuorenäytteenä” (as a fresh sample) and weighing ≈40 g. The description of systematic sectioning into apex-to-base blocks (A–F) is typical of a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that “vasemman lohkon kaseteista A ja C havaitaan invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa” (invasive adenocarcinoma is found in left-sided blocks A and C) with extraprostatic extension and perineural invasion. Thus, malignancy is clearly confirmed.	: Yes  	: The text mentions “eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3” (mostly grade 4 differentiation, lesser grade 3) and concludes with “Pistesumman 7 löydös” (Gleason score 7 finding). This directly translates to Gleason 4 + 3 = 7.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is standard medical language, easily understood by professionals and reasonably clear to an informed layperson. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
251	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “tuore prostatakudos materiaali” (fresh prostate tissue material) and describes how six separate specimens (A–F) were taken from defined anatomical sites. This strongly implies that the material is prostate biopsies, but the word “biopsies” itself is never used, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that the tissue in specimens A and C was “ei ollut prostatasta” (was not prostate tissue) and that capsular penetration, perineural invasion, or tumour differentiation could not be evaluated. No mention of carcinoma or any malignant finding is made; instead, it states that the intended evaluation could not be performed. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The summary sentence “Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista” (determination of the score sum was not possible) directly indicates that no Gleason score could be assigned.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but it contains a few spelling/grammar issues (e.g., “siiten” → “siten”, “kotheena” → “kohteena”, “erityiseti” → “erityisesti”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
252	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly mentions “lastuista” (chips), which in Finnish histopathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. Therefore the sample type is identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present, upgrading the diagnosis from “epävarma” (uncertain) to “keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi” (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma).	: Yes  	: The grades are given directly: “erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5.” This translates to a Gleason pattern 4 (major) + 3 (minor) = 7, with tertiary 5, corresponding to Grade Group 3.	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional Finnish with only minor colloquialisms (“todelle” instead of “todella”). It is understandable to clinicians and, with minimal effort, to informed laypersons.
253	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	1	1	: No  	: The statement does not mention the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). It only refers to “kudosnäyte” (tissue sample) without further specification, so the sample type cannot be determined.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that the previous uncertain diagnosis could not be resolved and that malignancy could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. Therefore, the malignancy status remains undetermined.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy was not confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices such as “MM & MM” for the consultants’ initials are acceptable in clinical notes.
254	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “systeemibiopsiossa” (systematic biopsies) and later “targetoitua biopsiaa” (targeted biopsies), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.  	: Yes  	: The text describes malignant findings in both rounds: first a minimal focus of Gleason 3+3=6, and later a large focus with pattern 4 and “vaikuttaa vahvasti kuitenkin että toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5” (strongly suggests pattern 5). Thus malignancy is confirmed.  	: Partially  	: The first biopsy gives a clear Gleason score (3+3=6). For the second biopsy the pathologist only describes “pääosin kasvutapaa 4” and “vaikuttaa vahvasti … kasvutapa 5”, without explicitly stating a combined score. We can infer a likely Gleason 4+5=9 or 5+4=9, but the exact major+minor=sum is not explicitly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians. Minor colloquialisms (“potilas kuitenkin oireillut”, “vaikuttaa vahvasti kuitenkin”) are acceptable in clinical narrative and do not impede comprehension.
255	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “näytteet” (samples) were taken after imaging, which implies a biopsy procedure, but it never explicitly states the sample type (e.g., needle biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: No  	: The statement repeatedly uses vague phrases such as “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä” (suspicious findings) and “kudoksen tulkinta vaikeaa” (tissue interpretation difficult). It explicitly avoids confirming malignancy, instead stating that interpretation is inconclusive and additional sampling is required. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum scores) is provided, nor is there any basis for inferring such scores from the text.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable to a layperson. Domain-specific shorthand (e.g., “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä”) is acceptable in clinical notes.
256	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen, and it also refers to separately submitted lymph-node packets (samples 1 and 2) and seminal-vesicle samples (samples 3 and 4). Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The report confirms that the original prostate contained multifocal adenocarcinoma (“multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta”) and gives Gleason patterns for that tumour. The additional lymph-node and seminal-vesicle samples are explicitly stated to be benign (“puhtaat”, “normaalia solukkoa”, “löydökset benignejä”). Thus malignancy status is assessable.  	: Partially  	: Gleason patterns (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3) are provided for the primary tumour, but no single summed score is given for any focus, nor is it stated which pattern is dominant. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be inferred unambiguously.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology. A layperson might need clarification for some terms (e.g., “basiksestä” = “from the base”), but overall the statement is comprehensible and grammatically correct.
257	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “näytteet eri erissä” (samples in different batches) and gives lengths, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The mention of “alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta” (original prostate tissue) and “imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit” (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) suggests a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only inferred, not directly stated.  	: No  	: The text only says “tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen” (results vary from sample to sample) and that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are “puhtaat” (clean). There is no explicit statement that malignant findings were present or absent in the prostate tissue itself.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which they could be reliably inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although it is written in a concise clinical style that may require some lay interpretation.
258	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti”, i.e. a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that tumour has penetrated the capsule (“tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia”) and gives Gleason patterns (3+4/4+3), confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: Gleason patterns are provided as “3+4/4+3”, indicating two foci with Gleason 3+4=7 and 4+3=7. However, no single summed score is given for the entire tumour, so the exact major+minor=sum for the whole specimen cannot be unambiguously inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional medical Finnish, grammatically correct and understandable to a clinician or informed lay reader.
259	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “collected samples were processed according to normal protocol” and refers to “macro-sections processed from lymph nodes” and “seminal vesicles,” which implies the material is most likely a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä” explicitly states that no malignant findings were present in the seminal vesicles. Although the report elsewhere mentions “abnormal findings in lymph-node macro-sections,” it does not contradict the absence of malignancy in the prostate/seminal-vesicle tissue. Therefore, malignancy status can be assessed as negative.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant findings are reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the level of language is suitable for a pathology report.
260	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly mentions “7.5 g resekaattia” (resectate) and that 7 g of it was processed into six tissue cassettes. This identifies the specimen as a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “ei mitään malignia” and “ei viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan,” confirming that no malignant findings were present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor non-standard orthography (“resekaattia” instead of “resektaattia”) is acceptable in clinical notes.
261	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the specimen was processed into six tissue cassettes, which implies a tissue sample (likely TURP or biopsy), but the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  	: No  	": The statement describes cribriform growth, which is suspicious for prostate adenocarcinoma, but it explicitly denies malignancy (""löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen [syöpään]""). Thus, malignancy cannot be confirmed.  "	: No  	: Since malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	": The Finnish is understandable, but the phrase ""löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen"" is incomplete (missing ""syöpään"" or similar). Additionally, ""histologiseseti"" should be ""histologisesti."""
262	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “Näytteenä 1-6 on edustavat biopsiat…”, which clearly identifies the sample type as representative biopsies from both lobes.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Ei merkkejä karsinoomasta” (no signs of carcinoma) and mentions only high-grade PIN and benign hyperplasia. Therefore, the absence of malignancy is clearly stated.  	: No  	: Since no carcinoma is found, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology that would be clear to a lay reader with minimal domain knowledge.
263	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta” (from the left and right lobes), which implies that the material comes from at least two separately labelled biopsy sites. However, it does not explicitly state the overall sample type (e.g. needle biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The findings describe “pieniä korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia” (small high-grade PIN lesions) and “hyperplasiaa” (hyperplasia). High-grade PIN is a premalignant change, not invasive carcinoma, and hyperplasia is benign. No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or other malignancy is present, so malignancy cannot be assessed as confirmed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no invasive carcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear, concise and uses standard medical terminology. A lay reader might need explanation of “PIN-muutoksia” and “hyperplasia”, but the statement itself is grammatically correct and understandable.
264	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	1	0	: Partially  	: The text mentions the preparation of “8 macro-cassettes and 5 ordinary cassettes,” which implies a surgical specimen rather than needle biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (TURP, simple prostatectomy, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Maligniteettia … ei löydy” (“no malignancy is found”), so we can confidently conclude that the findings are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, it is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “mikroskooppistesti” instead of “mikroskooppisesti”) are acceptable in routine pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
265	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that 8 macro-cassettes and 5 ordinary cassettes were prepared, which implies a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The microscopic description explicitly says “ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan” (“could not be reliably assessed”), so no definitive benign or malignant status is given.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report.
266	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “elektrosektiolastuja” (electro-resection chips), which is a standard way of referring to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) material. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: No  	: The histological description only mentions hyperplastic changes (“hyperplasia”) and mild inflammation. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any other malignant finding, so malignancy cannot be assessed as present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and uses standard histopathological terminology. It is understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons, with only minor domain-specific phrasing that does not hinder comprehension.
267	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that “less than half of the possible specimen material” was processed, which implies a biopsy or TURP-type specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the information is only partial.	: No  	: The histological description only notes “prostate tissue with partly nodular glandular components” and “slight inflammation.” There is no mention of carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, PIN, or any malignant finding. The report explicitly says that a more detailed examination will be done next week, so malignancy status is not assessed in this statement.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “histologisessa tarkastelussa” and “vähäistä inflammaatiota.” Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Alle puolet mahdollisesta näytemateriaalista valmisteltuna”) are acceptable in a pathology context and do not impede comprehension.
268	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “neulabiopsioita” (needle biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Ei epäiltyä maligniteettia” (no suspected malignancy), which directly conveys that no malignant findings were detected.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is standard medical terminology and easily understandable; no grammatical or comprehension issues are present.
269	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “edustavia kudosnäytteitä” (representative tissue samples) and gives their total length in millimetres, which implies a biopsy set. However, it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The histological findings are described as “hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota” (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant process, so malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and concise, using standard medical terminology. A layman might need explanation of “hyperplastista” and “inflammaatiota,” but the grammar and level of understanding are appropriate for a pathology report.
270	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and gives its weight, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “kasvain” (tumour) with three foci is found, confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The report states “Gleason 3 (major) että 4 erilaistumisasteella … siten Gleason grade 7”, which translates to Gleason 3+4=7.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g. “käynnistetty normaalin rutiinin mukaisesti”). A layman can grasp the essential information.
271	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that “a sample” is being examined and that “the remaining tissue is processed according to normal protocol,” but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly writes that “no clarity was obtained as to whether benign hyperplasia or something malignant is present.” This means malignancy status remains undetermined; hence malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The report states that “Gleason score could not be determined,” so no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is available.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report, even though it is concise and slightly informal (“ei selvyyttä”). No major linguistic errors are present.
272	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Höyläysmateriaali” (literally “shavings material”) is the standard Finnish term for tissue obtained by TUR-P (transurethral resection of prostate). Thus the sample type is clearly identifiable as TURP chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states that no atypia or invasive epithelium is seen and the summary reads “Hyvänlaatuinen eturauhashyperplasia” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore malignancy is ruled out.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and uses standard histopathological terminology. While “Höyläysmateriaali” may sound colloquial to lay ears, it is the accepted clinical term in Finland. No grammatical errors impede understanding.
273	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “8.9 g materiaalista” and “8 kasetillista”, which implies a TURP-type specimen (transurethral resection), but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The statement only reports “hyperplasia” and “inflammaatiota” (inflammation) and explicitly says “mahdollisesti jotain muutakin” and “vaatii jatkotutkimuksia”. No malignant diagnosis is given, so malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the sentence structure is slightly fragmented (e.g., “......” and “mutta mahdollisesti jotain muutakin”). Minor polishing would improve clarity for a lay reader.
274	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	1	0	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions “systemaattisia biopsioita” (systematic biopsies) taken from both right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes	: The text states “Eturauhassyöpää ei ilmene materiaalista” (prostate cancer is not present in the material), which directly indicates that no malignant findings were identified.	: Not applicable	: Since no prostate adenocarcinoma was found, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and easily understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report and would be clear to a lay reader with minimal medical context.
275	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that samples were taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate, which implies a biopsy setting, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (e.g., biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy).  	: No  	": The statement explicitly says it is difficult to determine whether there are cancer-related changes (""Vaikea sanoa, onko näytteessä syöpään liittyviä muutoksia""). This indicates inconclusiveness, not a definitive benign or malignant finding.  "	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	": The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, though slightly informal (""vähän kroonista inflammaatiota""). It conveys the uncertainty clearly to a layman."
276	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	1	0	: Yes  	: The term “Prostatektomiapreparaattia” clearly indicates a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions malignant findings: “Gleason 4 asteen erilaistumista” and “Pieni määrä Gleason 3,” confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The statement gives the Gleason pattern as 4+3=7, which is the required format (major+minor=sum).  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and domain-appropriate; a layman might need clarification on “Gleason 4 asteen erilaistumista,” but overall it is understandable.
277	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	1	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostatanäyte” clearly indicates that the specimen is from the prostate, but it does not specify whether it is a biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or another type of sample. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that it cannot be determined whether the findings represent cancer or inflammation. Consequently, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “8?” for weight) are acceptable in clinical shorthand.
278	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	43	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “about 30 g of prostate chips” (prostatalastuja), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that “nothing suggestive of prostatic adenocarcinoma is found,” thereby confirming benign findings.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores are not assessable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and grammatically correct for a pathology report; lay readers might need explanation of “prostatalastuja” and “atrofiouituneita,” but the statement is otherwise easily understood.

This indicates that malignancy status cannot be assessed from the findings.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason grading is not applicable in this context.	: Appropriate  	": The grammar and phrasing are clear and understandable, though slightly informal (""purkkiin""). It conveys the intended message effectively without major issues."
280	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsiota” (prostate biopsies) and refers to “aiemmissa biopsioissa” (previous biopsies), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta” (no tumour tissue is seen at all) and “ei mitään epäilyttävää” (nothing suspicious). Thus, the findings are benign.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant tissue is identified in the current sample, Gleason grading is not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report and should be clear to a lay reader with minimal medical knowledge.
281	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “edustavia prostatanäytteitä” (representative prostate samples) and refers to “aiemmissa biopsioissa” (previous biopsies), clearly indicating that the material examined consists of prostate biopsies.  	: No  	: The report states that no malignant changes can be concluded (“Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään”). Therefore, the current examination does not confirm malignancy; it only notes benign findings with chronic inflammation and focal atrophy.  	: No  	: Since no malignant findings are reported in the current examination, no Gleason score is provided or inferable. The mention of prostate cancer in previous biopsies does not supply the required Gleason information for the current samples.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to professionals and laypersons alike.
282	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “kokonainen prostatektomiapreparaatti” (a complete prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text describes a “yhtenevä kasvainkudoksen fokus” (a cohesive focus of tumour tissue) and assigns a Gleason pattern (3+4), confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The statement gives the Gleason pattern as “luokat 3+4”, which is interpreted as Gleason score 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is professional and concise; while it uses domain-specific abbreviations (E, F, G, O, P) and slightly condensed phrasing, it remains understandable to a trained reader and is acceptable for a pathology report.
283	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäyte” (prostate sample) and that it was processed routinely, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as a prostate specimen, but not the exact type.  	: No  	: The findings are described as “epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen” (unclear and difficult to interpret), and no definitive statement of malignancy or benignity is provided. The mention of “negatiiviset marginaalit” (negative margins) and “ei metastaaseja” (no metastases) does not confirm malignancy, as these could also apply to benign conditions. Thus, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since no definitive diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given, no Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., “kudosfokuksen” could be clearer as “kudosfokus”). The term “seminalvesikkelit” is correctly used, but overall, the language is slightly technical for a layman.
284	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaali” (chips from transurethral resection of the prostate, i.e. TURP), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista” (no prostate cancer is found) and describes only benign findings (regular prostatic tissue with basal-cell hyperplasia). Thus malignancy status is unambiguously assessed as negative.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to a lay reader.
285	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “eturauhasmateriaali” (prostate material) and that it was placed in cassettes and partly sectioned, which implies a biopsy or resection specimen, but the exact type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states “ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei” (it could not be determined whether cancer-related changes are present). Thus, malignancy status remains unconfirmed.  	: No  	: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard medical terminology. No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
286	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “kolme biopsiapalaa oikealta ja kolme palaa vasemmalta” (three biopsy cores from the right and three from the left), so the sample type is clearly identified as prostate biopsies.	: Yes  	: The text states “Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella” (no malignant findings on either side), which directly conveys that no malignancy was detected.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Tutkitaan” instead of “Tutkitussa näytteessä”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish and do not hinder comprehension.
287	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “eturauhasmateriaalia” (prostate material) from right and left sides and gives a total length of “30 + 40 = 70 mm”, which is consistent with needle-biopsy cores. However, the exact sample type (biopsy vs TURP vs prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: The text explicitly says “Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla” (“It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right”). Therefore malignancy status is unassessable from the statement.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score is provided or inferable; the question is therefore not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear, grammatically correct, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons.
288	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostataresekaatti” (prostate resection specimen) and describes the slicing routine (apex, mid-section, basis, seminal vesicles), which clearly identifies the sample type as a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “histologisesti löydetään adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma is found histologically) and lists malignant features such as capsular invasion and perineural growth. Therefore, malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.  	: Partially  	: The report gives the most common and second-most common Gleason patterns for each focus (first focus: 4 and 3; second focus: 5 and 4). However, it does not explicitly state the combined Gleason score (major + minor = sum) for each separate focus. Instead, it provides a summary “Gleason 9 kasvain,” which can be inferred as the highest overall score, but the individual focus scores are not fully specified in the required format.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable, using standard Finnish histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “ensin löydetyssä kasvainfokuksessa”) are acceptable within the domain and do not hinder comprehension.
289	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the material comes from “useasta ruukiinavauksesta” (several autopsies) and that the prostate tissue has been processed in a routine fashion (apex, mid-gland, base, seminal vesicles). This clearly indicates autopsy-derived prostate tissue, but it does not specify whether the material is biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that “ei kyetä erittelemään erilaistumismuutoksia yksilöille” (differentiation changes cannot be assigned to individuals) and that findings are “esimerkinomaisia” (illustrative examples). No individual patient-level malignant diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The summary explicitly says that, because the material is for demonstration purposes, “näitä ei käytetä määrittämään erilaistumisasteita (esim. Gleason 1–5)”. Thus, no Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are given or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable for a histopathologist or a lay reader. Domain-specific abbreviations and phrasing (e.g., “esimerkinomaisia histologisia muutoksia”) are acceptable in this context.
290	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “eturauhasen höyläyslastuista” clearly identifies the material as TURP (transurethral resection) chips from the prostate.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that carcinoma (“karsinooma”) was found in five chips, confirming a malignant finding.  	: Partially  	: The report gives the most common Gleason grade as 3 and the next most common as 4, which allows one to infer a likely Gleason score of 3+4=7 (or 4+3=7). However, it does not explicitly state the major and minor patterns or the summed score, so the information is only partially complete.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard medical terminology. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
291	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteistä” (prostate samples) and “lasilla” (slides), which implies the material is histological sections from prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.  	: No  	: The text only says that “joitakin muutoksia” (some changes) were seen and that “jatkotutkimuksia” (further investigations) are needed. It explicitly states that “arviointi ei ole mahdollista” (evaluation is not possible) due to technical limitations. Thus, no information is given about whether the findings are malignant or benign.  	: No  	: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although slightly informal (“juuri nyt”). It is suitable for a layman or non-specialist reader.
292	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “neulabiopsioita” (needle biopsies) and lists individual biopsies (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported in the right-sided biopsies (Gleason 3+4 and 3+3), while the left-sided biopsies are explicitly described as benign. Thus malignancy status is assessable.	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are given directly as 3+4=7 and 3+3=6, satisfying the required format.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable to a layman, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “lasissa 1A” (should probably be “laseissa 1A”), “noni” (likely intended “noin”), and slightly awkward phrasing like “3+4 rakenteesta noni 60 % Gleason 3”. These do not impede comprehension but could be polished.
293	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “laseilla” (slides) and gives dimensions in millimetres, which strongly implies that the material is histological sections from needle biopsies (right and left sets). However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsy vs. TURP vs. RP) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: The report explicitly says “Löydökset ei määritettävissä” (“findings not determinable”). Although it mentions “erilaistunutta kudosta” (differentiated tissue) in one core, it neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; the overall conclusion is inconclusive.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the inconclusive statement prevents any inference of a Gleason grade.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “laseilla 1A” should probably be “lasilla 1A”, “löydettiin” is missing an auxiliary verb). A lay reader would still grasp the gist, but a polished report would tidy the phrasing.
294	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “radikaali prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the type of material is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “Adenokarsinoomaa molemmissa lohkoissa” (adenocarcinoma in both lobes), confirming malignant findings.	: Partially  	: The report gives the dominant Gleason grade as 4 and the next most common as 5, with grade 5 comprising about 10 % of the tumour surface. This allows us to infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9 (or 5+4=9 if the pattern distribution were reversed), but the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not spelled out in the standard “X+Y=Z” format, hence only partial assessment is possible.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in professional Finnish with standard medical terminology. While a layperson might need some terms explained (e.g., “neoadjuvanttihoidot”), the grammar and clarity are appropriate for a pathology report.
295	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “kasetteihin” (into cassettes) and describes microscopic findings in “lohkoissa” (blocks), which implies a tissue sample, but it never explicitly states whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Thus the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: Yes  	: The description “invasoi ja muodostaa erillisiä, vaihtelevia muodostelmia rauhaskanavista” clearly indicates invasive carcinoma. Although the phrase “muutosten luonne määrittelemätön” introduces some uncertainty, the overall wording confirms malignancy.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided or can be reliably inferred from the text. The statement only describes architectural patterns (“vaihtelevia muodostelmia”) without assigning numerical grades.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable to a lay reader, but some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., “joitakin löydöksiä muutamissa eri lokaatioissa”). Replacing “lokaatioissa” with “kohdissa” and clarifying “muutosten luonne määrittelemätön” would improve clarity.
296	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	1	0	: Yes	: The statement clearly indicates that the sample consists of “lastuja prostatahöyläyksestä” (chips from a prostate resection), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The weight and cassette handling are also mentioned, confirming the sample type.	: Yes	: The text explicitly mentions “Gleason 3 että 4 erilaistumista,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma. Although the word “adenocarcinoma” is not used, the mention of Gleason patterns 3 and 4 is sufficient to establish malignancy.	: Partially	: The statement tells us that both Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4 are present and that pattern 4 is “a little more common,” but it does not give explicit major + minor = sum values (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7). Therefore, a precise Gleason score cannot be extracted, only inferred qualitatively.	: Appropriate	: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor domain-specific phrasing (“lastuja prostatahöyläyksestä,” “kiinnityksen jälkeen,” “rauhaskäytävissä”). These are acceptable in a pathology report and do not hinder comprehension.
297	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the samples are “prostat näytteistä” (from prostate samples) and gives the post-fixation length (≈10.5 cm), which is compatible with either needle-biopsy cores or TURP chips. However, the exact sample type (biopsy vs TURP vs radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly writes that “näytteen korruptoitumisen takia luonnetta ei voida määritellä” (because of sample corruption the nature cannot be determined). Although “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä” (suspicious findings) and “kribriform rauhasia” (cribriform glands) are mentioned, the final conclusion is that malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded. Therefore malignancy status is not assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern, major/minor scores, or sum is provided or inferable from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable to a lay reader, but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g. “prostat näytteistä” should be “prostatanäytteistä”; “fiksaation jälkeen” should specify units such as “cm”). These do not impede comprehension but are worth correcting.
298	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “10 biopsiaa” (10 biopsies) and “pieniä kudosfragmentteja” (small tissue fragments), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “viidestä löydetään syöpä” (cancer is found in five biopsies) and describes perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension, confirming malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: Gleason information is provided for two separate foci:  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although the phrase “Gleason 4 erikoistumisella” is slightly non-standard (more typical would be “Gleason 4 erikoistumista”). Overall, the language is appropriate for a pathology report.
299	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “useita näytteitä ja pieniä kudosfragmentteja” (several samples and small tissue fragments), which implies a biopsy-type specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or fragments from a radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.  	: No  	: The statement concludes that the samples are “kontaminoituneet eikä löydöksiä voida eritellä” (contaminated and findings cannot be specified). No information is given about the presence or absence of malignancy; the examination is reported as inconclusive.  	: No  	: Because malignancy status itself cannot be determined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology without grammatical errors.
300	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikaaliprostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) and describes the slicing scheme (parts A–C from apex, D–J from base, N–O seminal vesicles), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “mikroskoopilla nähdään kasvainkudosta” (tumour tissue is seen) and later confirms “Adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma), so malignancy is unequivocally present.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Dominoiva erikoistumisluokka 4, pienempi osa luokkaa 3”, which translates to a dominant pattern 4 and a minor pattern 3. This corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology. No corrections are needed for clarity.
301	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) that have been arranged into macroscopic slices from apex to base and includes seminal vesicles. This corresponds to a radical prostatectomy specimen.	: Partially  	: Suspicious, infiltrative changes are described bilaterally and extracapsular extension is noted on the left. However, the pathologist explicitly states that artefacts make definitive assessment impossible, so malignancy is strongly suggested but not conclusively confirmed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the text states that determining the changes is impossible due to artefacts, so no valid inference of Gleason score can be made.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable to a lay reader; only minor domain-specific terms (“makroleikkeet”, “artifaktojen”) are used, which are acceptable in a pathology report.
302	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “höyläysmateriaali” (TURP chips) and gives the weight, so the sample type is clearly identified as transurethral resection material.  	: Yes  	: The text states “suurin osa on pahanlaatuista erikoistunutta eturauhassyöpää” (the majority is malignant specialized prostate cancer), confirming malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly: “Gleason 5” as the major component and “pieni komponentti Gleason 4:sta” as the minor component, allowing the score to be inferred as 5+4=9.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable; the only minor non-standard feature is the use of “Gleason 5” and “Gleason 4:sta” instead of “Gleason pattern 5” and “Gleason pattern 4,” which is acceptable in Finnish clinical shorthand.
303	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that “the entire sample material is 5.7” (grams) and that 4 g are taken into 8 cassettes, which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The report describes “some suspicious changes” and atrophic glands with mild inflammation, but explicitly states that malignancy cannot be determined at this stage and further studies are required. Therefore, the presence or absence of malignancy is not assessable from the text.	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided, and the text explicitly indicates that further investigations are needed, so no Gleason score can be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable. While the phrase “Koko näytemateriaali on 5.7” could be more precise (e.g., “Koko näytemateriaalin paino on 5,7 g”), the intended meaning is clear and the language is suitable for a lay reader.
304	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly identifies the samples as “systeemibiopsiat” (systematic biopsies) taken from both the right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly stated.	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are explicitly reported: “karsinoidi” (carcinoid, i.e., carcinoma) is found in biopsies 1–3 on the left side, while biopsies 4–6 are benign. Thus, malignancy status is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The summary gives the Gleason score directly as “3+3=6” for the left-sided cancer, satisfying the required format.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in standard Finnish medical terminology. While “karsinoidi” is slightly non-standard (the usual term is “karsinooma”), it is understandable in context. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
305	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “eturauhaskudos” (prostate tissue) and describes microscopic findings, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further specification.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says the tissue is “suurimmaksi osaksi benign hyperplastista” (largely benign hyperplastic) and does not report any malignant diagnosis. The focal changes are described as architectural rather than clearly neoplastic, and the final sentence “Ei voida määrittää näytelaadun takia” (cannot be determined due to sample quality) further underlines that malignancy cannot be confirmed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant finding is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a lay reader, but the phrase “Muutoksia kudoksessa löydetty oikeassa apexissa” is slightly awkward; a clearer wording would be “Muutoksia löydettiin kudoksesta oikeassa apexissa”. Overall, however, the meaning is clear.
306	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomiapreparaatti”, which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “Kasvainkudosta löydetään” (tumor tissue is found) in the right apex, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The description gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 3, 4 and 5, but it does not provide explicit major and minor pattern scores or a summed Gleason score. One can infer that the dominant pattern is 3 (70 %) and the secondary pattern is 4 (5–10 %), yielding an inferred score of 3+4=7, yet this is not explicitly stated.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is professional and understandable; only minor stylistic choices such as “suurin piirtein noin” (roughly about) are slightly redundant but do not impede comprehension.
307	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “näytepreparaatti” (sample preparation) and “eturauhaskudosta” (prostate tissue), which implies the specimen is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The findings are described as “benign hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta” (benign hyperplastic prostate tissue) and “kroonista inflammaatiota” (chronic inflammation). There is no mention of malignancy, and the statement does not confirm or deny the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not relevant or inferable from the statement.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, though it uses some domain-specific terminology (e.g., “stroomassa,” “rauhasrakenteet”). It is appropriate for a layman with basic medical context.
308	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	1	0	: Yes  	: The text clearly states “prostatalastuja” (prostate chips), which in routine Finnish histopathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Thus the sample type is identifiable.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “eturauhassyöpää” (prostate cancer) and “kasvainkudosta noin 40 % materiaalista” (tumour tissue about 40 % of the material), confirming a malignant finding.	: Partially  	: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 3 (50 %) and the next most common as Gleason 4 (~20 %). This allows an approximate Gleason score of 3+4=7 to be inferred, but the exact percentages for major and minor patterns are not precisely stated, so the score cannot be taken as formally validated.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, professional Finnish with only minor colloquial phrasing (“nähdään leikkeissä”). It is readily understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons; no significant grammatical errors are present.
309	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “eturauhasnäytteitä” (prostate samples) and describes how the material was processed (“kolmelle kasetille”), so the sample type (biopsies) is clearly identifiable.  	: No  	: The report states “Ei voida määrittää löydöksiä” (“findings cannot be determined”). Therefore, it neither confirms malignancy nor verifies benign status; the examination is inconclusive.  	: No  	: Because malignancy is not established, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and understandable for a layman; minor non-standard phrasing (“Grammaa eturauhasnäytteitä”) is acceptable in routine pathology reports.
310	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “edustavia biopsioita” (representative biopsies) from the right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The text states that in the left lobe “nähdään pieni fokus, jossa syöpää” (a small focus is seen with cancer) and later confirms “karsinooman kokonaispituus on 10 mm”, so malignancy is unequivocally present.	: Partially  	: A Gleason score is given as “Gleason 3 erikoistumisasteella”, which is interpreted as Gleason grade 3. However, only the major pattern (3) is provided; no minor pattern or sum is stated, so the full Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be reconstructed.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Gleason 3 erikoistumisasteella” instead of “Gleason grade 3”) are acceptable in clinical reports.
311	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “näytteet 1 ja 2 oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta” (samples 1 and 2 from right and left lobes), which implies a bilateral biopsy set. However, it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially inferred.  	: Partially  	: The report describes a “pieni fokus muutoksia” (small focus of changes) with cribriform growth and chronic inflammation, but explicitly says differentiation cannot be assessed (“ei pystytä erottamaan erilaistumista”). While cribriform architecture is suspicious for malignancy, the pathologist stops short of confirming carcinoma. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided, nor can they be reliably inferred from the text. The mention of cribriform growth is insufficient to assign a specific Gleason pattern.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable to a layman, using standard clinical phrasing. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “muutoksen kokonaispituus on 10 mm” instead of “muutoksen pituus on 10 mm”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
312	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiaoperoitu preparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and gives its dimensions and weight, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that carcinoma is seen in both lobes anteriorly and that the findings represent prostate carcinoma (eturauhaskarsinooma), so malignancy is confirmed.	: Partially  	: The statement provides the dominant Gleason grade (4) and mentions that about 10 % of the tissue is Gleason grade 5. From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9 (or 5+4=9), but the exact major/minor breakdown is not explicitly given, only the predominance of grade 4.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and uses standard medical terminology. A layman might need some terms explained (e.g., “eturauhaskarsinooma”), but the grammar and structure are appropriate for a pathology report.
313	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “tutkimusnäytteet A-B, apex C-E, basis F-H” and lists macro-cassettes A–H plus four ordinary cassettes I–L. This clearly indicates that the material is a radical prostatectomy specimen (standard sampling of apex, base, and mid-gland with bilateral lobes).  	: No  	: The text states “Ei voida määrittää löydöksiä” (“Findings cannot be determined”). No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignancy is present; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since malignancy is not established, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard histopathology terminology. No corrections are needed.
314	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “formaliinifiksatoituja lastuja” (formalin-fixed chips) and gives a total weight of about 15 g. This clearly indicates the sample type is TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “nähdään tuumorikudosta” (tumor tissue is seen) and describes it as poorly differentiated, occupying roughly 35 % of the surface. This confirms the presence of malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The report provides the Gleason pattern distribution: “Lähinnä nähdään Gleason 4 luokkaa, pienempi osa Gleason 5. Pistesummaksi muodostuu siis 9.” From this we can directly infer the score as 4 + 5 = 9.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “kasvan” instead of “kasvain”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
315	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “formaliinifiksatoituja näytteitä” (formalin-fixed samples) and gives a total weight, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  	: Partially  	: The text describes “muutoksia” (changes) that are “huonosti erilaistuneet” (poorly differentiated) and mentions cribriform glands, both of which are highly suggestive of malignancy. However, the wording stops short of an outright diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, and the final sentence casts doubt on the ability to determine the type of tissue change. Thus malignancy is strongly implied but not unequivocally confirmed.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the text. The only grade-related descriptor is “huonosti erilaistuneet,” which is too vague to assign specific Gleason scores.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the phrasing “muutoksia melkein puolessa näytteestä” and “Näytelaatu on kehno” could be clearer. Replacing “näytteestä” with “näytteistä” and rephrasing “Näytelaatu on kehno” as “Näytteiden laatu on heikko” would improve grammatical accuracy without sacrificing domain-specific style.
316	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “edustavia biopsioita” (representative biopsies) taken from the right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The text states that adenocarcinoma is present in at least two foci (right base and left mid), so malignant findings are explicitly confirmed.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “6 (3+3)”, which provides the major pattern 3, minor pattern 3, and sum 6.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for pathology reports and would be clear to a layman with basic medical context.
317	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Näytteet 1-6 oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta,” which clearly indicates that the material consists of six biopsy cores taken from the right and left prostate lobes.  	: Partially  	: The report states that “ei karsinoomaa” (no carcinoma) is seen in the other samples, but it also mentions “pieni fokus muutoksia” and “toinen muutosfokus” whose nature is not specified beyond size. Because the type of these foci is not determined (“ei voida määrittää muutosten tyyppiä”), the overall malignancy status remains inconclusive rather than definitively benign.  	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can it be inferred from the text.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “muutoksia löydetään,” “kroonista inflammaatiota,” and “ei karsinoomaa.” No significant grammatical errors or ambiguities are present.
318	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “PROSTATEKTOMIARAPORTTI” (radical prostatectomy report) and describes macroscopic and microscopic examination of the entire gland, which unambiguously identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text clearly mentions the presence of tumour tissue (“kasvaimen osuus: 10 %”), three tumour foci, and provides Gleason grades, confirming malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  	: Yes  	: The report lists “Yleisin Gleason luokka: 4” (primary pattern 4), “Sekundäärinen Gleason luokka: 4” (secondary pattern 4), and “Gleason summa: 8”, which directly translates to Gleason 4+4=8.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is standard medical terminology used in pathology reports. While it contains domain-specific abbreviations and phrasing (e.g., “semimaalivesikkeli-invaasio”), these are appropriate for the intended professional audience and remain comprehensible to informed lay readers.
319	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “preparaatti” and gives a tissue size (4 × 2 × 1.5 mm), which implies a biopsy rather than TURP or radical prostatectomy, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.	: No  	: While three “epäilyttäviä alueita” (suspicious areas) are noted, no definitive diagnosis of malignancy (or benignity) is provided. The findings are inconclusive.	: Not applicable  	: No Gleason grades or scores are given; the fields for primary, secondary and total Gleason are left blank.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and the terminology is standard for a pathology report, although lay readers might need clarification on some terms.
320	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatarauhaskudosen lastuina” (prostate gland tissue chips), indicating that the material consists of biopsy fragments with a combined weight of 12 g. This clearly identifies the sample type as prostate biopsies.	: Yes  	: The text states “histologisia tunnusmerkkejä adenokarsinoomasta” (histological features of adenocarcinoma) and later confirms the presence of “keskikokoisen riskin eturauhassyövän” (intermediate-risk prostate cancer). Thus, malignancy is unequivocally reported.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as “3+4=7” and the proportion of pattern 4 is described as “vähemmän kuin 50 %” (less than 50 %), satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons. No significant errors or ambiguities are present.
321	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions that the submitted samples consist of “prostatarauhaskudosta” (prostate gland tissue) weighing 12 g in total, which clearly identifies the specimen type as prostate tissue. Although the exact source (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not specified, the tissue type itself is unambiguous.	: Partially  	: The report describes “histologisia merkkejä epäilyttävistä muutoksista” (histological signs of suspicious changes) and “merkittäviä muutoksia on 50 % koko pinnasta” (significant changes in 50 % of the surface), but it explicitly states “Gleason systeemin mukaan ei määritelty löydöksiä” (no findings defined according to the Gleason system). This indicates that malignancy is strongly suspected but not formally confirmed or graded. Therefore, malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: Because the report explicitly states that no Gleason grading was performed (“Gleason systeemin mukaan ei määritelty löydöksiä”), no major, minor, or sum scores are provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to a lay reader with minimal domain knowledge.
322	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	1	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips) together with the mention of “3 blokissa” clearly indicates that the material is TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “vain benignejä piirteitä” (only benign features), so malignancy status is unambiguously negative.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise, grammatically correct, and understandable even to a lay reader; the abbreviations T and M are standard internal codes and do not impede comprehension.
323	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	1	1	: No  	: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) but never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. The phrase “3 blokissa” only tells us the material was processed into three blocks, not the original sample type.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “vain sekalaisia ominaisuuksia” (only miscellaneous/varied features) and gives no indication of malignancy. There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignant finding.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is not relevant. The fields “T=, M=” are left empty, offering no data from which to infer a Gleason score.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is concise and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “YHTEENVETO” and “sekalaisia ominaisuuksia.” No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
324	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and lists left- and right-sided cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “VAIN BENIGN PIIRTEITÄ” (only benign features) and no mention of carcinoma, so the findings are confirmed benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is concise and understandable despite minor non-standard Finnish spelling (“benigniä”). The meaning is clear to a lay reader.
325	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly mentions “eturauhasnäytettä” (prostate samples) and gives the number of cores from each side (6 from the left, 5 from the right), so the sample type is identifiable as prostate biopsies.  	: No  	: The report describes only inflammatory changes (“akuuttia ja kroonista inflammaatiota”, “inflammatiota”) and explicitly states “Ei PIN-muutoksia” (no PIN changes). There is no mention of carcinoma or any malignant finding, so malignancy cannot be assessed as present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is concise and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology (e.g., “eturauhasnäytettä”, “inflammatiota”, “PIN-muutoksia”) appropriate for a pathology report.
326	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “ei löydetty jäännös maligniteetteja” (no residual malignancies were found) and “vain benign piirteitä” (only benign features), so the absence of malignancy is explicitly confirmed.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignant tissue was identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices such as “maligniteeteista” (instead of “maligniteeteistä”) are acceptable within the domain.
327	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ETURAUHASNÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The text states “löydettiin sekalaista tulehdusjäännöstä” (mixed inflammatory residue was found) and “Löydökset epävarmoja” (findings are uncertain). There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any malignant diagnosis, only inconclusive inflammatory changes. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the formatting is awkward (e.g., empty fields “T= , , M =”). “ANTERIORINEN RASVA” should probably be “ANTERIORINEN RASVAKUDOS” for clarity. Overall, the meaning is clear to a lay reader, but minor grammatical and formatting issues are present.
328	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates that the sample type is TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Ei maligniteettia” (no malignancy) and “VAIN INFLAMMAATIOTA” (only inflammation), so the absence of malignant findings is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading was performed or reported; therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable, even for a layperson. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalisation (“VAIN INFLAMMAATIOTA”) are acceptable in this domain.
329	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Vaikeuksia määrittää löytöjä” (difficulties in determining the findings) and lists only “akuuttia ja kroonista tulehdusta” (acute and chronic inflammation) and “sekalaisia piirteitä” (miscellaneous features). No mention of malignancy is provided, and the inconclusive wording prevents any assessment of cancer status.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore assessment of Gleason scores is not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the sentence “Saadut prostatanäytteet tutkittu kokonaisuudessaan blokissa” lacks a verb (should be “tutkittiin”). The abbreviations “T=, M=,” are left incomplete. These are minor issues that do not impede overall comprehension.
330	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “AINOASTAAN BENIGN PIIRTEITÄ” (only benign features) and both left and right sides are described as benign cylinders with no invasive malignancy, PIN, or inflammation. Therefore malignancy status is unambiguously assessed as absent.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise, uses standard Finnish medical terminology, and is readily understandable to clinicians or informed laypersons.
331	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “fragmentoitunutta eturauhasnäytettä” (fragmented prostate samples) and “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens.  	: Partially  	: The left side shows “PIN-muutoksia” (PIN changes) and “muita muodostumia” (other formations), which raises suspicion of neoplasia, but no explicit statement of adenocarcinoma is given. The right side is explicitly negative. Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor clearly ruled out for the left side, the malignancy status is only partially assessable.  	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided or implied anywhere in the text.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology; a layman might need clarification on “PIN-muutoksia” and “muodostumia,” but the overall grammar and clarity are acceptable.
332	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary section, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides a Gleason score, confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The primary and secondary Gleason grades are given as 3 and 3, respectively, and the total Gleason score is stated as 6. This allows the standard format 3+3=6 to be inferred directly.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear medical Finnish with standard terminology. While it contains some abbreviations and domain-specific phrasing, it remains comprehensible to a lay reader with minimal medical background.
333	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (capsule, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, margins, dominant nodule, etc.). Although the word “radikaaliprostektomia” is not written, the context makes the sample type unambiguous.	: Partially  	: The report repeatedly leaves the Gleason score blank and states “ETURAUHASNÄYTE – , GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” This phrasing neither confirms malignancy nor explicitly denies it; it merely indicates that no cancer was identified or that the data were not recorded. Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully assessed.	: No  	: The fields for primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason patterns are all empty and the final summary lists “GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” No numeric values are provided, so a major+minor=sum triplet cannot be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The report is understandable, but the repeated commas without values (“GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .”) and the slightly awkward “ETURAUHANEN” heading instead of “Radikaaliprostektomia” could confuse a lay reader. Minor re-phrasing (e.g. “Gleason-arvoa ei voitu määrittää”) would improve clarity.
334	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Ei invasiivista tautia” (no invasive disease), which confirms the absence of invasive (malignant) carcinoma. PIN lesions are noted, but these are not invasive malignancy.	: No  	: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is concise and understandable; minor domain-specific abbreviations (PIN, T=, M=) are acceptable in pathology reports.
335	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and “blokissa” (in the block), so we know the material is prostatic tissue, but it does not specify whether the samples are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue.  	: Partially  	: The statement explicitly says “Ei voida määrittää invasiivisen taudin tyyppiä” (the type of invasive disease cannot be determined) and only reports PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). Therefore we cannot conclude whether invasive carcinoma is present or absent; the malignancy status remains indeterminate.  	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the presence of PIN alone does not allow any Gleason score to be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is concise and understandable; only minor stylistic omissions (e.g., missing article before “blokissa”) are typical of pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
336	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and the left/right descriptions confirm that the material consists of needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The report clearly states that no invasive malignancy was found; only high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is present on the left side, while the right side is entirely benign. Thus malignancy status is assessable as negative.  	: No  	: No Gleason grading is provided or implied, because no invasive adenocarcinoma was identified. Gleason scores are only assigned to malignant (invasive) tissue.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise and uses standard Finnish histopathology terminology. While abbreviations such as “PIN” and the numeric codes (T=77100, M=09450) may not be immediately clear to a layman, they are conventional in pathology reports and the overall message is understandable.
337	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteitä / prostatanäytettä” (prostate samples) and “6 prostatanäytettä” (6 prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not specify whether these are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens.  	: Partially  	: The left side is reported to show “PIN-muutoksia” (PIN changes), which are atypical but not overtly malignant. No mention of adenocarcinoma is made. The right side states that changes “ei ole mahdollista määrittää” (cannot be determined). Thus malignancy status is inconclusive rather than clearly benign or malignant.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text. PIN alone does not yield a Gleason grade.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable but contains shorthand and fragmented sentences (e.g., “T=, M=”). A layman would grasp the gist, yet clearer wording such as “vasemmanpuoleisissa näytteissä todettiin PIN-muutoksia, mutta ei adenokarsinoomaa” would improve readability.
338	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides multiple malignant descriptors (extraprostatic extension, positive apex margin, perineural invasion), confirming malignancy.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 3, the secondary as 4, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7, so the format 3+4=7 is directly available.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are appropriate for a pathology report. Minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “ANTERIORINEN RASVA”) and occasional Finnish terms do not impede understanding for a lay reader familiar with medical reports.
339	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	1	1	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ETURAUHASEN RASVAKUDOS” (periprostatic adipose tissue), which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  	: No  	: Although the report lists all the fields required for a prostatectomy report, every field that would indicate malignancy (tumour type, Gleason scores, tumour size, extraprostatic extension, margin status, etc.) is either left blank or stated as “Ei voida määrittää muutoksia” (changes cannot be determined). The summary states “PUHDAS” (clean) for the adipose tissue and margins, but does not confirm the presence or absence of carcinoma in the prostate itself. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, overall Gleason score) are empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which Gleason scores could be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is standard Finnish medical terminology and is understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge. Minor stylistic omissions (e.g., missing punctuation after “GRADE GROUP”) do not impede comprehension.
340	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates the sample type is TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  	: Yes  	: The text states “Ei havaittu maligniteettia” (no malignancy observed) and the summary lists “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore, the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=77100, M=72440” are standard pathology codes and do not impede comprehension.
341	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate specimens), so it is clear that the material is prostate tissue. However, no specific sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The description speaks of “rauhasten ja stroomien hyperplasiaa” (glandular and stromal hyperplasia) and “muita muutoksia” (other changes), which are benign findings. There is no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed as present.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not mentioned and cannot be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the phrase “edustavasti tutkittu blokeissa” is slightly awkward; “edustavasti” is likely intended to mean “representatively” or “adequately,” but the more standard wording would be “edustavasti tutkittu kudoslohkoissa” or “edustavasti tutkittu leikkeissä.” The line “T=, M=” is left empty, which is acceptable as a placeholder but could be clarified.
342	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIA” (prostate biopsy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The report states that the glands are “moderately atypical” and “not malignant,” but it also mentions ASAP (atypical small acinar proliferation) and PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). These are premalignant or suspicious findings rather than overt malignancy. Therefore, malignancy status is not definitively established.	: No  	: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or can be inferred from the text.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology.
343	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytettä” (prostate samples) and distinguishes “VASEN” and “OIKEA” (left and right), but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly states they “cannot determine whether [the findings] are malignant or relate to atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) associated with PIN.” Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can any be inferred from the description.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prostatanäytettä” without an article) are typical in medical Finnish and do not impede understanding.
344	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The report states “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides a Gleason score, confirming malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the total Gleason score is stated as 7. From this, the format 4+3=7 can be directly inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable; minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “ANTERIORINEN RASVA”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
345	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), which clearly indicates the material is prostate tissue. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Kasvaintyyppi: Ei pystytty tunnistamaan” (tumour type: could not be identified) and the final summary says the prostate samples “EI VOITU MÄÄRITTÄÄ NÄYTEKONTAMINAATION TAKIA” (could not be determined due to sample contamination). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” (missing). Since malignancy itself could not be determined, no Gleason pattern or score can be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard Finnish pathological reporting language. While a layman might need help with some terms (e.g., “perineuraalinen invaasio”), the overall structure and clarity are appropriate for the intended medical audience.
346	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which is the Finnish term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “vain benign piirteitä” (only benign features) and “näkyvillä vain benign tunnusmerkkejä” (only benign characteristics visible). This unambiguously indicates that no malignancy was found.  	: Not applicable  	: Since the findings are explicitly benign, no Gleason grading is provided or required; Gleason scores are only relevant for malignant tissue.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable despite minor spelling issues (“inflamamatiota” should be “inflammaatiota”). The overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
347	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they were examined “kokonaan blokeissa” (in blocks), which implies a biopsy or TURP setting, but the exact sample type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. RP) is never explicitly stated.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states that the samples were “kontaminoituneet” (contaminated) and therefore “tutkimuksia ei voida jatkaa” (examination cannot be continued). No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; only “epäilyttäviä löytöjä” (suspicious findings) and “kroonista inflammaatiota” (chronic inflammation) are mentioned, which does not allow a determination of malignancy.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical phrasing. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “T=, M=” is left blank) do not impede comprehension.
348	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and describes findings from both left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are explicitly stated: “infiltroitunut asinaarisella adenokarsinoomalla” (infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma) in the right-sided samples, while the left side is benign. Thus malignancy status is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly: “primääri Gleason arvo 4, sekundääri 3” and summarised as “MAKSIMI GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3)”. This provides major + minor = sum (4+3=7) in standard format.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear Finnish medical terminology. While abbreviations like “PIN” and codes “T=77100, M=81403” may not be familiar to laypersons, the overall structure and language are appropriate for a pathology report.
349	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytteitä” (prostate samples) and distinguishes between left and right sides, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as prostate biopsies, not unambiguously confirmed.	: No  	: The statement does not declare the findings benign or malignant. It mentions “PIN” (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and “sekalaisia löytöjä” (miscellaneous findings) that are “vaikea tulkita” (difficult to interpret). PIN is a premalignant change, not overt carcinoma, and the rest is inconclusive. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no adenocarcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “sekalaisia löytöjä”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
350	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and gives a Gleason score of 8, confirming malignancy.	: Yes  	: Both primary and secondary Gleason grades are given as 4, and the sum is explicitly stated as Gleason score 8 (4+4).	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology. While some abbreviations and technical terms (e.g., “cribriform kasvua”, “duktaalista fenotyyppiä”) may require domain knowledge, the overall grammar and clarity are appropriate for a pathology report.
351	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATARASVA”, which clearly indicate that the material is from the prostate. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Ei viitteitä mistään malignista” (no evidence of malignancy) for the anterior fat, but for the prostate specimens it concludes “EPÄSELVÄT JA SEKALAISET LÖYDÖKSET, VAATII LISÄTUTKIMUKSIA” (unclear and mixed findings, requires further studies). Because the findings are inconclusive, malignancy cannot be assessed as either present or absent.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields are marked “Ei määritetty” (not determined) or “-”. No numerical values or patterns are provided, so the Gleason score cannot be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard medical Finnish and would be understandable to a clinician. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalisation and hyphen usage are acceptable in pathology reports.
352	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “lastut” (chips) and that they were examined in four blocks, which clearly indicates the sample type is trans-urethral resection (TUR-P) chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement reports the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma (“eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa”) in an estimated 27 % of the chips, so malignancy is confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 3 + 4 = 7, fulfilling the required format.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and domain-appropriate; any lay reader would understand that cancer was found and what the Gleason score is.
353	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they were examined “kokonaan blokeissa” (entirely in blocks), which implies a histopathology specimen set. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type remains unspecified.  	: No  	: The summary line “SEKALAISIA LÖYDÖKSIÄ, TARVITAAN JATKOTUTKIMUKSIA” (“mixed findings, further studies needed”) explicitly indicates that no definitive benign or malignant diagnosis has been reached. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy status itself is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and concise; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are typical shorthand in pathology reports and do not impede understanding.
354	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and distinguishes between left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported on the left side: “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) is stated, along with Gleason scores and additional malignant features such as perineural invasion. The right side is described as benign. Therefore, malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “primääri Gleason arvo 3 ja sekundääri 3” and summarized as “Gleason score 6 (3+3)”. Thus, major + minor = sum (3+3=6) is explicitly provided.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear Finnish medical terminology. While some abbreviations (e.g., “T=77100, M=81403”) are cryptic to a layman, the core histopathological information is understandable and the grammar is correct.
355	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly refers to “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes between left and right sides, indicating that the material consists of prostate biopsies.	: Partially  	: The left side is described as having “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä” (suspicious findings) with possible perineural invasion, strongly suggesting malignancy, but the wording remains tentative (“saattaa olla”). The right side is explicitly benign with PIN changes. Because malignancy is not unequivocally confirmed, the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The summary explicitly states “EI VOIDA MÄÄRITTÄÄ MAKSIMI GLEASON SCOREA JA GRADE GROUPIA” (maximum Gleason score and grade group cannot be determined), so no valid Gleason pattern can be extracted.	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable; minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “benign” instead of “benignit”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not impede comprehension.
356	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The report clearly identifies “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma) and provides extensive malignant findings, so malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 4, the secondary as 5, and the sum is explicitly stated as 9 (4+5=9). Although a tertiary pattern of 3 is mentioned, it is correctly excluded from the score.	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology understandable to professionals and lay readers familiar with the domain. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., capitalization, spacing) do not impede comprehension.
357	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), which clearly indicates the organ examined, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Kasvaimen tyyppi: Epäselvä” (tumour type unclear) and “EI VOIDA VARMISTAA LÖYDÖKSIÄ” (findings cannot be confirmed). These phrases indicate that malignancy cannot be assessed from the information provided.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primäärinen, sekundäärinen, tertiäärinen, Gleason score) are left blank. No numerical or descriptive Gleason information is supplied, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but it contains inconsistent punctuation (e.g., “Ympärysmarginaali:,” with a trailing comma) and some abbreviations or shorthand that may confuse lay readers. The phrase “Vaatii lisätutkimuksia” is clear, yet the overall structure could be improved for readability.
358	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), and the context (TUR-P codes T=77100, M=81403) confirms that the sample type is transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) chips.  	: Yes  	: The statement clearly reports the presence of adenocarcinoma (“eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa”) in 8 of 104 chips and repeats this in the summary (“ADENOKARSINOOMA”).  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3) in both the narrative and the summary, so the major, minor and sum scores are directly inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and domain-appropriate; minor Finnish abbreviations (e.g., “lastut”, “eli noin”) are acceptable in a pathology report and do not impede understanding.
359	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The statement only says that “about 8 samples contain suspicious changes” and that the findings are “unclear / inconclusive” (“epäselvät löydökset”). There is no confirmation of malignancy, nor a definitive statement that the findings are benign. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor denied, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and concise; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are domain-specific and acceptable in a pathology summary.
360	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	1	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and refers to left- and right-sided cylinders (“sylinterit”), confirming the sample type as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Both left and right sides describe “infiltroitunut asinaarinen adenokarsinooma” (infiltrated acinar adenocarcinoma), clearly indicating malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly for each side: primary 3 and secondary 4. The summary states “MAKSIMI GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4)”, providing the major + minor = sum format (3+4=7).  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear Finnish medical terminology. While abbreviations like “T=77100, M=81403” are SNOMED codes and may not be immediately understandable to a layman, the rest of the text is grammatically correct and comprehensible within the medical domain.
361	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	1	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and describes six samples from the left side and seven from the right side, clearly indicating that the material consists of prostate biopsies.  	: No  	: Although suspicious infiltrative changes are described, the report explicitly states that the findings are “epäselviä” (unclear) and that “lisäperehtyminen tarpeen” (further work-up is needed). No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no definite adenocarcinoma is diagnosed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor typographical issues (“maksimipiruus” likely intended “maksimipituus”). Overall it is appropriate for clinical communication.
362	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The statement lists “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma) and provides a final summary confirming malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 3, the secondary as 5, and the sum is explicitly stated as 8 (3+5=8).  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor non-standard capitalization and punctuation (e.g., “Ei YHTEENVETO”) do not impede comprehension.
363	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (margins, seminal-vesicle invasion, etc.), which implies the sample is prostate tissue. However, it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Kasvaintyyppi: EPÄSELVÄ” (tumour type unclear) and “EI voida määrittää löydöksiä” (findings cannot be determined). Therefore malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings are inconclusive.  	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” (missing). Because no tumour was identified, no Gleason pattern or score can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is standard medical Finnish and understandable to a layman with basic medical terminology knowledge. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., “PROSTATA” vs. “PROSTATANÄYTTEET”) do not impede comprehension.
364	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “lastut” (chips) and that they were examined in 7 blocks, which clearly indicates the sample type is prostate needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that approximately 40 % of the chips contain “Gleason 5+5=10 eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa” (prostate adenocarcinoma), and the summary line repeats “ADENOKARSINOOMA”. Thus malignancy is unambiguously confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 5 + 5 = 10 in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum components are directly available.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear Finnish understandable to a layman; only minor stylistic choices (e.g., “nähdään” instead of “todetaan”) are domain-typical and do not impede comprehension.
365	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that the samples were examined “kokonaisuudessaan blokeissa” (in their entirety in blocks), which implies tissue blocks from a prostate specimen. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: Partially  	: The report states that “noin 40 % nähdään epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (about 40 % show suspicious changes) and lists “PROSTATANÄYTTEET: EPÄILYTTÄVIÄ MUUTOKSIA”. The word “epäilyttäviä” (suspicious) indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed; the findings are equivocal rather than clearly benign or malignant. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) or any information from which Gleason grading could be inferred are provided.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic points (e.g., the empty “T=, M=”) are common in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
366	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) and lists the specimen parts (anterior fat, prostate), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally diagnoses “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) in both the anterior fat (metastatic focus) and the prostate itself, so malignancy is confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The report gives the primary Gleason pattern 5 and secondary pattern 3, explicitly stating “Gleason score: 8” and “5+3”. Thus the major+minor=sum format (5+3=8) is directly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology understandable to professionals; lay readers might need clarification for some terms, but overall it is clear and grammatically correct.
367	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäyte” (prostate sample) and lists fields such as “apexmarginaali”, “basismarginaali” and “ympärysmarginaali”, which are typical of a radical prostatectomy report. However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “epäselvä luokittelu” (classification unclear) and “luokittelu jää auki” (classification left open). No malignant diagnosis is given; only “joitakin epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (some suspicious changes) are mentioned. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primäärinen, sekundäärinen, tertiäärinen Gleason arvo and Gleason score) are left blank. No valid way to infer the scores is provided.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but it mixes Finnish and English terms (e.g., “Gleason score”, “UICC TNM 8th edition”) and leaves several fields empty, which may confuse a lay reader. Minor grammatical issues such as missing punctuation and inconsistent capitalization are present.
368	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) and separately lists “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ANTERIORINEN RASVA” (anterior fat), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The report states “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) in both the anterior fat focus and the prostate itself, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Primäärinen Gleason arvo: 5” and “Sekundäärinen Gleason arvo: 3”, and explicitly states “Gleason score: 8” and “Gleason score 8 (5+3)”, so the major + minor = sum format (5+3=8) is directly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable; minor Finnish-specific abbreviations (e.g., “pT3b”, “pNx”) are standard in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
369	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTE”, which clearly indicate the specimen is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: Although the report lists fields for Gleason scores and tumour characteristics, every numeric field is left blank and the descriptive text repeatedly states “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and “epäselvä luokittelu” (classification unclear). No definitive statement of malignancy or benignity is provided, so the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, total score) are explicitly empty. The text offers no numeric or descriptive information from which a Gleason score could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The report is generally understandable, but the repeated use of empty fields and the phrase “epäselvä luokittelu” may confuse a lay reader. Minor grammatical issues include inconsistent capitalisation and the unfinished “T=,, M =’”.
370	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement mentions “lastut” (chips) and “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates that the material examined consists of prostate biopsy cores. No other sample type is suggested.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that 17/257 chips contained “Gleason 4+5=9 eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa” (prostate adenocarcinoma). The summary section repeats “ADENOKARSINOMA”, confirming the malignant nature of the findings.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as 4+5=9, and the Grade Group 5 is also provided. This is sufficient to infer the major pattern (4), minor pattern (5), and sum (9).	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is standard medical terminology and is readily understandable to professionals and informed laypersons. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “lastut tutkittiin kokonaisuudessaan 14 blokissa”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
371	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they have been examined “kokonaisuudessaan blokeissa” (in their entirety in blocks), which implies a histopathology specimen. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsies, TUR-P chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The statement only reports “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “kategorisointi mahdotonta” (categorisation impossible). It neither confirms malignancy nor confirms benignity. Therefore the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor denied, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are standard placeholders in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
372	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	93	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and distinguishes between left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Malignancy is unequivocally reported on the left side (“infiltroitunutta asinaarista adenokarsinoomaa”) and explicitly ruled out on the right (“ei maligniteetteja”).  	: Yes  	: The summary line gives the Gleason score directly as “4+5=9” and also states “Grade Group 5”, so the major, minor and sum scores are fully provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is standard medical terminology; while a layman may need translation, the grammar and clarity are correct for a pathology report.
373	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	93	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes left vs right, so we know the material is prostate biopsies. However, the exact type (needle biopsy, TURP, etc.) is not specified.	: No  	: The report describes “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) whose nature is “epäselvä” (unclear). No explicit statement of malignancy or benignity is given; the findings are inconclusive.	: No  	: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason pattern or score is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Finnish is understandable, but the punctuation is inconsistent (e.g., “OIKEA .” with a space before the period) and the Gleason fields “T=, M=” are left blank. These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
374	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	1	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The report identifies “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides staging (pT2 pN0 M0), confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The report gives the primary Gleason 4 and secondary Gleason 3, and explicitly states “Gleason score 7 (4+3)”, from which the major+minor=sum format (4+3=7) is directly inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology and is understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge. Minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “ANTERIORINEN RASVA”) does not impede comprehension.
375	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	1	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), so the organ is clear. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. The presence of lymph-node dissection (obturator and iliac nodes) strongly implies a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, but this is not spelled out.	: Partially  	: The prostate tissue shows “joitain epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (some suspicious changes) and “epäselvä Gleason luokitus” (unclear Gleason grading). This wording indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings are inconclusive. All lymph nodes are negative, but the primary prostate specimen itself is not declared benign.	: No  	: The report explicitly states that Gleason grading is unclear (“epäselvä Gleason luokitus”) and leaves the Gleason score fields blank. Therefore, no valid major + minor = sum score can be extracted.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish text is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., missing spaces after colons) do not impede comprehension.
376	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	95	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “lastut” (chips/slices) and that they were examined in 9 blocks, clearly indicating the sample type is prostate needle-biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The text states that adenocarcinoma was found in an estimated 15/153 chips and repeats this in the summary: “ADENOKARSINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 8 (3 + 5) GRADE GROUP 5”. Thus malignancy is unequivocally reported.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as 3 + 5 = 8, satisfying the required format.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is clear and concise; medical terminology is used correctly. No grammatical or comprehension issues are present.

However, it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement only reports “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “vaatii jatkotutkimuksia” (requires further investigations). It neither confirms malignancy nor benignity, so the malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor shorthand like “T=, M=” is common in pathology reports.
378	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and describes findings from left- and right-sided cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as bilateral prostate biopsies.	: Yes  	: Both left and right sides are reported to contain infiltrating acinar adenocarcinoma, confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The summary states “MAKSIMI GLEASON SCORE 10 (5+5)”, which directly provides the major and minor Gleason patterns (5 + 5) and the sum (10).	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in clear Finnish medical terminology understandable to professionals; minor non-standard abbreviations (e.g., “T=77100, M=81403”) do not impede comprehension.
379	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes left and right sides, but it never explicitly states whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “some form of prostate tissue” rather than clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The report describes “infiltrated by suspicious changes whose nature is unclear” and notes perineural invasion on the left side. These features strongly suggest malignancy, yet the pathologist deliberately labels the findings “unclear” and ends with “requires additional studies.” Thus malignancy is strongly implied but not formally declared.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the descriptive text.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish wording is understandable and uses standard medical phrasing. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “15 m” instead of “15 mm”) are evident but do not impede comprehension.
380	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	1	0	: Yes  	: The report clearly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is explicitly given.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly identifies “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) in the prostate specimen and mentions metastatic carcinoma in lymph nodes, so malignancy is unambiguously confirmed.	: Yes  	: The report lists “Primääri Gleason arvo: 5”, “Sekundääri Gleason arvo: 5”, and “Gleason score: 10”, which directly translates to Gleason 5 + 5 = 10.	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in clear Finnish medical terminology that is understandable to professionals and reasonably accessible to informed laypersons. Minor non-standard capitalisation and hyphenation do not impede comprehension.
381	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	1	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and lists several prostate-specific parameters (Gleason fields, margins, extraprostatic extension, etc.), so we can infer the specimen is a radical prostatectomy. However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, hence only “Partially”.	: No  	: The prostate section is completely blank—no tumour type, no Gleason scores, no size, no extension. The summary line says “JOITAIN EPÄILYTTÄVIÄ MUUTOKSIA, EI MÄÄRITELTÄVISSÄ” (“some suspicious changes, not definable, further studies needed”). This explicitly indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the findings are inconclusive.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, total score) are left empty. Because malignancy itself is not established, no Gleason score can be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The Finnish is clear and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalisation and spacing are acceptable in pathology reports. The lay reader can grasp that the prostate specimen shows uncertain changes requiring further work-up, while lymph-node and fat tissues appear benign.
382	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	1	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “virtsaputken kautta tehty resektio” (resection via the urethra), which corresponds to a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) sample. Therefore, the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text states that “löytyi todisteita adenokarsinoomasta” (evidence of adenocarcinoma was found), confirming the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “major 4 ja minor 3”, allowing the sum to be inferred as 4+3=7. Thus, the Gleason score in the required format can be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a few grammatical or stylistic issues (e.g., “kasvaimettomalla alueella nähtävissä benign hyperplasiaa” mixes Finnish and English terminology, and “kasvaimettomalla” is slightly awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but minor corrections would improve clarity.
383	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	1	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “näytteet” (samples) weighing 10 g, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The weight alone is compatible with TURP or multiple biopsies, so the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.	: Yes  	: The text clearly describes “epäilyttävistä muutoksista” (suspicious changes) with “epäily GLEASON patternista” (suspicion of Gleason pattern), mentions both major and minor components, and refers to cribriform structures. These phrases unequivocally indicate malignant findings.	: Partially  	: The major component is said to cover ~40 % of the tissue and the minor component ~10 %. However, no explicit Gleason pattern numbers (e.g., 3, 4, or 5) are given for either component, so the exact major+minor=sum cannot be derived. Only the relative proportions are provided.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but some phrasing is awkward or non-standard (e.g., “epäily GLEASON patternista” instead of “epäily Gleason-kuviosta”, “minor komponentit” instead of “minor-komponentit”). These are minor domain-specific quirks and do not impede comprehension.
384	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Hyvlingspånar” (chips/shavings) clearly indicates that the material is TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) chips, so the sample type is identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that no malignancy, atypia or carcinoma was found and that only benign prostatic tissue was observed, so the benign nature of the findings is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma was identified, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The wording is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g. “fåtts”, “igångsatts”). The message is clear to a lay reader.
385	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	0	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) and describes the amount of material, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, not the specific procedure.  	: No  	: The sentence “ingen slutsats … kan inte göras” (a double negative that actually means “a conclusion cannot be drawn”) explicitly states that no conclusion about malignancy, atypia, or carcinoma can be reached. Hence, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains grammatical errors (double negative “kan inte göras”, awkward phrasing “utverkas”, “igångsatts i flera sats”, “materialen kan inte dras slutsats”). These issues hinder clear understanding for a lay reader and should be corrected for clarity.
386	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “12 representative nålbiopsier” (needle biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies taken from typical sites.  	: No  	: The report describes “normala körtelstrukturer” and “benignliknande växt” and does not mention any malignant findings. However, it does not explicitly state that the examination verified only benign findings; it merely says the result is “mostly benign-like.” Therefore, malignancy status cannot be definitively assessed as confirmed benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor spelling/grammar issues: “represetantive” should be “representativa,” “provar” should be “prover,” “år” should be “är,” and “några vågig hyperplastiskt likande epitel” is awkward; better phrased as “något vågigt, hyperplastiskt liknande epitel.”
387	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	1	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) and “bestämd ställerna” (specified sites), which implies biopsies, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The conclusion is explicitly stated as “ännu i vardande” (still pending) and “blir färdig snart” (will be ready soon). No information is given about whether malignant or benign findings were observed, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “bestämd ställerna” should be “bestämda ställen” (definite sites), and “Ses bland annat körtelstrukturer” would be clearer as “Man ser bland annat körtelstrukturer”. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
388	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikal prostatektomiprov” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states that all examined sections show “normal, benign växt” and that resection margins, capsule and seminal vesicles are free of tumour (“rena av tumör växt”). Thus malignancy is explicitly ruled out.	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is found, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains several minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g. “makrosnitter” should be “makroskopiska snitt”, “obduktion prov” → “obduktionsprov”, “avsedd” → “avsett”, “växt suggestiv av hyperplasi” → “vävnad suggestiv för hyperplasi”, “bekräftad rena” → “bekräftas rena”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but would benefit from polishing.
389	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	2	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that the material comes from an autopsy (“obduktion”) and is intended for research, but it does not explicitly name the specimen type in standard clinical terms (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that no firm conclusion can be drawn because inflammation and age-related changes dominate. It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; it merely suggests that further sampling might be needed to assess a possible adenocarcinoma. Thus, the malignancy status is not assessable from this statement.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor described, no Gleason grading information is provided or can be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “frän vilken beställas”, “avslöjas”, “i materialet”). These do not prevent comprehension, but they are noticeable and could be improved for clarity.
390	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “spånor” (chips) together with the weight “12.3 g” clearly indicates that the specimen is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “Ses ingenting som indikerar malignitet” (“Nothing indicating malignancy is seen”), which definitively conveys that no malignant findings were present.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading was performed or reported; therefore the Gleason score is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; while “Igångsatts på en kassett” is slightly telegraphic, it is still clear to a histopathologist and causes no real comprehension issues.
391	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	3	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostate material” and that it was “started at once”, which implies a fresh tissue specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that burn artefacts prevent reliable analysis and “no conclusive conclusion can be drawn”. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g. “liten över dussin gram”, “igångsatts på en gång”, “sådeles ingen konklusiv slutsats kan inte dras”). A clearer version would be: “Primärprovet består av lite över ett dussin gram prostatavävnad som bearbetades omedelbart. Vid histologisk undersökning ses viss inflammation, men brännskador hindrar säker analys. Därför kan ingen säker slutsats dras från detta prov.”
392	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and refers to “prov 1-6” (samples 1-6), clearly indicating that the material consists of multiple needle biopsies taken from typical locations.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “Man hittar inte carcinoma eller PIN-förändring” (no carcinoma or PIN changes are found). This unambiguously conveys that no malignant findings were present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma was detected, no Gleason grading was performed or reported. Therefore, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a few grammatical and spelling issues: “trädje” should be “tredje”, “represerande” should be “representativa”, and “Det också finns inte” should be “Det finns inte heller”. These errors do not prevent comprehension but slightly detract from clarity.
393	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	4	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “standard ställerna” (standard sites) and “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue), which implies prostate biopsies, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the information is only partially extractable.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that the tissue is insufficient for a secure analysis of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes. It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; the findings are inconclusive. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g. “En prov ser inte ut representativ”, “PIN-likadan förändringars”). A layman would grasp the gist, but the wording could be clearer.
394	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikal prostatektomiprov” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “tumör vävnad” (tumour tissue) is found in both apex macro-blocks (A and B), confirming malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: Gleason scores are provided for the two tumour-containing blocks: 4+3=7 in block A and 4+5=9 in block B. However, the statement does not give an overall Gleason score for the entire specimen (e.g., the highest or global score), so the complete Gleason information in the requested format (major+minor=sum) for the whole case cannot be fully inferred.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but it contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Sättas” should be “Sätts”, “vesiklen” should be “vesikeln”, “andra prostatas makroblock rena” is missing a verb). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
395	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	5	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “förstorad prostata” (enlarged prostate) and describes sections from left and right sides, apex and base, implying a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that major and minor Gleason grades “kunde inte säkert bestämdes” (could not be determined with certainty). It also refers the case to a colleague for further examination. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement alone.	: No  	: Because Gleason grades (major and minor) could not be determined, no valid Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “snitter från både apex och basis igångsattes”, “det är trolig att prostatas kapsel är hel”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
396	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “hyvlingspånor” (shavings), which is the standard term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: No  	: The microscopic description states “fynd tyder på benign hyperplasi” (findings indicate benign hyperplasia). There is no mention of malignancy; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is irrelevant and cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “igångsätts” should probably be “inkläms” or “läggs in”, and “brännartefakter” is acceptable jargon but could be written as “brännskador” for clarity.
397	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	6	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “original prostatas behandlingmaterial” (original prostate treatment material), which implies a therapeutic specimen (likely TURP or radical prostatectomy fragments), but it does not explicitly state the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The statement concludes that “jämförelsevis normal prostatavävnad” (comparatively normal prostate tissue) was seen, but immediately adds that most material could not be examined adequately due to severe cautery artefacts. The final sentence explicitly says the result is “inte övertygande” (not convincing). Because the examination was inconclusive, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: Since no malignant findings were reported and the examination was inconclusive, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical and spelling issues (e.g., “Konstaters” should be “Konstateras”, “noggrannt” should be “noggrant”, “recommenderad” should be “rekommenderad”). These errors are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
398	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and mentions the total length of the tissue, confirming the sample type as needle biopsies.	: Partially  	: The report describes a “fokus med liten körtelstrukturer med stroma-atypi” that “kanske motsvarar adenocarcinoma” but immediately adds that “hittas ingen klara adenocarcinoma” and the conclusion remains “en misstanke.” Thus, malignancy is suspected but not confirmed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The message is understandable, but the Swedish contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “tagit” should be “tagna,” “längdt” should be “längd,” “klara adenocarcinoma” should be “klart adenocarcinom”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
399	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	7	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostataprovmaterial” (prostate specimen material) and that it was collected “enligt rutin anvisning” (according to routine instructions), which implies a prostate-related sample. However, it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.), so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The pathologist describes “atypiska strukturer och morfologiska förändringar” (atypical structures and morphological changes) but explicitly concludes that “ingen definitiv slutsats kunde dras” (no definitive conclusion could be drawn). Therefore, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable. The phrasing is slightly informal (“intressant fynd”, “försvinnande litet”), but this is acceptable in a pathology report context.
400	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikalprostatektomi preparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) in prov 3, so the sample type is clearly identified. Prov 1 and 2 are described as lymph-node samples, which are additional specimens from the same case.	: Yes  	: The text states that “tumörvävnad” (tumor tissue) is found in both lobes of the prostatectomy specimen, confirming a malignant finding. It also explicitly rules out malignancy in the examined lymph nodes (“Ingen malign fynd i utredda lymfkörtlar”).	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+3=7” and is explicitly tied to the highest-grade growth pattern observed. No further inference is needed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several spelling/grammatical issues:  
401	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	8	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prov 1 och 2” and “prov 3” and refers to “prostatavävnad”, which implies prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.  	: Partially  	: The text explicitly says that specimens 1 and 2 are “fri av malignitet” (free of malignancy). For specimen 3 the wording is ambiguous: “möjligen intressant egenskaper”, “varying growth patterns”, “högst identifierad Gleason grad värkas att sakna”, and “tvivel av PIN-förändringar” all point to uncertainty rather than a clear malignant diagnosis. Thus malignancy status for specimen 3 cannot be definitively assessed.  	: No  	: The Gleason information is explicitly missing: “i tabell är märkat ? och ? i platser av major och minor”. No numerical values (major + minor = sum) are provided, and the text even questions whether Gleason grading was omitted or mis-recorded.  	: Major mistakes  	: The statement contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (“värkas att sakna”, “ögonskenlig”, “indentifierad”, “grad själv saknas, möjlig misskrivning”). These errors hinder readability and could confuse a lay reader. Suggested revision: “Prov 1 och 2 innehåller icke-primär vävnad och är fria från malignitet. Prov 3 består av prostatavävnad; undersökningen visar varierande tillväxtmönster i cirka 10 % av vävnaden. Ingen Gleason-grad kunde fastställas; tabellen anger frågetecken för både major och minor. PIN-förändringar diskuterades men kunde inte bekräftas.”
402	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostata elektrosektion spånor” (electro-resection chips from the prostate), which clearly identifies the sample type as TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) material.  	: Yes  	: The text states “Ingen malignitet kommer fram” (no malignancy is found) and concludes that the findings are consistent with benign hyperplasia. This unambiguously indicates that the findings are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was identified, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) can or should be provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in clear, understandable Swedish with only minor stylistic deviations typical of pathology reports. A layperson can grasp the main points: sample type, amount examined, and benign outcome.
403	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	9	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) and describes handling of “provmaterial” (specimen material), but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, not the specific clinical context.	: No  	: The text explicitly says “epitelets rand ser ut normal” (epithelial edge looks normal) and “man kan inte dra säker slutsats” (no reliable conclusion can be drawn). No mention of malignancy is made; instead, it emphasizes inconclusive findings and possible technical artefacts. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant. The statement neither gives nor implies any Gleason scores.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“andra halv kastas bort oanvänt”, “körning av prov görs i 8 steg”). Minor grammatical adjustments (e.g., “andra halvan kastas bort oanvänd”, “bearbetning av provet sker i åtta steg”) would improve clarity for a lay reader.
404	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatas systembiopsier” (systematic prostate biopsies) and gives the number (8 pieces) and approximate total length (~120 mm), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The report states that “man kan inte diagnostisera cancer definitivt” and the conclusion is “suspiciös fynd … lutande mot benign.” This indicates that malignancy has not been confirmed; the findings are suspicious but ultimately leaning benign. Therefore malignancy status is not definitively assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text, because no adenocarcinoma is diagnosed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., “stycker” should be “stycken,” “represetantiva” → “representativa,” “prostatavävnad” should probably be “prostatavävnad,” “immunfärgning proven” → “immunfärgning visar att i proven,” etc.). These do not render it incomprehensible, but they are noticeable.
405	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	10	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate samples) arriving in eight separate batches, which implies a prostate specimen type, but it never explicitly states whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.	: No  	: The statement only reports “normal basalvävnad” (normal basal tissue) in the preliminary examination and discusses technical issues with immunostaining panels. There is no mention of malignant or benign findings, nor any diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is present or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text mixes Swedish and Finnish in a somewhat awkward way (“bad kom”, “fästning av proven”, “Instituutin käyttämässä kokeellisessa immunologisten värjäysten paneeleissa”). While the intended meaning is understandable to a professional reader, the grammar is non-standard and could confuse a layperson. Minor corrections would improve clarity—for example, “kom i åtta separata batchar” (Swedish) or “tuli kahdeksassa erässä” (Finnish), and consistent language choice.
406	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	2	0	: Yes  	: The term “Prostatektomipreparat” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “invaderande tumörvävnad” and “malign växt”, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+3”, from which the sum (7) can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is understandable and uses standard histopathological terminology; no major grammatical or comprehension issues are present.
407	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	11	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “alla delar av prostata undersöks basis, apex och mitten medräknad”, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP). Therefore the information is only partial.  	: Partially  	: The statement describes “höggradiga PIN-förändringar” (high-grade PIN) and “varierande differentieringsklasser”, but it explicitly says that a reliable Gleason assessment could not be performed and that malignancy could not be confirmed. Thus malignancy status is left inconclusive rather than clearly benign or malignant.  	: No  	: The text states that “Delar av den vanligast Gleason bedömnings komponenter … grader 4 och 3, kan inte tillförlitlig studeras” and that only ~5 % of the material was examinable. No reliable major+minor=sum score is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical oddities (“prostatavävnad, som verkar att bilda rörliknande strukturer”, “Uppskastning som bes av höggradiga PIN-förändringar förblir blank som otillförlitlig”). These do not prevent comprehension for a lay reader, but polishing would improve clarity.
408	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Elektrosektionspånar” is a colloquial Swedish term for chips obtained by transurethral resection (TUR-P/TUR-B), so the sample type is clearly TUR material.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “fynd är benign” (findings are benign), so the absence of malignancy is directly asserted.  	: Not applicable  	: Because the findings are reported as benign, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The sentence structure is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“histologiskt undervisning” should probably be “histologisk undersökning” or “histologisk granskning”). The intended meaning is clear to a lay reader, but a minor grammatical correction would improve clarity.
409	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	12	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatacancer” and “provmaterial verkar vara från prostata”, which strongly implies the specimen is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: Partially  	: The phrase “tvivel av prostatacancer” indicates suspicion of prostate cancer, but it does not confirm malignancy; it only raises doubt. Therefore malignancy cannot be definitively assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern or score is provided, nor can any be inferred from the text.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish wording is awkward and contains grammatical errors (“det igångsatts i åtta stycken”, “vid histologiskt undervisning”). These make the sentence hard to understand even for a native speaker. A clearer version might be: “Mottaget prov består av vävnad med misstanke om prostatacancer och har sektionerats i åtta block. Vid histologisk undersökning verkar det mesta av provmaterialet härröra från prostata, men högre upplösta bilder väntar i kön hos digipatologen.”
410	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatas tjocknålbiopsier” (prostate core-needle biopsies) taken from “typiska ställer” (typical sites), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The text states “I prov B ser man carcinoma” (in specimen B carcinoma is seen), confirming a malignant finding.	: Yes  	: The Gleason grading is given directly as “Gleason grad 5 och total Gleason score 9 (4+5)”, which provides the major pattern (4), minor pattern (5), and sum (9).	: Minor mistakes  	: The message is understandable, but there are small grammatical/spelling issues: “längdt” should be “längd”, “som är redan” should be “som redan är”, and “förevarande ändring” is slightly awkward; “förekommande förändring” would be more idiomatic. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
411	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	13	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that samples (“prov”) have been taken from “typical places” and that the total volume is slightly larger on the right side than on the left. This implies that some form of prostate tissue sampling (likely biopsies) has been performed, but the exact sample type (biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated.  	: Partially  	: The statement indicates that in sample B “några anomali” (some anomalies) with a “differentieringmönster” (differentiation pattern) are found that are suspicious enough to warrant consultation with a colleague. This strongly suggests a possible malignancy, but the wording is deliberately cautious (“suspekt mönster”) and no outright diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully confirmed from the text alone.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is mentioned, nor is there any information from which a Gleason score could be inferred. The only descriptor is a vague “differentieringmönster” without numerical grading.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues: “typisk ställer” should probably be “typiska ställen”; “den höger sida” → “den högra sidan”; “differentieringmönster” → “differentieringsmönster”; “kolleg” → “kollega”; “suspekt mönster” → “suspekta mönster”; “normal mönster” → “normala mönster”; “atypisk inflammation” → “atypisk inflammation”. These errors do not render the text incomprehensible, but they are noticeable.
412	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes how it has been sliced and placed in cassettes, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “några tumör” (some tumours) are seen in the peripheral zone and close to the capsule, confirming the presence of malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason score is given: “Gleason 7-höjd carcinoma, varav större andel score 3 (ca. 60%)”. This implies a pattern distribution of 3 + 4 = 7 (since 60 % pattern 3 and the remainder pattern 4), but the exact major/minor breakdown is not spelled out, so the information is only partially complete.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “några tumör” should be “några tumörer”, “i den första snitten” should be “i de första snitten”). These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
413	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	14	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) and describes how the specimen is divided into cassettes, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The wording “omfattande översikt över patientens prostatavävnad” could suggest a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only inferred, not confirmed.	: No  	: The statement does not report any definitive malignant or benign findings. It only describes “särskild växtstrukturer periferalisk” (special growth structures peripherally) and mentions that a colleague compared the case to another patient who had Gleason 7, but no actual cancer diagnosis is given for this specimen. The phrase “uteslutas mid-gradus GG fynd” implies that intermediate-grade cancer has not been excluded, not that it has been found.	: Not applicable  	: No Gleason score is provided for the current specimen. The only mention of Gleason is in reference to a different patient (“en andra patient … fick en Gleason 7 gradering”), which cannot be used to infer the Gleason grade for this case.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains non-standard grammar and spelling (“igångsätta på kasetter”, “nesta veckans uromöte”, “jämförade”, “rekommenderade att göras”). These issues do not render it incomprehensible, yet they would benefit from correction for clarity, especially for a lay audience.
414	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Prostataspån med total vikt cirka 5g” clearly indicates that the material consists of prostate chips (TURP chips), so the sample type is identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “nästan alla har adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.	: Partially  	: The Gleason score is given as “Gleason 4 … med poängsum 8.” This implies a pattern 4+4=8, but the minor pattern is not explicitly stated, so the full major+minor=sum format cannot be definitively extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“undervisning med skop” should probably be “undersökning med skop,” “sin olika varianter” should be “sina olika varianter,” “poängsum” should be “poängsumma”). These minor grammatical issues do not prevent comprehension.
415	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	15	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatas vävnadmaterial” (prostate tissue material) and “biopsi” is not explicitly stated, but the context of scant tissue and urgent re-evaluation is typical for needle biopsies rather than TURP or prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can be inferred, yet it is not explicitly named.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that neither adenocarcinoma nor any Gleason pattern could be confirmed histopathologically at this stage. The only mention of malignancy is framed as clinical suspicion (“kliniska anteckningar nämnar tvekan av adenocarcinoma”), not as a verified histopathological finding. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed from the pathology report itself.	: No  	: Although the text quotes a possible “Gleason sum 8 / ISUP GG 4”, it immediately clarifies that this is based on clinical notes and not on the actual histopathological examination. No primary or secondary Gleason patterns are provided from the tissue, so the required major+minor=sum format cannot be extracted.	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish wording is awkward and contains grammatical errors (“vävnadmaterial igångsatts”, “nesta histologisk undervisningsession”, “representativ Gleason eller andra marker kunde inte bekräftas just nu”). These errors hinder clarity and would be difficult for a layperson to understand.
416	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “fusiobiopsier” (fusion biopsies), clearly identifying the sample type as needle biopsies obtained under MRI-guidance.	: Yes  	: The text describes “carcinomafokus” (carcinoma foci) and mentions “grad 3 växt” and “Gleason 4 looping strukturer,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.	: Partially  	: The report gives architectural proportions (≈2/3 pattern 3 and ≈1/3 pattern 4) and states “score 7 totalt,” which implies a Gleason sum of 7. However, the exact major+minor pattern notation (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+3=7) is not explicitly provided; one must infer that pattern 3 predominates, suggesting 3+4=7, but this is not stated outright.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues: “långdt” should be “längd,” “carcinomafokus” should be “carcinomafoci” or “carcinomafokus (plural),” and “Fynd score 7 totalt 15mm” is awkwardly phrased. A clearer wording would be “Gleasonsumma 7 (3+4) över en total cancerlängd av 15 mm.”
417	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	16	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostata” and “suspekt fokus”, which clearly points to prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a more specific label.	: Partially  	: The text repeatedly refers to “suspekt fokus” and “varierande nivåer av cellers differentiering grader”, implying that malignant (adenocarcinoma) foci are present. However, it never explicitly confirms “adenocarcinoma” or “malignant”, so the malignancy status is strongly suggested but not definitively stated.	: No  	: Although the author speculates about possible mid-grade patterns (e.g., “3+4 eller 4+3”), they explicitly say it was “omöjlig att bestämma precis score” because of resolution problems in the digitised images. Thus, no actual Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or can be reliably inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues: inconsistent plural forms (“nivåer av cellers differentiering grader”), awkward phrasing (“provinnehålls gradering borde göra manualisk på glas”), and missing prepositions. A clearer version might read: “Det undersökta materialet består av flera misstänkta foci i prostata. Cirka hälften av vävnaden analyserades digitalt, men på grund av upplösningsproblem kunde ingen exakt Gleason-grad anges.”
418	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard macroscopic handling of such a specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “man ser flera klar fokus … med dominerande Gleason klass 4 och också någon med klass 3”, confirming malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  	: Partially  	: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 4 and a minor component as Gleason 3, so the major+minor pattern can be inferred as 4+3. However, no explicit sum (Gleason score) is stated, so the complete “major+minor=sum” format is only partially assessable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains several non-standard grammatical constructions and spelling issues (e.g. “Prostatektomipreparat igångsatts”, “båda sidar”, “dominerande Gleason klass 4”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but standard phrasing would improve clarity.
419	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	17	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata” and describes multiple tissue blocks (A–D, E–F, G–N, N–O) taken from base to apex, strongly implying a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The statement discusses “differentieringsgrader för Gleason intervall 3 till 5” and whether malignant tissue is present, but it never confirms the actual finding (malignant vs benign). It only says that Gleason grades 3–5 “kan antagligen uppskattas” and that the material might be “helt normal.” Thus, malignancy status remains undetermined.	: No  	: Although Gleason grades 3–5 are mentioned as a possible range, no specific major + minor = sum pattern is provided or can be reliably inferred. The text explicitly states that the assessment is pending and will be completed later.	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “Förberett prov behandlas,” “vävnadobjekter,” “kapselns ogenomträngligheten,” “tillsatsen av den här rapport”). These issues hinder clarity and would be difficult for a layperson to understand.
420	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement mentions “spånor” (chips) obtained from “hyvling” (shaving), which in clinical practice corresponds to TUR-P/TUR-B (transurethral resection) chips. Thus the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “man ser carcinoma” (carcinoma is seen) and describes architectural patterns typical of prostate adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy is confirmed.	: Partially  	: A Gleason sum of 7 is given, and the relative proportions of pattern 3 (60 %) and pattern 4 (implied 40 %) are provided. However, the exact major + minor pattern notation (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7 or 4 + 3 = 7) is not explicitly stated, so the full Gleason score in the requested format cannot be unambiguously extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical oddities (e.g., “var igångsatt i 12 vävnadblock” should be “lades in i 12 vävnadskassetter” or similar). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a native speaker would notice the awkward phrasing.
421	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	18	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “standard prostataförfarande” and “tolv vävnadsbitar” (twelve tissue pieces), which strongly implies a 12-core needle-biopsy set. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly named, so assessment is only partial.	: Partially  	: The text explicitly raises the possibility of “en liten del av ISUP GG 1 eller högre” (a small component of ISUP Grade Group 1 or higher) but simultaneously states that the suspicious focus is “för liten för säker klassification” (too small for secure classification). Thus malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out; the finding is equivocal.	: No  	: Although ISUP Grade Group 1 is mentioned (which corresponds approximately to Gleason 3+3=6), no actual Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, and the pathologist explicitly declines to assign a grade because the focus is too small. Therefore the required Gleason format cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“perusteltua?”—a Finnish word dropped into Swedish text—and “liten område”). Minor grammatical adjustments (e.g., “litet område sticker ut”, “är motiverad”, “innehålla en liten del av ISUP GG 1”) would improve clarity for a lay reader.
422	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies) taken from different sides and typical locations, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The statement reports “adenocarcinoma” in one of the biopsy cores (prov 4), confirming a malignant finding. The other cores are described as benign (“frisk prostatavävnad”), so malignancy status is assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern distribution is given: approximately 90 % Gleason 3 and 10 % Gleason 4. This translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is understandable and uses standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic oddities (e.g., “olika sidor av typiskt ställen”) do not impede comprehension.
423	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	19	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatas vävnadproven” (prostate tissue samples) and that they were handled “enligt normal rutin för provtyp”, which implies a standard specimen type, but it never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be partially assessed.  	: Partially  	: The text describes “frisk benign prostatavävnad” in samples 2 and 3, and in sample 4 it notes “cellarkitekturer … som avvikar från normal prostatavävnad” and raises the possibility of malignancy. However, the final wording is deliberately inconclusive (“kvalitetssäkring ifrågasätter … möjligen malign”). Thus we can infer that malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, so the malignancy status is only partially assessable.  	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable overall, but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Som prov prostatas vävnadproven”, “gränsfallsmängd av liten till tillräcklig material”, “innan gås framåt”). These are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible, but they could be improved for clarity.
424	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiresekat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes macroscopic and microscopic sections taken from it, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that sections from both apex and base contain “adenocarcinoma,” confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are provided for both locations: apex is “Gleason 3+4 klass” (3+4=7) and base is “klass 4+4” (4+4=8). These are valid and complete Gleason patterns.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “prostatektomiresekat som prov,” “klass” instead of “klassificeras som”). A layman could grasp the key information, and the medical terminology is used correctly.
425	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	20	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that “prostatavävnads prov … delas till sex huvuduppsättningar” (prostate-tissue samples divided into six main sets), which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the wording is vague and does not explicitly state the sample type, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The text repeatedly stresses that evaluation of potential adenocarcinoma is impossible (“omöjlig”) because the tissue has been altered by prior interventions. It explicitly states that even if a low-grade Gleason pattern were hypothetically found, it would not change management. Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign finding is provided.	: No  	: Although a hypothetical Gleason score “3+4” is mentioned, it is presented as a purely speculative example (“hypotetisk situation”) rather than an actual diagnosis. No concrete Gleason pattern is assigned to the examined tissue, so the score cannot be assessed.	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish text is grammatically awkward and contains numerous non-standard constructions (“komplementät sjukdomar”, “påkallad interventioner”, “lokala vården”, “patientens helhetsbild låtar”). These errors obscure the intended meaning and would likely confuse a lay reader.
426	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Prostataspån” (prostate chips/shavings) and the weight given (≈19 g) clearly indicate that the specimen is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly describes malignant features: “illa differentierad växt” (poorly differentiated growth), enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and states that “cirka halva av spåns yte är tumörvävnad” (about half of the chip surface is tumour tissue).  	: Yes  	: The text gives “Gleason grad är mestadels 5 och näst mest 4”, which translates to Gleason pattern 5 as the dominant (major) grade and pattern 4 as the secondary (minor) grade. Thus the score can be inferred as 5+4=9.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is slightly informal (“var Gleason grad”) but is fully understandable to a clinician or informed lay reader; no corrections are necessary.
427	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	21	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatamaterial” and “fragment 3/5 g”, which implies prostate tissue fragments, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  	: No  	: The statement describes “mattaliknande växt” (carpet-like growth) and “cellkärnor har förtonas sig” (nuclei have faded), yet it explicitly says that technical background noise prevents evaluation of differentiation grades. There is no clear declaration of malignancy or benignity, only that assessment is hindered.  	: No  	: Because malignancy itself cannot be confirmed, no Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable from the text.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains numerous grammatical and orthographic errors (“ovh håller” for “och håller”, “förtonas sig” likely intended as “förtonat sig”, “mattaliknande” should probably be “matta-liknande” or “mattliknande”, “mikroskop” missing preposition, etc.). These mistakes significantly hinder readability for a layperson and suggest the text was poorly edited or automatically translated.
428	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatas tjocknålbiopsier” (core-needle biopsies of the prostate), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states that “låg differentierande carcinomavävnad” (poorly differentiated carcinoma tissue) is present in the left-sided fragments, and it further specifies “tumörväxt kring nerver” (perineural invasion). These phrases unequivocally indicate malignant findings. The right-sided fragments are described as having “ingen malignitet” (no malignancy), which is also a clear assessment.	: Partially  	: The Gleason pattern distribution is given as “mestadels 3 och näst mest 4” (mostly pattern 3 and second-mostly pattern 4). From this we can reasonably infer a major pattern of 3 and a minor pattern of 4, yielding a sum of 7 (3+4=7). However, the exact wording does not explicitly state “Gleason 3+4=7”, so the information is inferable but not fully explicit.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and vocabulary are standard medical Swedish and should be understandable to a lay reader with minimal medical background. No significant errors or ambiguities are present.
429	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	22	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatas vävnadprov” (prostate tissue sample) and refers to “materialen från vänster” and “höger”, which implies a biopsy set (left and right cores). However, it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement describes “kronisk inflammation” and an “ovanligt vid skala av cellers differentieringtyper”, but it does not confirm the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Instead, it explicitly says that assigning a Gleason grade would be “exceptionellt svår”, implying that malignancy has not been established. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The text explicitly states that determining a Gleason grade for the observed wide spectrum of differentiation is “exceptionellt svår” and refrains from providing any Gleason pattern or score. Hence, no Gleason information can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues: “Burk av prostatas vävnadprov” should probably be “Burk med prostatavävnadsprov”; “fregmentering” is a misspelling of “fragmentering”; “materialen” should be “materialet”; “cellers differentieringtyper” is awkward and should be “cellers differentieringstyper”; “minsann” is colloquial and out of place in a pathology report. These issues do not render the text incomprehensible, but they are noticeable.
430	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “prostatektomipreparat” clearly indicates that the material is a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “adenocarcinoma förändring” (adenocarcinoma changes), confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The description gives the relative percentages of Gleason patterns 4 (60 %), 5 (≈30 %) and 3 (tertiary, minimal). From this one can reasonably infer a dominant pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, yielding Gleason 4+5=9. However, the exact major + minor = sum formulation is not spelled out, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical oddities (e.g. “Representerara” should be “Representerar”, “klass 5 … representerande av” should be “klass 5 … representerar”, “särdeles liten” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
431	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	23	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “provset” (specimen set) and “makrosektioner” (macro-sections), which implies a tissue sample, but it never explicitly states whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: Partially  	: The text refers to a “tidigare halvfärdig rapport” that had mentioned “Gleason grad 3 fynd,” indicating that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma was previously reported. However, the current summary explicitly says the findings are doubtful and need re-evaluation, so the malignancy status is not confirmed in this statement itself.	: No  	: The only Gleason information provided is “Gleason grad 3,” which lacks both major and minor pattern scores and therefore cannot be expressed in the required major+minor=sum format.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical errors (e.g., “tags” should be “tagits,” “koncentreras på apex” should be “koncentreras på apexen,” “så att kan valideras” should be “så att det kan valideras”). These issues do not render the text incomprehensible but are noticeable.
432	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “turp-spån” (TURP chips), so the sample type is clearly identified as transurethral resection of the prostate material.  	: Yes  	: The statement describes “Gleason 4-klass tumörväxt” and concludes with “adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason score of 8 is given (“Poängsum uppdaterar till 8”), but only the total sum is provided; the individual major and minor pattern numbers (e.g., 4+4=8) are not explicitly stated, so the full major+minor=sum format cannot be directly verified.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains grammatical oddities such as “halvt igångsatts,” “vävnadkassett,” and “Poängsum uppdaterar.” These do not prevent comprehension but could be improved for clarity (e.g., “halva mängden inkapslades i sex vävnadskassetter,” “poängsumman uppdateras”).
433	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	24	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsier, radikal prostatektomis eller hyvlingar” (biopsies, radical prostatectomies or TURP specimens), so the sample types are clearly stated.  	: Partially  	: The text indicates that the original diagnosis was benign, but in about 25 % of cases the material was re-classified to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4 after review. Thus, malignancy status is mixed: some cases remained benign, others became malignant. The statement does not allow us to determine the final status for any individual sample.  	: Partially  	: Gleason scores (3+3 and 3+4) are explicitly given, but only as examples of the re-classified cases. Because the statement does not provide a specific Gleason score for any single specimen, we cannot extract a definitive major+minor=sum for a particular case.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The grammar is understandable but contains several non-standard constructions (e.g., “Prov består av flera av patienter”, “sen granskade”, “den här övnings avsikt”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but smoother phrasing would improve clarity.
434	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions three separate specimens (“Prov (1)”, “Prov (2)”, “Prov (3)”) and gives their lengths in millimetres, which clearly identifies the material as multiple tissue cylinders—i.e. prostate biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text concludes with “kontateras … adenocarcinoma” and describes tumour tissue in specimens 1 and 2, unequivocally establishing malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: Percentages of Gleason patterns 4 and 3 are provided for each positive core, but no explicit major + minor = sum format is given. From the data one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 (or 3 + 4 = 7) for both cores, yet the statement does not state this directly, so assessment is only partial.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable to a layman, but contains several spelling/grammar slips (“sådeles kontateras”, “differentiering”, “var finns ingen ovanlig prostatavävnad”). These do not impede comprehension but should be corrected for clarity.
435	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	25	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions three separate “prov” (samples) but never explicitly states whether they are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. The word “prov” is generic and could apply to any of these, so the exact sample type remains ambiguous.	: No  	: The conclusion explicitly says that “prostatas adenokarsinoma-fynd kan inte tillförlitlig bekräftas eller vederläggas” (adenocarcinoma findings cannot be reliably confirmed or refuted). Therefore the malignancy status is undetermined rather than benign or malignant.	: No  	: Although the text refers to “Gleason differentieringsmönster” in sample (1), it immediately states that evaluation is deferred to the next uro-meeting and no numeric Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or can be inferred.	: Major mistakes  	: The statement mixes Swedish and Finnish words/phrases (“suhteen???”, “uro-möte”) and contains grammatical errors (“mångfasetterad vävnadformer”, “icke-representativ cellmaterial”). The overall meaning can still be grasped, but the language quality is poor and would confuse a lay reader.
436	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard slicing and staining routine used for such specimens, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Partially  	: The text states that histological examination reveals “en rik tumör” (a rich tumor) extending from apex to base and mentions positive surgical margins in some apex sections. This confirms malignancy. However, it does not explicitly name the tumor as prostate adenocarcinoma, hence only partial clarity.  	: Partially  	: The dominant Gleason pattern is given as 3 and it is noted that “klass 4 differentiering finns nästan lika mycket.” This implies a pattern 4 component is present in roughly equal proportion, so the most reasonable inference is Gleason 3 + 4 = 7. Yet the exact minor pattern and the sum are not spelled out, so assessment is only partial.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (e.g., “rik tumör” instead of “omfattande tumör,” “klass 4 differentiering finns nästan lika mycket” instead of “Gleason-mönster 4 förekommer i ungefär lika stor utsträckning”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
437	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	26	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “undersökt material från prostata” and refers to apex and base portions, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.), so the information is only partial.	: Partially  	: A “möjlig Gleason summa 7” is mentioned, indicating a suspicion of malignancy, but the text immediately underlines that it is “oklart” whether this is confirmed. Thus malignancy is suggested but not definitively established.	: Partially  	: A “Gleason summa 7” is cited, but no primary (major) or secondary (minor) patterns are provided, nor is it clear whether the sum is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Therefore the full Gleason score in the required format cannot be reliably extracted.	: Major mistakes  	: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “behandlas enligt normal behandlingprocedurer och -markering”, “histologisk undervisning”, “summagråd 7”, “histopatologi kan inte tillförlitlig användas”). These issues hinder readability and would likely confuse a lay reader.
438	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “hyvlings-spånen” (shavings) is a clear reference to transurethral resection (TUR-P) chips, so the sample type is identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “Karcinoma hittas histologiskt” (carcinoma is found histologically), confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “Gleason 3+3=6”, providing major pattern 3, minor pattern 3, and sum 6.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; minor non-standard hyphenation (“hyvlings-spånen”) is acceptable in clinical notes.
439	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	27	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “vävnadmaterial från prostata” (tissue material from the prostate) and refers to batches, which implies a fragmented specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says that the growth pattern “inte följde normal prostatacancer differentiering” (did not follow normal prostate-cancer differentiation) and that any possible Gleason 3 would only be found “i små mängder” (in small amounts). This wording indicates that no clear malignant (adenocarcinoma) finding was confirmed; instead, the findings are described as atypical or borderline at most.  	: No  	: Although the phrase “diskutabelt Gleason grad 3” is used, it is immediately qualified as “i små mängder” and “inte följde normal … differentiering.” No major or minor Gleason pattern is assigned, and no sum score is provided or can be reliably inferred.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains several grammatical and lexical errors that obscure meaning: “tillsammans dussen gram” should probably be “tillsammans ett dussin gram” (a dozen grams); “igångsatts” is not standard Swedish; “nög och näppe” appears to be a misspelling of “noga och nätt och jämt” (barely). These issues make the text hard to follow even for a lay reader.
440	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “sex biopsicylindrar” (six biopsy cylinders), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The report describes two separate foci of “adenocarcinoma” and “carcinomavävnad” (carcinoma tissue), confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are provided for both malignant foci: 4+4=8 for focus 1 and 4+3=7 (with a clarifying note that the sum is 7) for focus 2. These are complete and valid Gleason classifications.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues (e.g., “gradus 4 andel ca. 70:30%” should probably be “Gleason grade 4 component approximately 70 %”). A layman could grasp the main points, but the phrasing could be smoother.
441	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	28	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “sex intressanta område” (six interesting areas) and refers to them as “undersökningsmaterial”, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can infer it is some form of prostate tissue, yet the exact sample type remains unspecified.	: No  	: While the text describes “atypiska växtmönster”, “konstiga växtstrukturer”, and “pre-malign förändringar”, it explicitly says “differentieringsgrad är oklar” and that material is being sent for further examination. No definitive malignant diagnosis is given; everything is framed as suspicious or inconclusive.	: No  	: Because no malignant diagnosis is confirmed, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or can be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains several grammatical issues: “sex intressanta område” should be “sex intressanta områden”; “Den intressant område” → “Det intressanta området”; “i framme på vänster” → “fram på vänster sida”; “RoI #3 … innehåler” → “innehåller”; “växtmönster” is acceptable but “växtstrukturer” is slightly awkward. These errors do not prevent comprehension but are noticeable.
442	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly describes the specimen as “fräschprov” (fresh specimen) and gives the weight of the prostate (≈40 g), indicating a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly reports “invasiv adenocarcinoma” in cassettes A and C, with additional malignant features such as capsular penetration and perineural invasion.  	: Partially  	: A Gleason score is provided (“Poängsum 7”), but only the total (7) is given. The major and minor pattern numbers (e.g., 4+3=7 or 3+4=7) are not separately stated; they can only be inferred from the description “mest klass 4 … mindre klass 3,” which suggests 4+3=7, but this is not explicitly written.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but contains a few spelling/typing errors (“häger lob” should be “höger lob,” “utställer” should probably be “upptäcks” or “visar,” “bäde” should be “både”). These do not prevent comprehension but are noticeable.
443	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	29	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “färsk prostatavävnadmaterial” (fresh prostate tissue material) and describes the sampling sites (left/right lower, middle, upper), which strongly implies that the material is prostate biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy cores, TURP chips, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly states that malignancy-related features such as capsular penetration, perineural invasion, and tumour differentiation could not be evaluated because specimens A and C were contaminated and not of prostatic origin. No statement is made about the presence or absence of carcinoma in the remaining specimens (B, D, E, F). Therefore, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The summary sentence “Det var inte möjlig att bestämma poängsumma” (It was not possible to determine a score) explicitly rules out any Gleason grading. No Gleason pattern information is provided or inferable.	: Major mistakes  	: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “vävnad som var inte från prostata”, “antydet”, “differengierinsgrader”, “reigångsattning”). These errors hinder readability and would confuse a lay reader. Corrections include: “vävnad som inte var från prostatan”, “antydde”, “differentieringsgrad”, and “re-undersökning efter ny provtagning”.
444	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	2	0	: Partially  	: The text mentions “vävnadsspånor tagna nära urotelcellerna” (tissue shavings taken close to urothelial cells), which implies a biopsy or TURP-like sampling, but no explicit term such as “biopsi”, “TURP” or “radikal prostatektomi” is used. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not stated with certainty.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly upgrades the diagnosis to “medelhög adenokarcinom” (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma) and assigns Grade Group 3, confirming malignancy.	: Yes  	: The updated Gleason pattern is given as “differentieringsgrad 4 (dominerande) och grad 3, med även tertiär grad 5”. Interpreting the dominant pattern as the primary grade (4) and the next most common as the secondary grade (3) yields 4+3=7, with tertiary 5 noted. This is sufficient to infer the standard Gleason score.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“medelhög adenokarcinom”, “vävnadsspånor”) and a few grammatical slips (“uppdateras patientens tidigare relativt osäkra diagnosis”). These do not impede comprehension but would benefit from minor polishing for clarity.
445	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	30	2	1	: No  	: The statement mentions “vävnad” (tissue) but never specifies whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be determined.  	: No  	: The text explicitly states that the atypical findings could neither be confirmed nor ruled out as malignant, and that the previous uncertain diagnosis “kunde inte bestämmas”. Hence the malignancy status remains undetermined.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a lay reader; only minor stylistic issues (e.g., “fyns” should be “fynd”, “åldersrelaterad förändringar” → “åldersrelaterade förändringar”) do not impede comprehension.
446	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “rutin mässigsystematisk biopsi” (systematic biopsy) and later “riktade biopsier” (targeted biopsies), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.  	: Yes  	: The statement describes malignant findings in both the initial biopsy (“minimalt fokus med 3+3=6 Gleason”) and the later targeted biopsy (“stort fokus … huvudsakligen tillväxtmönster 4 … näst vanligaste tillväxtmönster är 5”). These descriptions confirm adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: For the initial biopsy a clear Gleason score is given: 3+3=6. For the later targeted biopsy only the dominant pattern (4) and the secondary pattern (5) are mentioned, but no explicit sum is stated. Therefore the Gleason score for the most recent finding cannot be fully reconstructed from the text alone.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains several minor grammatical and spelling issues (e.g. “mässigsystematisk” should be “mässig systematisk”, “inlendingsvis” should be “inledningsvis”, “tillväxtmönster” should be “tillväxtmönstret” in places). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a light copy-edit would improve clarity.
447	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	31	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “nödvändiga prov” (necessary samples) were taken after imaging, which implies some kind of prostate tissue sampling (biopsy, TURP, etc.). However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The statement repeatedly uses the word “suspekta” (suspicious) findings, but explicitly says interpretation is difficult and further sampling is required. No malignant diagnosis is confirmed, nor is benign status asserted. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from this text.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains multiple grammatical and lexical errors (“suspekt symptomen”, “avblidning”, “missluckande”, “konstigheter i vävnad”, etc.) that obscure meaning. A lay reader would struggle to understand the intended message; significant revision is needed for clarity.
448	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen type, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The report confirms the presence of a multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma in the original prostatectomy specimen, so malignancy is clearly established.  	: Partially  	: Several Gleason patterns are listed (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3), but no single composite Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided for the overall tumour. Therefore the exact Gleason score cannot be fully inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable for a layman, although some medical terms (e.g., “seminalvehiklar”) may require brief explanation.
449	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	32	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “primär prostatavävnad” (primary prostate tissue) and “lymfkörtlar och seminalvesiklar” (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles), which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen. However, no explicit term such as “radikal prostatektomi” is used, so the sample type is only partially ascertainable.  	: No  	: The text speaks of “forskningsresultat skiljar sig mellan proven” (research results differ between the samples) and “makroskopisk sektioner från primär prostatavävnad träder i kraft” (macroscopic sections from primary prostate tissue take effect), but it never states whether malignant or benign histopathological findings were present. Absence of any mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or benign diagnosis means malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which such scores could be inferred.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains grammatical and lexical issues: “batchar” is an anglicism; “längst” should be “längsta”; “ställer” should be “ställen”; “skiljar” should be “skiljer”; “träder i kraft” is awkward in this context; and overall phrasing is unclear. These errors hinder easy comprehension even for a lay reader.
450	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Prostatektomipreparatet” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “Gleason typer 3+4/4+3” and “tumör har penetrat genom kapseln,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: Two Gleason patterns are given (3+4 and 4+3), but the statement does not specify which one is the primary (major) pattern for the index tumour, nor does it provide a single summed Gleason score. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be unambiguously extracted.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“igångsatts”, “kolla på mer precis ytterligare information från detalj”) and minor grammatical slips. A layman could grasp the gist, yet the wording could be clearer.
451	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	33	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “makrosnitt” (macroscopic sections) and “seminalvesiklar” (seminal vesicles), which implies the material is from a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Inga malign fynd i seminalvesiklar” (no malignant findings in seminal vesicles). It does not state whether prostate tissue itself was examined or whether any prostate carcinoma was found elsewhere. Therefore, malignancy status for the prostate cannot be determined.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores or any information from which Gleason grades could be inferred are provided.  	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish is awkward and contains grammatical errors (“Samlade prov preparerad” should be “Samlade prover preparerade”; “ligger i olika ställer” should be “ligger på olika ställen”; “Kolla på mer precis tilläggsinformation av rapport från detaljer” is unclear and ungrammatical). These issues hinder easy understanding, especially for a layperson.
452	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly indicates that the material is an “elektroresekat” (TURP – transurethral resection of the prostate), weighing 7.5 g and submitted in six cassettes. This unambiguously identifies the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that the findings are “inte förenligt med prosta adenokarcinoma” and that “inget malignt” is seen. Thus, malignancy status is clearly assessed as negative.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required. Therefore, Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains minor grammatical/spelling issues: “vilket preparerats” should be “varav preparerats”, “vävnadkassetter” should be “vävnadskassetter”, “varanda” should be “varandra”, “silformade” likely intends “sillformade” (adenosis-like slit-like structures), and “Man ses” should be “Man ser”. These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
453	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	34	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that 7 g of tissue were processed from a 7.5 g sample, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (e.g., biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The phrase “preparerats 7 g i sex vävnadkassetter” suggests six tissue cassettes, which is compatible with a TURP or multiple biopsies, yet the exact source remains unspecified.  	: No  	: The report describes cribriform growth and very closely packed glands, which are worrisome features. However, it explicitly states “Fynd tyder inte på prostatas” (findings do not indicate prostate cancer) and concludes with “hyperplastisk prostatavävnad med kronisk inflammation” (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). Thus, malignancy is explicitly ruled out rather than confirmed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is denied, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “prostatas” should probably be “prostataadenokarcinom” or “prostatacancer” for clarity, and “cribriform växt” would be more idiomatically “cribriform tillväxt”. These do not impede overall comprehension.
454	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “representativa biopsier från höger och vänster lob,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle biopsies from both lobes.  	: Yes  	: The phrase “Något karcinom kommer inte fram” explicitly states that no carcinoma (malignancy) is found. The mention of high-grade PIN is noted, but PIN itself is not considered invasive malignancy.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is standard medical language and easily understandable to professionals; lay readers might need brief clarification of terms like “PIN” or “hyperplasi,” but the overall grammar and clarity are appropriate.
455	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	35	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prov från vänster och höger lob” (samples from left and right lobe), which implies biopsies, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: No  	: The findings describe high-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and hyperplasia, both of which are non-malignant. There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignancy. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed as present.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings (adenocarcinoma) are reported, Gleason grading is not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is generally understandable, but the phrase “Upptäcks diverse fynd” is vague and slightly awkward in Swedish. A clearer phrasing would be “Diverse fynd observeras” or “Diverse fynd noteras.”
456	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement describes a large specimen weighing 80 g and measuring 7 × 6 × 5 cm, which is processed into multiple cassettes. These dimensions and weight are typical for a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimen.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states that “malignitet … kommer inte fram” (malignancy is not demonstrated), confirming the absence of malignant findings.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology. It is easily understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons.
457	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	36	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “8 makrokasetter och 5 vanliga kasetter,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore, the information is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The microscopic description reports only epithelial hyperplasia and explicitly states that malignancy “kunde inte bedömas tillförlitligt” (could not be reliably assessed). Thus, no malignant findings are confirmed, nor is benign status definitively established.	: Not applicable  	: Since no prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable for a professional reader. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “preparat typisk” could be “preparatets vikt och storlek är typiska”) do not impede comprehension.
458	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “elektrosektionsspånor” (TURP chips), so the type of specimen is unambiguous.  	: No  	: The description mentions only benign changes: nodular proliferated glandular tissue, mild inflammation, and hyperplasia. There is no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or any atypical features that would indicate cancer.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and uses standard histopathological terminology. It is readily understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons.
459	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	37	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) but does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, not the specific procedure.	: No  	: The statement reports only “prostatavävnad med delvis nodulart kortelkomponent” and “lindrig inflammation.” There is no mention of malignancy or adenocarcinoma; instead, it indicates that a more thorough examination is pending. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided or inferable from the text.	: Major mistakes  	: The Swedish contains grammatical and lexical issues that hinder clarity. “Mindre än hälften av det möjliga provmaterialet preparerat” is missing a verb (should be “har preparerats”). “kortelkomponent” appears to be a misspelling of “körtelkomponent” (glandular component). “Noggrannare undervisning” is likely intended to be “noggrannare undersökning” (more thorough examination). These errors make the text difficult to understand for a layperson.
460	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Representativa nålbiopsier undersöks” clearly states that the material consists of representative needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The sentence “Något malignsuspekt kommer inte fram” explicitly communicates that no malignant (or even suspicious) findings were detected; hence the findings are benign.	: No  	: Because no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading was performed or reported; therefore the Gleason score (major + minor = sum) cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and grammatically correct for a pathology report. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Biopsiernas totala längds” instead of “längd”) are acceptable within the domain and remain fully understandable.
461	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	38	2	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Representativa vävnadprov” (representative tissue samples) indicates that some form of tissue has been examined, but the exact sample type—biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy—is not specified.  	: No  	: The statement describes only “hyperplastisk prostatavävnad med kronisk inflammation” (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). No mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant finding is present, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not applicable and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is grammatically correct and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology suitable for a pathology report.
462	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes standard handling (macro-sections, embedding), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “tumör i tre foci” was found, confirming malignant findings.  	: Partially  	: The report gives both Gleason patterns 3 and 4 and states the sum is 7, but it does not explicitly state the major and minor pattern in the standard “3+4=7” or “4+3=7” format. One can reasonably infer that pattern 3 is the major (it is called “vanligaste”), yet the exact notation is missing.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard histopathological phrasing; minor stylistic issues (e.g., “igångsätts enlight” should be “enligt”) do not impede comprehension.
463	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	39	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that a specimen of size 20 (presumably mm) is examined and that sections are taken, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). The phrase “normal rutin” suggests a routine histological work-up, yet the exact origin of the tissue remains unspecified.  	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly writes that it is impossible to determine whether the findings represent benign hyperplasia or malignancy. Therefore, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be assessed from the statement.  	: No  	: The text clearly states that “Man kunde inte bestämmä Gleason score,” which directly negates any possibility of inferring a Gleason score (major + minor = sum).  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “bestämmä” should be “bestämma,” and “det är omöjligt att fastställa om det rör sig om benign hyperplasi eller någonting malign” would read more naturally as “det är omöjligt att avgöra om det rör sig om benign hyperplasi eller malignitet.” These errors do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
464	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “hyvling” (TURP – transurethral resection) and gives its weight and cassette distribution, so the sample type is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that no atypia or infiltrative epithelium is seen and concludes with “Godartad prostatahyperplasi” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Thus, malignancy status is clearly assessed as absent.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; minor domain-specific abbreviations (e.g., “ca” for “cirka”) are acceptable. No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
465	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	40	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that “8.9 g of material was processed in about 8 cassettes,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.  	: No  	: No malignant diagnosis is given; only “hyperplasia” and “inflammation” are mentioned, with the phrase “possibly something else” left deliberately vague. The final sentence explicitly says “further examination is required,” confirming that malignancy has neither been confirmed nor ruled out.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing such as “histologisk undervisning” (literally “histological teaching”) instead of “histologisk undersökning” (“histological examination”), and “nångonting andra” should be “någonting annat.” These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede overall comprehension.
466	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “systematic biopsier från höger och vänster lob”, which clearly identifies the sample type as systematic (trans-rectal) prostate biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The sentence “Ingen prostatacancer kommer inte fram i detta material” (literally “no prostate cancer is not found in this material”) conveys that no malignant findings were detected. Although the double negative is stylistically awkward, the intended meaning is unambiguous: the biopsies are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues: “representiva” should be “representativa”, “stillvis” is likely intended to be “ställvis” (occasionally), and the double negative “Ingen … kommer inte fram” is non-standard. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a polished version would read: “I proverna 1–6 föreligger representativa systematiska biopsier från höger och vänster lob. I prov 3 (vänster apex) ses lindrig kronisk inflammation. Även i proverna 1 och 2 på vänster sida noteras ett antal atrofiska körtlar samt lokal lindrig kronisk inflammation. Ingen prostatacancer påvisas i materialet.”
467	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	41	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions that samples were taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate, which implies a biopsy, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (e.g., biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy).  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says it is difficult to determine whether the samples contain cancer-related changes, meaning malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason scores are not provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	": The grammar is mostly understandable, but there are minor issues: ""En prov"" should be ""Ett prov"" (neuter gender), and ""atrofierad körtlar"" should be ""atrofierade körtlar"" (plural adjective agreement)."
468	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “Prostatektomipreparatet” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy sample, so the sample type is explicitly stated.  	: Yes  	: The text describes “Gleason 4 differentiering” and a “liten komponent av Gleason 3”, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly gives the Gleason score as “7 (4+3)”, providing major pattern 4, minor pattern 3, and sum 7.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable to a trained reader; minor stylistic issues (e.g., “Sammanfattningt” should be “Sammanfattningsvis”) do not impede comprehension.
469	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	42	2	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostataprov” clearly indicates a prostate specimen, but the exact type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not specified.  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Det kan dock inte bestämmas om fynd är cancer eller inflammation,” i.e., it cannot be determined whether the findings are cancer or inflammation. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but “cirka 8?” is incomplete (missing unit), and “en liten område” should be “ett litet område.”
470	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	43	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “ca 30 g prostataspån” (approximately 30 g of prostate chips) and that the material was placed in cassettes A–H, which clearly identifies the sample as TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The pathologist states that “något prostata adenocarcinom kommer inte fram i dette material” (no prostate adenocarcinoma is found in this material), thereby confirming that the findings are benign.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is standard histopathology terminology and is readily understandable to professionals and informed laypersons alike.
471	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	43	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “cirka 30 g prostataprov” (≈30 g prostate specimen) and that the material was placed in cassettes and a jar, which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) or similar resection specimen. However, the exact sample type is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “man kan inte dra slutsats av cancerrelaterad förändringar” (no conclusion about cancer-related changes can be drawn). Therefore, malignancy status cannot be assessed from the text.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant finding is reported, Gleason grading is irrelevant and cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “burken” should probably be “burk” (singular), and “Ses mest vanlig prostatavävnad” would read more naturally as “Ses mestadels vanlig prostatavävnad” or “Ses mest vanlig prostatavävnad.” These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
472	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The text states that “nu hittas alltså ingen tumörvävnad” (no tumour tissue is now found) and that only benign changes (atrophy, chronic inflammation) are present. Therefore malignancy status is assessable and the finding is benign.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant tissue is identified in the current biopsies, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable; Gleason scores are only relevant when adenocarcinoma is present.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is clear, concise and easily understandable even to a layman; only minor colloquial phrasing (“ju”) is used, which is acceptable in clinical notes.
473	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	44	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “representativa prostataprov” (representative prostate samples) and refers to “tidigare biopsier” (previous biopsies), which implies the current material is also biopsies. However, it does not explicitly state the sample type for the current examination, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Man kan dra ingen slutsats av malign förändringar” (no conclusion can be drawn regarding malignant changes). Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed from this report alone.	: No  	: Since malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “rapporterarades” (should be “rapporterades”) and slightly awkward phrasing like “Man kan dra ingen slutsats av malign förändringar” (more natural: “Inga slutsatser kan dras angående maligna förändringar”).
474	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “total prostatektomipreparat” (total prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text describes a “sammanflytande tumorvävnads fokus” (confluent tumour tissue focus) and assigns Gleason pattern “klasser 3+4”, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The phrase “klasser 3+4” directly gives the major and minor Gleason patterns, and their sum is 7. Thus Gleason 3+4=7 can be inferred unambiguously.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “klasser 3+4” instead of “Gleason 3+4”). A lay reader can grasp the key facts without difficulty.
475	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	45	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and describes processing “enligt rutin” (according to routine), but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The reference to “kapsel hel” (capsule intact) and “områdes lymfkörtlar” (regional lymph nodes) hints at a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only an inference, not a clear statement.	: Partially  	: The report describes a “sammanflytande vävnadfokus” with glandular structures that are “svår att tolka” and “struktur oklar”. While the findings are called “suspekt” (suspicious), no definitive diagnosis of malignancy is given. The possibility of cancer is raised but not confirmed, so malignancy status remains uncertain.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can any Gleason information be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “materialet av mitten” should probably be “materialet från mitten”; “i fokus mest av körtelstrukturer” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but polishing would improve clarity.
476	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “hyvlingsprostataspån” (literally “shavings of prostate chips”) clearly indicates that the specimen is a TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly says “Ingen prostatacancer kommer inte fram” (double negative, but the intended meaning is “no prostate cancer is found”). Thus malignancy status can be assessed as negative/benign.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but it contains a double negative (“Ingen … inte”) and a slightly awkward phrase “i gång en mindre del av materialet”. A clearer wording would be “en mindre del av materialet bearbetas” or similar.
477	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	46	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatamaterial” and describes its handling (“sätts i kasetter”), which implies it is some form of prostate tissue specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.  	: No  	: The pathologist explicitly writes “Kunde inte bestämmas finns det cancerrelaterad förändringar” (“It could not be determined whether cancer-related changes are present”). This means malignancy status is undetermined, so we cannot assess whether malignant findings are present.  	: No  	: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical issues: “en mindre del av materialet igång” is awkward (likely meant “en mindre del av materialet används” or similar); “kunde inte bestämmas finns det” should be “kunde det inte bestämmas om det finns”. These are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
478	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	2	0	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions “tre stycken biopsier från höger och tre stycken från vänster,” which clearly identifies the material as needle biopsies from both sides of the prostate.	: Yes	: The text states “Några maligna förändringar hittas inte från vänster eller höger sidan,” confirming that no malignant findings were present; the only findings are benign (normal epithelium and mild chronic inflammation).	: Not applicable	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores can be assessed.	: Appropriate	: The statement is written in clear, understandable Swedish with only a minor spelling inconsistency (“stycker” instead of “stycken”). The overall meaning is easily grasped by a lay reader.
479	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	47	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “undersöks materialet från höger och vänster” and gives a total length, which implies that the material consists of paired biopsies (right and left). However, the exact sample type (e.g., needle biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.	: No  	: The text explicitly says “Kan inte bestämmas om det finns malign fynd på vänster eller höger,” meaning malignancy cannot be determined. Therefore, the malignancy status is not assessable.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Hence, Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is clear and understandable; the phrasing is typical for a pathology report. No significant grammatical errors or comprehension issues are present.
480	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a prostate resection (“resekat”) and describes the preparation of tissue blocks from apex, mid-gland, base and seminal vesicles, which is typical for a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that adenocarcinoma is found in the base of the prostate, with capsular invasion and perineural growth, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The report gives the most common and second-most common Gleason patterns for each tumour focus:  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and professional, using standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “nästvanligaste”) are acceptable within the domain and do not hinder understanding.
481	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	48	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostatamaterial erhållet från flera obduktioner” and describes preparation into apex, mid-part, base and seminal vesicles, which clearly points to radical-prostatectomy-like specimens. However, the material is explicitly from autopsies used for teaching, not from a clinical patient, so the sample type is only partially assessable in a clinical sense.	: No  	: The text states that “differentierings förändringar kan inte särskiljas på individnivå” and that the findings are “intressanta trender” for teaching purposes only. No individual malignant diagnosis is given; the summary explicitly says the material is not used to draw conclusions about differentiation grades. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: The summary explicitly says “på grund av den demonstrations karaktären används dessa inte för att dra slutsatser på differentieringsgrader (t.ex. Gleason 1-5)”, so no Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “två områder” (should be “områden”), “Differentierings förändringar” (should be “Differentieringsförändringar”), and “demonstrations karaktären” (should be “demonstrationskaraktären”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
482	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	2	0	: Yes  	: The phrase “hyvligns-spånen från prostata” clearly indicates trans-urethral resection (TURP) chips, so the sample type is identifiable.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “carcinom i 5 spånor”, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Partially  	: The statement gives the most common Gleason grade as 3 and the second most common as 4, from which one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. However, it does not explicitly state the score in the standard “major + minor = sum” format, so the information is only partially complete.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable, but “hyvligns-spånen” should be written as “hyvelspånen” (correct Swedish spelling).
483	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	49	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and that it is examined on 8 slides, which implies a histopathology specimen. However, it does not explicitly state the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The statement indicates that “några förändring” (some changes) are present in the fifth slide that require further investigation, but it explicitly states that no conclusion can be drawn due to technical limitations. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no conclusion about malignancy can be drawn, Gleason grading is not applicable in this context.	: Minor mistakes  	: The grammar is generally understandable, but there are minor issues: “förändring” should be plural (“förändringar”), and “kan inte dras slutsats” is missing a subject (“en slutsats kan inte dras”). These do not severely impede comprehension but could be improved for clarity.
484	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “nålbiopsier” (needle biopsies), which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported in the right-sided biopsies: Gleason 3+4 and Gleason 3+3 are both stated, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The left-sided biopsies are explicitly described as benign.  	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are given directly as 3+4 and 3+3, from which the sums (7 and 6) can be inferred. Additional architectural details are provided, but the essential major + minor = sum format is already present.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable, using standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “cirka 60 % Gleason 3”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
485	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	50	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “glas 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B”, which strongly implies that the material is glass-mounted biopsy cores. However, the exact sample type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly says “fynd är inte definierbart” (the findings are not definable) and repeatedly uses the word “bara” (only) when describing the tissue. No malignant diagnosis is given; instead, the tissue is described as benign or insufficient. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Hence Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g. “konstateras några förändringar” should probably be “konstateras det några förändringar” or “konstateras förändringar”; “hittas” is colloquial for “hittades”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
486	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomipreparat,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “Adenikarcinom finns i båda loberna,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The dominant Gleason grade is given as 4 and the secondary grade as 5, but no explicit sum (e.g., 4+5=9) is provided. From the wording one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 9 (4+5), yet it is not stated outright, so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “huvudakligen” instead of “huvudsakligen”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
487	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	51	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “Prov prepareras till kasetter” (specimen prepared into cassettes), which implies a tissue sample, but it never explicitly states whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: Partially  	: The description “Huvudaklige invaderar och bildar separata och variabelt formade körtelkanaler, som går över varandra” strongly suggests malignant prostate adenocarcinoma. However, the sentence “På grund av förorening, karaktär av förändringar obestämd” introduces uncertainty, so malignancy cannot be stated with full certainty.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can any pattern be reliably inferred from the wording. The phrase “några förändringar i båda lobet, cirka 20% av hela ytan” gives an approximate tumour extent but no Gleason grading.	: Major mistakes  	: The text contains numerous grammatical and lexical errors (e.g., “Utorel förstört”, “Huvudaklige”, “nägra fynd i några ställer”, “karaktär av förändringar obestämd”) that hinder clear understanding. A layman would struggle to grasp the intended meaning without domain knowledge.
488	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “spån från prostatahyvling” (chips from prostate resection), which clearly identifies the sample as TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  	: Yes  	: The text states that “det finns litet suspicion” and describes “fusionerande kribriforma körtlar” and “skillt stående körtlar” with both Gleason 3 and 4 differentiation, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: Gleason patterns 3 and 4 are mentioned, but no explicit major+minor=sum triplet is given. One can infer a likely Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+3=7), yet the exact breakdown is not stated.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable despite a few spelling/grammatical errors (“efter” misspelled as “efer”, “gångsätts” likely meant “inkapslas”, “skillt” should be “skilt”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
489	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	52	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that the material was taken after fixation, indicating the sample type is prostate tissue. While it does not specify biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, the term “prostataprov” is sufficient to identify the sample type as prostate tissue.  	: Partially  	: The statement describes “misstänksam fynd” (suspicious findings) including “fusionerande cribriforma körtlar” (fused cribriform glands) and “skillt stående körtlar” (separate standing glands), which are concerning for malignancy. However, the final characterization is “obestämd på grund av skämd prov” (undetermined due to poor sample quality), meaning malignancy cannot be definitively confirmed or ruled out.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided or can be inferred from the description. The findings are described as suspicious but inconclusive due to poor sample quality, and no grading is mentioned.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The grammar is generally understandable, but there are minor issues: “ficks” should likely be “fick” (received), “cirka 10.5” lacks units (likely cm), and “skillt stående körtlar” is slightly awkward phrasing. These do not severely impede comprehension but could be clearer.
490	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “10 biopsier och små vävnadsfragment”, clearly identifying the material as needle biopsies.	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally reports “cancer” in five of the biopsies, along with adverse features such as perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension (“växt av carcinomvävnad i fettvävnad”).	: Partially  	: Gleason scores are provided for individual foci (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3 in one biopsy, sum 7; Gleason 4 only in others, sum 8), but the overall case-level Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is not explicitly stated. One can infer that the highest-grade focus is Gleason 4+4=8, yet the exact major/minor breakdown for the entire specimen is missing.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but contains a typo (“untanför” instead of “utanför”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“resterande delen är Gleason 3 (poängsum 7)” and “resultat är sum 8”). These do not impede comprehension but could be polished for clarity.
491	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	53	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “flera prov och små vävnadsfragment” (several specimens and small tissue fragments), which implies that the material consists of biopsy fragments. However, the exact sample type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  	: No  	: While the text refers to “strukturförändringar” (structural changes) and “perineural” and “till fettvävnad” (perineural invasion and extension into adipose tissue), these phrases are too vague and the sentence is truncated. Crucially, the report concludes that the specimens are “skämd” (damaged/spoiled) and that “fynd kan inte analyseras” (findings cannot be analysed). Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign status can be extracted.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy cannot be assessed at all, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) can be provided.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish wording is understandable to a professional reader, but the sentence structure is fragmented and lacks punctuation, making it slightly awkward. A clearer phrasing would be: “Flera prov och små vävnadsfragment. Strukturförändringar ses främst i vänster lob med perineural invasion och utbredning till fettvävnad. Proven är skämda; fynden kan inte analyseras.”
492	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “Mikroskopiskt ses tumorvävnaden i båda sidor” and describes adenocarcinoma, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Dominerande differentiering klass 4, mindre del av klass 3,” which translates to Gleason grade 4 as the dominant pattern and grade 3 as the minor pattern. Thus the Gleason score can be inferred as 4+3=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable for a professional reader; minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “klass” instead of “grade”) is acceptable in the domain.
493	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	54	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly describes the specimen as a radical prostatectomy (apex-to-base serial sections, seminal vesicles included), so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Partially  	: Suspicious changes are described bilaterally with invasive growth and capsular penetration, strongly implying malignancy. However, the phrase “omöjlig att bestämma förändringarna” (impossible to determine the changes) introduces uncertainty, preventing a definitive malignant classification.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “makrosnitten” should be “makrosnitt”, “bildar sammanflytande körtelkanaler” could be clearer as “bildar sammanflytande körtelstrukturer”). Overall, the intended meaning is clear to a lay reader.
494	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “hyvlingsmaterial” (TURP chips), and the weight and cassette information confirm it is a transurethral resection specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “största delen är dåligt differentierad prostatakancer” (the majority is poorly differentiated prostate cancer), so malignancy is unequivocally present.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given as “Gleason 5, med en liten komponent av Gleason 4.” Interpreting the dominant pattern as 5 and the minor pattern as 4 yields a sum of 9, i.e., 5+4=9.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear, concise, and uses standard histopathological terminology. A layman might need a brief explanation of “hyvlingsmaterial” and “Gleason,” but the statement itself is grammatically correct and easily understandable.
495	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	55	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “5.7” and “4 gram” and “8 kasetter”, which strongly suggests a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but it never explicitly names the sample type. Therefore the type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  	: No  	: The phrase “några suspekt förändringar” indicates that suspicious changes are present, but no definitive malignant diagnosis is given. Without confirmation of carcinoma, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can any be inferred from the text.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical slips: “Hela provmaterial” should be “Hela provmaterialet”, “hittas” should be “hittades” (past tense), and “ses också atrofierade körtlar” would read more naturally as “ses också atrofierade körtlar”. These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
496	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “systembiopsier” (systematic biopsies) and gives the lengths of six cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “karcinom” (carcinoma) is found in biopsies 1–3 from the left side, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The summary provides the Gleason score directly: “Poängsum 3+3=6”, which is the required major + minor = sum format.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains a few spelling/typing errors (“karcinon” should be “karcinom”, “kancern” should be “cancer”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
497	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	56	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “provpreparat” (specimen preparation) and describes prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can only infer that it is some form of prostate tissue specimen.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Kan inte bestämmas på grund av provkvalitet” (cannot be determined due to specimen quality). Therefore, malignancy status is not assessable.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “ses mycket i stroma” could be “ses i stromat i stor utsträckning”) do not impede comprehension.
498	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are reported: a tumour focus is located in the right apex, and Gleason grades 3 and 4 are assigned to the cancerous tissue.  	: Partially  	: The text gives the major pattern (Gleason 3, 70 %) and the minor pattern (Gleason 4, 5–10 %), but no explicit sum is provided. The tertiary pattern 5 is 1 % and does not affect the sum. One can reasonably infer a score of 3+4=7, yet the statement does not state the sum outright.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor non-standard phrasing (“en helt del”, “praktiskt oansenlig”) that does not impede comprehension.
499	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	57	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “provpreparat” (specimen preparation) and describes prostate tissue, implying a prostate sample, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Kan inte bestämmas på grund av provkvalitet” (cannot be determined due to specimen quality). Therefore, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Because malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable, but “Provpreparat igångsatts” is awkward; “Provpreparat påbörjades” or “Provpreparat framställdes” would be clearer. “Formerad sammanflytande körtlar” is also non-standard; “bildar sammanflytande körtlar” or “visar sammanflytande körtelbildning” would read better.
500	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates the sample type is TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  	: Yes  	: The text states “histologiskt ses … prostatacancer” and describes tumor tissue occupying about 40 % of the material, confirming a malignant finding.  	: Partially  	: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 3 (50 %) and the secondary pattern as Gleason 4 (~20 %). From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. However, the exact percentages for the minor pattern are approximate (“cirka 20 %”) and the wording “näst vanligaste komponent klass 4” is slightly informal, so the score is inferable but not stated in the canonical “major+minor=sum” format.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is clear and understandable; only minor colloquial phrasing (“klass 4 andel”) is used, which is acceptable in routine pathology reports.
501	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	58	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that it has been processed into three cassettes, which implies a tissue sample from the prostate. However, it does not explicitly state whether the sample is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.  	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Kan inte bestämmas fynd” (findings cannot be determined). While chronic inflammation and atrophic acinar structures are mentioned, these are benign changes and do not confirm or rule out malignancy. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: No  	: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The grammar is generally understandable, but there are minor issues: “Gram av prostataprov” is awkward (should be “Gram av prostatamaterial” or similar), and “några atrofierad acinus strukturer” should be “några atrofierade acinusstrukturer.” These do not hinder comprehension significantly.
502	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “repsentativa biopsier” (representative biopsies) from right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: It states that “från vänster lob ses ett litet fokus med cancer” and later “Carcinom finns totalt på 10 mm längd”, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Partially  	: The text gives only the major pattern (“enbart Gleason 3 differentiering”), implying a Gleason score of 3 + X = 3 + ?. Because the minor pattern is not specified, the complete major+minor=sum format cannot be fully reconstructed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The statement is understandable but contains a typo (“repsentativa” should be “representativa”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“kommer ingen tumörvävnad fram”). These are minor issues and do not impede comprehension.
503	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	59	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prov 1 och 2 från höger och vänster lob” (Samples 1 and 2 from right and left lob), which clearly indicates that the material consists of prostate biopsies.  	: Partially  	: A “liten fokus av förändringar” (small focus of changes) is described, with cribriform growth pattern noted, but the report explicitly states that differentiation (i.e., malignancy) “kan inte skiljas” (cannot be determined). Therefore malignancy status is left inconclusive rather than confirmed benign or malignant.  	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the text explicitly says differentiation cannot be assessed, so no valid inference of Gleason score is possible.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical oddities (e.g., “andra prov förkroppsligar inte cancervävnad” is non-standard; “förkroppsligar” is usually “innehåller” or “visar”). The overall meaning is clear to a lay reader, but a native speaker would phrase some parts differently.
504	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomiopererad preparatet” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and gives its dimensions and weight, so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “karcinom” (carcinoma) is observed in both lobes anteriorly and that these changes represent “prostatakarcinom” (prostate carcinoma). Thus, malignancy is confirmed.  	: Partially  	: The statement indicates that the carcinoma is “till största delen bestående av Gleason typ 4, men ca 10% av vävnaden är av Gleason typ 5.” From this we can infer a dominant pattern 4 and a minor pattern 5, giving a Gleason score of 4+5=9. However, the exact wording does not explicitly state “Gleason score 4+5=9,” so the assessment is only partial.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “repsenterar” instead of “representerar”). A lay reader could grasp the essential information with little difficulty.
505	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	60	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “provpreparat” (specimen) and lists macro-cassettes A–H plus four ordinary cassettes I–L, which clearly indicates that the material is a radical prostatectomy specimen (apex, basis, seminal vesicles, capsule, lymph nodes).  	: No  	: The text states “Kan inte bestämmas fynd” (findings cannot be determined). No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignancy is given, so the malignant/benign status remains undetermined.  	: No  	: Since malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is acceptable for a pathology report; minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “anterioriskt förändringar”) is understandable in context and does not impede comprehension.
506	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “formalinfixerade spånar” (formalin-fixed chips), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection) chips. Weight and cassette handling are also mentioned, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states that “tumorvävnad” is present in roughly half of the chips and occupies about 35 % of the tissue surface, confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The report gives the Gleason pattern distribution: “närmast Gleason 4 differentiering, mindre andel av Gleason 5” and concludes with “poängsumman blir således 9.” This translates directly to Gleason 4+5=9.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard histopathological phrasing. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “so att” should be “så att”, “Påängsumman” should be “Poängsumman”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
507	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	61	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “formalinfixerade prov” (formalin-fixed specimens) and gives a total weight, but it never explicitly states the source of the tissue (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not confidently assessed.  	: Yes  	: The text clearly reports “dåligt differentierad” (poorly differentiated) carcinoma and “cribriform körtlar” (cribriform glands), both unequivocally malignant findings.  	: No  	: Although malignancy is confirmed, no Gleason pattern numbers (major, minor) or sum are provided, nor can they be reliably inferred from the wording.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “so” should be “så”, “över hälften av proven undersökts” is missing an auxiliary verb). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
508	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “representativa biopsier från höger och vänster lob”, confirming that the sample type is needle biopsies from both lobes.  	: Yes  	: The text clearly identifies two separate foci of prostatic adenocarcinoma (one in the right base and one in the left mid-portion) and explicitly states “Cancerfynd”, so malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “Gleasonpoängsumma 6 (3+3)”, which translates to major pattern 3 + minor pattern 3 = sum 6.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; minor colloquialisms such as “dom” instead of “de” are acceptable in clinical notes and do not impede comprehension.
509	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	62	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prov 1-6 från höger och vänster lob” (Samples 1-6 from right and left lob), which clearly identifies the material as prostate needle biopsies.  	: Partially  	: The report states that “ingen carcinoma” (no carcinoma) was found in the other samples, but it also mentions “ett litet fokus av förändring” and “annat förändringsfokus” whose nature “kan inte bestämmas” (cannot be determined). Because the pathologist explicitly refrains from classifying these foci as benign or malignant, the malignancy status remains inconclusive rather than definitively benign.  	: No  	: No Gleason grading information is provided, and the report explicitly indicates that the type of the observed foci cannot be determined, making any Gleason score impossible to infer.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable despite minor grammatical issues (e.g., “förändringfokus” should be “förändringsfokus”, “i dom andra prov” should be “i de andra proven”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
510	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “PROSTATEKTOMIREPORT” and describes macroscopic slices and examination of lymph nodes, which unambiguously identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The text lists “Antal tumorfoci: 3”, gives a tumour percentage, and provides Gleason scores, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  	: Yes  	: The report gives “Den vanligaste Gleason klassen: 4” (primary pattern 4), “Den nästvanligaste Gleason klassen: 4” (secondary pattern 4), and “Gleason summa: 8”, which translates directly to 4+4=8.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and concise, using standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians; minor Swedish abbreviations like “mm” and “0/3” are conventional and do not impede comprehension.
511	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	63	2	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “6 makrosnitt” (six macroscopic slices) and gives weight (80 g), which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “radical prostatectomy” itself is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly confirmed.  	: Partially  	: The text states that “tre suspekt område” (three suspicious areas) were found, but it never explicitly confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The absence of a definitive malignant diagnosis leaves the malignancy status ambiguous.  	: No  	: Neither primary nor secondary Gleason grades are provided, and no Gleason score is given. Therefore, the Gleason information cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains grammatical omissions (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent punctuation) and some awkward phrasing (“Mest av fynd var…”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension, but polishing would improve clarity.
512	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	64	2	0	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “vävnadsspånor” (tissue chips/shavings) taken “nära urotelcellerna” (close to urothelial cells), which strongly implies transurethral resection (TUR-P) material, but the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated.  	: Yes  	: The pathologists confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma with updated Gleason grades, so malignancy is clearly established.  	: Yes  	: The updated Gleason pattern is explicitly given as “differentieringsgrad 4 (dominerande) och grad 3, med även tertiär grad 5.” In standard notation this translates to 4 + 3 = 7 with tertiary 5, i.e., Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3).  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains some non-standard phrasing (e.g., “atrofisk och kanske atypiskt pattern” mixes Swedish and English; “brännartefakter” is colloquial for cautery artefacts). These are minor domain-specific quirks and do not impede comprehension.
513	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	65	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “rutin mässigsystematisk biopsi” (routine systematic biopsy) and later “ett par riktade biopsier” (a couple of targeted biopsies). These phrases clearly identify the sample type as needle-core biopsies.	: Yes  	: The statement reports malignant findings in both the initial biopsy (“minimalt fokus med 3+3=6 Gleason”) and the later targeted biopsy (“stort fokus … huvudsakligen tillväxtmönster 4 … näst vanligaste tillväxtmönster är 5”). Thus malignancy is confirmed.	: Partially  	: A Gleason score is given for the initial biopsy (3+3=6). For the later biopsy only the dominant pattern (4) and the secondary pattern (5) are described verbally; no explicit sum is provided. Therefore the Gleason score in the required format can be inferred as 4+5=9, but it is not stated outright.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor spelling/grammar issues (“mässigsystematisk” should be “mässig systematisk”, “inlendingsvis” should be “inledningsvis”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
514	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	66	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen type, and it also refers to additional samples (lymph-node packets and seminal vesicles) that were examined. Therefore the sample type is clearly stated.	: Yes  	: The text confirms the presence of “multifokal adenokarcinom” (multifocal adenocarcinoma) in the prostate, i.e. malignant findings. It also explicitly states that the newly examined lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are benign (“rena”, “endast normalt cellmaterial”). Thus the malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: Gleason scores are provided for the primary tumour: Gleason 4+4, 3+3, 3+4 and 4+3. These are valid Gleason patterns that allow the major, minor and sum scores to be inferred (e.g. 4+4=8, 3+3=6, 3+4=7, 4+3=7).	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as “fynden är benigna” and “kancern” (colloquial spelling of “cancern”) are acceptable in clinical notes and do not impede comprehension.
515	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostatakörtelvävnad,” which clearly identifies the sample as transurethral resection (TUR-P) chippings.  	: Yes  	: The text states “histologiska tecken på adenocarcinom” and “fynden är förenliga med prostatacancer,” confirming a malignant diagnosis.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “3+4=7,” satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is professional, grammatically correct, and understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons.
516	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	67	2	1	: Partially  	: The statement mentions “samtlida insända vävnadsbitar” (multiple tissue pieces submitted together) and describes them as “prostatakörtelvävnad” (prostate gland tissue). However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type remains ambiguous.  	: Partially  	: The report speaks of “histologiska tecken av suspekt förändringar” (histological signs of suspicious changes) and “höggradiga förändringar” (high-grade changes), implying malignancy. Yet it simultaneously says the findings “inte graderas enligt Gleason-systemet” (are not graded according to the Gleason system) and uses the phrase “fynden är förenliga med medelhög risk” (findings compatible with intermediate risk). This leaves the definitive malignant status somewhat unclear.  	: No  	: The text explicitly states that the findings are not graded with the Gleason system, so no major, minor, or summed Gleason scores are provided or can be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is professional and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “samtlida” instead of “samlade”) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
517	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which is the Swedish equivalent of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. This clearly identifies the sample type.  	: Yes  	: The statement repeatedly states that only benign properties are seen (“endast benign egenskaper”, “bara benign egenskaper”). Therefore, malignancy status is explicitly given as negative.  	: No  	: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required. Consequently, no major/minor/sum scores are available.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar is concise and domain-appropriate; the capitalised summary and the use of “T=77100, M=09450” are standard Swedish pathology report conventions and perfectly understandable to professionals.
518	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	68	2	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “Prov examineras totalt i 3 block” implies that the specimen is processed as three tissue blocks, which is compatible with any prostate specimen type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.  	: No  	: The summary line “BARA VARIERANDE EGENSKAPER” (only varying features) and the absence of any mention of malignancy or carcinoma indicate that no malignant findings are reported. Yet the wording is vague; it neither confirms benign status nor explicitly states “no cancer seen.” Therefore malignancy status cannot be reliably assessed.  	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which such scores could be inferred.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but telegraphic and non-standard (“Prov examineras totalt i 3 block”, “BARA VARIERANDE EGENSKAPER”). Capitalization is inconsistent and the line “T=, M=” is cryptic. These issues do not render the text incomprehensible, but clearer phrasing (e.g., “Inga maligna fynd” and explicit sample type) would improve lay understanding.
519	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “PROSTATABIOPSIER” (prostate biopsies) and lists left- and right-sided specimens, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “BARA BENIGN EGENSKAPER” (only benign features) and no mention of carcinoma, PIN, or any malignant findings. Therefore the benign status is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; the statement does not provide or imply any Gleason scores.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise medical Swedish, understandable to clinicians and lay readers familiar with basic terminology. Minor abbreviations (PIN, T/M codes) are standard in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
520	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	69	2	1	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostataprov” (prostate samples/biopsies) and distinguishes left (VÄNSTER) and right (HÖGER) sides, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.  	: No  	: The statement only reports inflammation (“akut och kronisk inflammation”, “Det finns inflammation”) and explicitly denies PIN (“Ingen PIN-förändringar”, “Ingen PIN”). There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any malignant finding.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor spelling/typing errors (“iflammation” instead of “inflammation”, “NÅGRA BLANDAD EGENSKAPER T= M=” appears truncated). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a quick proof-read would improve clarity.
521	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement states that “hittas ingen lämning av malignitet” (no remnants of malignancy are found) and that only benign features are present. This confirms that the findings are benign rather than malignant.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “hittas ingen lämning av malignitet” instead of “ingen malignitet påträffades”). The overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
522	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	70	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “Prostataprov” (prostate specimen/sample) and “Prostata” (prostate), which clearly indicates the material is from the prostate. However, it does not specify whether the sample is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Osäkert av fynd” (findings uncertain) and asks for discussion at MDT (multidisciplinary team). There is no statement confirming either malignant or benign findings; the status is left undetermined.	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The language is understandable but contains minor grammatical/spelling issues (e.g., “infammation” should be “inflammation”, “Osäkert av fynd” is slightly awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
523	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips/shavings), which is a standard term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly states “Ingen malignitet” (no malignancy), so the malignant status is unambiguous.	: Not applicable  	: Because no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence Gleason scores cannot and need not be provided.	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalised “SAMMANFATTNING” and the use of “T=…, M=…” are common in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
524	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	71	2	1	: Partially  	: The phrase “prostastaprov” clearly indicates a prostate specimen, but the exact type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not specified.  	: No  	: The report only mentions “akut och kronisk inflammation och andra diverse fynd” and states “svårighet med att bestämma fynd.” There is no statement confirming either malignancy or benign status; the findings are explicitly described as inconclusive.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor described, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable overall, but “prostastaprov” should be written as “prostata-prov” or “prostatabiopsi” for clarity, and “i block” would be clearer as “i snitt/block.”
525	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostatbiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and the left/right descriptions refer to fragmented and intact cores, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.	: Yes  	: The summary states “endast benign egenskaper” (only benign features) and each side is described as benign with no mention of malignancy, PIN, or invasive cancer. Therefore the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.	: Not applicable  	: Because no adenocarcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence no Gleason scores are provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish is concise and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (“fragmenterad benign cylindrar” instead of “fragmenterade benigna cylindrar”) is acceptable in this clinical context and does not impede comprehension.
526	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	72	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and “fragmenterad prostata prov” (fragmented prostate sample), which clearly indicate that the material is prostate tissue. However, it does not specify whether the samples come from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.	: Partially  	: The left side mentions “PIN-förändringar” (PIN changes), which are premalignant, and “andra bildningar” (other formations) that could imply malignancy, but no explicit statement of adenocarcinoma is given. The right side explicitly states “ingen suspekt” (no suspicion). Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable; the left side is suspicious but not confirmed malignant, and the right side is benign.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which they could be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues such as missing articles (“prostata prov” should be “prostata-prov” or “prostatabiopsi”) and the cryptic “T=, M=,” at the end. These do not prevent comprehension but could be clearer.
527	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.  	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally reports “Acinar prostata adenocarcinoma” and lists a Gleason score, confirming malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The primary and secondary Gleason grades are given as 3 and 3, respectively, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 6 (3+3).  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in clear, professional Swedish with standard medical terminology. While it contains some non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Ställe av närmaste plats”), these are domain-typical and do not hinder comprehension.
528	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	73	2	1	: Partially  	: The text lists “PROSTATA” as a heading, which strongly implies that the specimen is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether the sample comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.	: No  	: Although the form contains fields for Gleason grades and tumour characteristics, every field is left blank or marked “Nej”. The summary line ends with “PROSTATAPROV - , GLEASON SCORE, GRADE GROUP .” – essentially an empty template. Because no malignant (or benign) diagnosis is actually written, the malignancy status cannot be assessed from the text.	: No  	: The primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason grades are all missing, and the Gleason score field is empty. Without any numeric values provided, the Gleason pattern (major+minor=sum) cannot be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable, but the repeated blank fields and the truncated summary (“PROSTATAPROV - , GLEASON SCORE, GRADE GROUP .”) make the statement look like an unfilled template rather than a complete report. Minor grammatical omissions (e.g., missing verbs or values) slightly reduce clarity for a lay reader.
529	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “Prostataspån” (prostate chips), which is the standard Swedish term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) material. Therefore the sample type is clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The statement rules out invasive disease (“Ingen invasis sjukdom”) and only reports PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). PIN is a premalignant change, not overt malignancy. Thus we can assess that no invasive carcinoma is present, but we cannot state that the findings are definitively benign because PIN is still an abnormal finding.	: No  	: No adenocarcinoma is reported, so no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is understandable but contains minor spelling/grammar issues: “PIN-förändringat” should be “PIN-förändringar”, “invasis” should be “invasiv”, and “representativt i 16 block” would read more naturally as “representativt fördelat i 16 block”. These do not impede comprehension.
530	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	74	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and “block”, which implies tissue blocks from a prostate specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The statement explicitly says “Kan inte avslutas typ av invasiv sjukdom” (“Cannot conclude type of invasive disease”). Only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is reported, which is a pre-malignant change, not invasive carcinoma. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and no invasive carcinoma is identified. Therefore Gleason grading is not assessable.	: Minor mistakes  	: The wording is understandable to a layman, but the sentence structure is slightly telegraphic (“Ses fokusområden av PIN”). A clearer phrasing would be “Fokala områden med PIN ses” (“Focal areas of PIN are seen”).
531	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatacylindrar” (prostate cylinders) and “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies), clearly indicating that the material consists of prostate biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The report states “ingen invasiv malignitet” (no invasive malignancy) on the left side and “ingen … invasiv malignitet” on the right side. Therefore, the findings are explicitly benign; no malignant tumour is present.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no invasive malignancy was identified, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is concise and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., fragment numbering, PIN abbreviation) are common in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
532	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	75	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and “prostataprov” (prostate specimens), but it does not explicitly state the type of material (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further specification.	: Partially  	: The left side is reported to contain “PIN” (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is a premalignant finding, not overt carcinoma. The right side is inconclusive (“inte möjligt att bestämma förändringar”). Thus malignancy status cannot be clearly determined as either benign or malignant.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the information given.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “prostata prov” should be “prostata-prov” or “prostataspecimen”; “PIN och andra diverse bildningar” is slightly awkward). Overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
533	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary section, so the sample type is unambiguous.  	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “Prostata adenocarcinoma” and provides details such as Gleason score, tumour size, and extraprostatic extension, confirming the presence of malignancy.  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is given as 3, the secondary as 4, and the total Gleason score is stated as 7. This directly translates to the standard format 3+4=7.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in Swedish medical terminology that is understandable to a trained reader. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Ställe av spridning”) is acceptable within the domain; overall the grammar and clarity are sufficient for a layman with basic medical literacy.
534	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	76	2	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy template (apex, base, peripheral, anterior margins, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated (e.g. “radical prostatectomy specimen”), so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason fields are left blank (“Primär Gleason grad:”, “Sekundär Gleason grad:”, “Gleason score:”, “Grade Group”). The summary explicitly says “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ FÖRÄNDRINGAR, GRADE GROUP.” Therefore, malignancy status cannot be determined from the text.	: No  	: No numerical Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the report states that changes and grade group “cannot be determined.” Consequently, Gleason score cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The report is understandable, but it contains several minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Fynd invecklar fettvävnad” should probably be “fynd innefattar fettvävnad”; “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ FÖRÄNDRINGAR” is missing a preposition). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
535	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostataspån” (prostate chips), which is the Swedish term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. This clearly identifies the sample type.	: Yes  	: The text states “Upptäcks ingen malignitet” (no malignancy detected) and the summary lists “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore, the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and understandable. Minor non-standard phrasing such as “Ses områden körtlars och stromas hyperplasi” is acceptable in pathology reports; it conveys that areas of glandular and stromal hyperplasia are seen.
536	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	77	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and “undersöks representativt i block” (examined representatively in blocks), which implies a tissue specimen, but it does not specify whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.  	: No  	: The statement describes “körtels och stromas hyperplasi” (glandular and stromal hyperplasia) and “några förändringar” (some changes), but no mention of malignancy or prostate adenocarcinoma is provided. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not applicable.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but slightly telegraphic; “körtlars” would be the correct genitive form instead of “körtels”, and “några förändringar” is vague. Overall the message is clear to a lay reader, but minor grammatical adjustments would improve clarity.
537	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATABIOPSI” (prostate biopsy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Partially  	: The right-side biopsy shows atypical glands lacking basal cells (ASAP/PIN), which is a premalignant finding rather than overt malignancy. No prostate adenocarcinoma is reported, so malignancy status cannot be fully assessed as “malignant”.	: No  	: No Gleason grading is provided or implied; the findings are ASAP/PIN, not adenocarcinoma, so Gleason scores are not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and uses standard terminology (ASAP, PIN). Minor Swedish abbreviations (e.g., “cylindrar”) are understandable in context.
538	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	78	2	1	: Yes  	: The text explicitly states “prostata prov” (prostate specimen) for both left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identifiable as prostate biopsies.	: Partially  	: The pathologist describes a 0.3 mm cluster of atypical glands lacking basal cells, raising suspicion for malignancy or ASAP/PIN, but explicitly states that malignancy “cannot be determined.” Therefore malignancy status is inconclusive rather than confirmed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the description.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Kan inte determineras” should be “kan inte fastställas” or “kan inte avgöras”; “relaterar till” is repeated awkwardly). Overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
539	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary section, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “Prostatas adenocarcinoma” and lists malignant features such as Gleason score, tumour size, and perineural invasion. There is no ambiguity about the presence of malignancy.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the total Gleason score is stated as 7. This directly translates to 4 + 3 = 7, satisfying the required format.	: Minor mistakes  	: The text is generally understandable, but it contains several non-standard or awkward phrases (e.g., “oväsentlig negativ lymfkörtel,” “Ställe av närmaste plats,” “T=77000, 1X010, M = 81403”). These do not impede comprehension for a domain reader but would benefit from minor grammatical polishing for a lay audience.
540	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	79	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as “PROSTATA” (prostate) and mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen/sample). Although it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, the detailed examination of margins, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, and capsular penetration implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. Thus, the sample type can be assessed.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Tumör typ: Kunde inte erkännas” (tumor type could not be identified) and “PROSTATA PROV - KUNDE INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ GRUND AV PROVKONTAMINATION” (prostate specimen could not be determined due to specimen contamination). Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether malignant findings are present or not.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grades and Gleason score) are marked with dashes (“-”), indicating that no Gleason grading could be assigned. Consequently, the Gleason score in the format major+minor=sum cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are appropriate for a pathology report. While some phrasing is slightly non-standard (e.g., “Ställe av närmaste plats”), this is acceptable within the domain. The text is comprehensible to a layman with minimal medical knowledge.
541	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which clearly identifies the specimen as TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “bara benigna egenskaper” (only benign features) and “syns bara benign tecken” (only benign signs are seen), so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  	: Not applicable  	: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and domain-appropriate; any lay reader would understand that the chips were examined and found benign.
542	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	80	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that the entire specimen has been examined in blocks, which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The summary only lists “några diverse fynd” (various findings) and mentions chronic inflammation and “suspekt fynd” (suspicious findings), but no malignant diagnosis is given. Because the examination could not be completed due to contamination, malignancy status remains undetermined.  	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is neither reported nor inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and concise; minor non-standard abbreviations (e.g., “T=, M=”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
543	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “prostatacylindrar” (prostate cylinders), i.e. needle biopsies from both left and right sides.  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are explicitly reported: “acinar adenocarcinoma” in two of five cylinders on the right side. The left side is described as benign.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given as “primär Gleason grad 4, sekundär 3” and the summary states “MAXIMAL GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3)”, which directly translates to major 4 + minor 3 = 7.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite some non-standard phrasing (e.g. “infiltrerat sig med” instead of “infiltrerade av”). The essential information is conveyed clearly to both professionals and informed laypersons.
544	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	81	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate samples) and “prostataprov” (prostate specimen), which clearly indicates the material is prostate tissue, but it does not specify the type of procedure (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: The report states that findings are “svårt att tolka” (difficult to interpret) due to specimen contamination and explicitly concludes that “ytterligare examination” (further examination) is required. This means malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out from the information given.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text. The findings are described as inconclusive, so no grading information is available.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is generally understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues (e.g., “diverse fynd” should probably be “olika fynd” or “flera fynd,” and “cirka 60% om det prov” is awkward; likely intended “cirka 60 % av provet”). These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
545	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy) and lists separate specimens such as “ANTERIORISKT FETT” and “PROSTATA”, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The statement clearly indicates malignancy: “Tumörtyp: Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” and the summary confirms “PROSTATAS ADENOCARCINOMA”.	: Yes  	: Both primary and secondary Gleason grades are given (4 and 4), and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8, so the format 4+4=8 is directly inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in understandable Swedish with only minor grammatical quirks (e.g., “Ställe av närmaste plats” instead of “Plats för närmaste marginal”), but these do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
546	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	82	2	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV”, which clearly indicates that the material examined is prostatic tissue. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Inga tecken av malignitet” (no signs of malignancy) and leaves all tumour-related fields blank or marked “Inte bestämd” (not determined). Because the findings are inconclusive and require re-examination, we cannot definitively say whether the tissue is benign or malignant; the status is therefore unassessable.	: Not applicable  	: Since no tumour was identified and all Gleason-related fields are either blank or marked “Inte bestämd”, there is no basis for assigning a Gleason score. Consequently, Gleason assessment is not applicable.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are standard for a Swedish pathology report. While lay readers may need help with some terms (e.g., “seminalvehikeln”), the overall language is clear and appropriate for the intended medical audience.
547	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to TUR-P/TUR-BT (transurethral resection) specimens. Thus the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report states that adenocarcinoma (malignant) is present in approximately 27 % of the chips, so malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 3 + 4 = 7, fulfilling the requirement for major, minor and sum scores.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report; any lay reader with basic familiarity would understand the key points.
548	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	83	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that it has been “undersökts i sin helhet i blok” (examined in its entirety in blocks), which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  	: No  	: The summary line “DIVERSE FYND, BEHÖVS YTTERLIGARE EXAMINATION” (various findings, further examination needed) explicitly indicates that no definitive benign or malignant conclusion has been reached. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are domain-specific and acceptable.
549	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “prostatbiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and specifies left- and right-side cylinders, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: Yes  	: It explicitly reports “acinar adenocarcinoma” in the left-side cylinders and summarizes “adenocarcinoma på vänster sida,” confirming malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The text gives “primär Gleason grad 3 och sekundär 3,” which translates to Gleason pattern 3+3=6, and the summary repeats “MAXIMAL GLEASON SCORE 6 (3+3).”	: Appropriate  	: The language is concise and domain-appropriate; minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “cylindrar infiltrerads”) is understandable in a pathology context and does not impede comprehension.
550	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	84	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate specimen) and distinguishes between left and right sides, implying a bilateral biopsy or TURP-type sampling. However, the exact procedure (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.	: Partially  	: The left side is described as having “några suspekt fynd” (some suspicious findings) with possible perineural invasion, strongly suggesting malignancy, yet no definitive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is given. The right side is explicitly benign with PIN. Because malignancy is only suspected and not confirmed, the malignancy status can only be partially assessed.	: No  	: The summary explicitly states “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS MAX GLEASON SCORE OCH GRADE GROUP” (maximum Gleason score and grade group cannot be determined). No Gleason pattern numbers are provided anywhere, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical oddities (e.g., “infiltrerades sig” should be “infiltrerades” or “visade infiltration”; “Hittas PIN-förändringar” should be “PIN-förändringar påträffades”). These issues are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
551	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” in the summary, clearly identifying the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.	: Yes  	: The report confirms the presence of malignant findings: “Acinar prostata adenocarcinoma” is explicitly stated, along with extensive tumour spread (capsular penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, positive margins, etc.).	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is 4, the secondary is 5, and the Gleason score is given as 9. Thus the pattern can be expressed as 4 + 5 = 9.	: Appropriate  	: The text is well-structured and understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “tävker” instead of “täcker”). All key information is conveyed clearly.
552	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	85	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV”, which clearly points to a prostate specimen, but it never explicitly states whether this is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.	: No  	: The report repeatedly states that the tumour type is “Oklart” (unclear) and that the findings “KUNDE INTE BESTÄMMAS” (could not be determined). No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given; the case is inconclusive and requires further investigation. Hence malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, and total score) are left blank. No numerical or descriptive Gleason information is provided, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and vocabulary are typical of Swedish pathology reports and are understandable to a professional reader. While lay readers might struggle with abbreviations like “UICC TNM 8th edition”, the language is otherwise appropriate for the domain.
553	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimens. The phrase “12 block” confirms that the entire TUR-P material has been processed into 12 paraffin blocks. Thus the sample type is clearly identifiable.	: Yes  	: The report states that “prostatas adenocarcinoma” is present in 8 of 104 chips, i.e. malignant findings are explicitly documented.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+3=7” and is repeated in the summary as “Gleason score 7 (4 + 3)”. Therefore the major (4), minor (3) and sum (7) components are all explicitly provided.	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise, uses standard Swedish medical terminology, and is readily understandable to clinicians or informed laypersons. No grammatical or comprehension issues are present.
554	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	86	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate samples) and that “cirka 8 prov” are examined, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.	: No  	: The summary states “OKLARA FYND” (unclear findings) and “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) without confirming malignancy. Suspicion is not a definitive malignant diagnosis, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the findings are explicitly described as unclear, making Gleason assessment impossible.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable within a medical context. Minor stylistic choices like “Prov undersöks i sin helhet” are acceptable in pathology reports.
555	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATABIOPSIER” (prostate biopsies) and describes findings in six cylinders from each side, confirming the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  	: Yes  	: Both left and right sides are reported to contain “infiltrerad acinar adenocarcinoma,” clearly indicating malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The summary states “MAXIMAL GLEASON SCORE 7 (3+4)”, which directly provides the major pattern (3), minor pattern (4), and sum (7).  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in clear Swedish medical terminology that would be readily understood by clinicians; while it contains Swedish abbreviations and phrasing, these are standard in Nordic pathology reports and pose no barrier to comprehension.
556	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	87	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the material as “prostata prov” (prostate biopsies) from left and right sides, so the sample type is unambiguous.	: No  	: The findings are explicitly described as “oklara” (unclear) and “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes), but no definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The message is understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “i olika ställer” (should be “på olika ställen”), “infiltrerad med diverse fynd” (better “infiltrerade av”), and inconsistent use of plural/singular. These do not prevent comprehension but could be improved.
557	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” in the summary, which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  	: Yes  	: The report unequivocally diagnoses “Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” and lists multiple malignant features (capsular penetration, bladder-neck invasion, vascular/perineural invasion).  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is 3, the secondary is 5, and the Gleason score is given as 8. From this we can directly infer the pattern 3+5=8.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Tertiär Gleason grad: nej” instead of “Tertiär Gleason grad saknas”). Overall grammar and terminology are suitable for a pathology report.
558	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	88	2	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (capsule, seminal vesicles, margins, etc.), which strongly implies that the specimen is prostate tissue. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The report explicitly states “Tumör typ: OKLAR” (tumour type: UNCLEAR) and “Kan inte bestämmas fynd” (findings cannot be determined). No malignant diagnosis is given; instead, the findings are described as “OKLARA OCH DIVERSE FYND” (unclear and miscellaneous findings). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grade and Gleason score) are marked “-” (missing). No numeric or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and terminology are typical of a Swedish pathology report and are understandable to a clinician or informed layperson. Minor non-standard formatting (e.g., repeated dashes) is domain-appropriate and does not impede comprehension.
559	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips) examined in 7 blocks, which is the standard way TUR-P (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens are handled. Therefore the sample type is clearly identified as TUR-P chips.	: Yes  	: The report states that “prostatas adenocarcinoma” (prostate adenocarcinoma) is found in about 40 % of the chips. This unequivocally indicates a malignant finding.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 5 + 5 = 10, satisfying the requirement for major + minor = sum.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report. Minor colloquialisms such as “cirka” and “hittas” are acceptable in this context and do not hinder comprehension.
560	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	89	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen) but does not specify whether the material is biopsies, TUR-P chips, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.	: No  	: While “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) raises concern, the statement explicitly avoids confirming malignancy. It remains inconclusive, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: No  	: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Prov undesökat” likely intended “Prov undersökt”; “suspekt förändringar” should be “suspekta förändringar”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
561	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) and separately mentions “prostatas fettvävnad” (periprostatic adipose tissue). These designations unambiguously indicate the sample type.	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states the presence of “acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” with extensive local spread (capsular penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, bladder-neck invasion, vascular/perineural invasion) and metastatic tumour in the adipose tissue. Thus malignancy is clearly confirmed.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is given as 5, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8 (5+3). No tertiary pattern is reported. Therefore the required Gleason information is fully present.	: Appropriate  	: The language is medical but understandable; minor non-standard phrasing such as “vänster posteriorisk” instead of “vänster posteriort” and “precis ren” instead of “helt ren” are acceptable within the histopathology domain and do not impede comprehension.
562	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	90	2	1	: Partially  	: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen), which implies a prostate sample, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.	: No  	: The text repeatedly uses phrases such as “suspekt fynd”, “några förändringar”, and “oklar klassificering”. These indicate that malignancy has not been confirmed; the findings are suspicious but inconclusive. Thus malignancy cannot be assessed as present or absent.	: No  	: Although fields for primary, secondary, tertiary Gleason grade and Gleason score are listed, none of them are filled in. Consequently the Gleason score cannot be inferred or assessed.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Upptäcks några suspekt fynd” should be “Upptäckta några suspekta fynd”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
563	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	2	0	: Yes  	: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.	: Yes  	: The report repeatedly mentions “adenocarcinoma” and “malignant” findings, including extraprostatic extension, seminal-vesicle invasion, and metastasis to periprostatic fat. Thus malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is given as 5, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8 (5+3). Therefore the major+minor=sum format is directly provided.	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite some non-standard Swedish phrasing (e.g. “vänster posteriorisk”, “precis ren”). Medical terminology is used correctly and the overall meaning is clear to a trained reader.
564	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	91	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (capsule penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, bladder-neck invasion, multiple margin sites, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so we can only partially infer it.	: No  	: Although the form lists “Tumör typ” and Gleason fields, every value is left blank and the summary explicitly says “några förändringar, oklar klassificering” (some changes, unclear classification). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from the text.	: No  	: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grades and total score) are empty; no numeric or descriptive information is provided that would allow inference of a Gleason score.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor omissions (e.g., blank fields) are acceptable in a template-style report; the overall grammar and clarity are appropriate.
565	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens. The phrase “spån har undersökt i sin helhet i 14 block” clearly identifies the sample type as TUR-P chips examined in 14 blocks.	: Yes  	: The report states that “i 17/257 … spån” prostate adenocarcinoma is found, and the summary line reads “PROSTATASPÅN: ADENOCARCINOMA”. This unambiguously indicates malignant findings.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is explicitly given as “4+5=9” in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum scores are directly available.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “spån har undersökt” could be “spån har undersökts”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
566	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	92	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate sample) and that the entire specimen is processed into blocks, which implies a biopsy set. However, the exact sample type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.	: No  	: The report only states that “suspect changes” are seen in about 7 % of the samples and that it is “impossible to categorise” them. No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.	: Not applicable  	: Since no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “i cirka 7 % av proven ses suspekt förändringar” could read “i cirka 7 % av proven ses suspekta förändringar”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
567	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	93	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies” (PROSTATABIOPSIER) and specifies that six cylinders were examined on the left side, clearly indicating the sample type.	: Yes  	: The left-side cylinders are unequivocally reported as infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma, while the right side is explicitly stated to show no malignancy. Thus, malignancy status is fully assessable.	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given as primary 4 and secondary 5, with the sum explicitly stated as 9 (4+5). This meets the required format.	: Appropriate  	: The language is clear and understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “cylindrar infiltrerads”). All key information is conveyed accurately and would be comprehensible to a layman.
568	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	93	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and distinguishes “vänster” (left) and “höger” (right), which implies a paired biopsy set. However, it never explicitly states the sample type (e.g., core biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.	: Partially  	: The report describes “infiltrerad med några förändringar, vars karaktär är oklara” (infiltrated with some changes of unclear nature) and labels them “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes). This indicates that malignancy cannot be ruled out, but it is not confirmed either. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “prostata prov” should preferably be “prostatabiopsi” or “prostatavävnad”; “Fynds maximal längd” should be “Fyndets maximala längd”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
569	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATA” and “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  	: Yes  	: The report states “Tumörtyp: Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” and later “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI - PROSTATAS ADENOCARCINOMA”, confirming the presence of malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The primary Gleason grade is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7. Therefore the pattern 4+3=7 is directly provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The text is written in Swedish medical terminology that is clear and understandable to professionals. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “ledig av tumör” instead of “fria från tumör”) is common in Swedish pathology reports and does not impede comprehension.
570	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	94	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (capsule penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, margins, etc.), so the specimen is clearly from the prostate. However, the exact type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated. The presence of regional lymph-node packets suggests a radical prostatectomy, but this is only inferred.	: Partially  	: The prostate section is described as having “några suspekt förändringar” (some suspicious changes) and an “oklart Gleason score” (unclear Gleason score). This indicates that malignancy cannot be ruled out, yet it is not confirmed either. The lymph-node packets are explicitly negative for tumour. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.	: No  	: Neither primary, secondary nor tertiary Gleason grades are provided, and the Gleason score field is left blank. The summary explicitly states “oklart Gleason score klassificering”. Therefore the Gleason score in the required format cannot be determined.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical oddities such as “alla ledig av tumör” (should be “alla fria från tumör”) and inconsistent punctuation. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
571	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	95	2	0	: Yes  	: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) chips. This clearly identifies the sample type.	: Yes  	: The statement unequivocally reports the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma in 15 of 153 chips, so malignancy is confirmed.	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as 3 + 5 = 8, satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “spån har undersökt” could read “spån har undersökts”) do not impede understanding for a lay reader.
572	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	95	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and that the entire specimen is examined in blocks, which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TUR-P, or radical-prostatectomy tissue.  	: No  	: The report only states “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “kräver ytterligare undersökning” (requires further examination). This indicates that malignancy has neither been confirmed nor excluded; therefore the malignant status cannot be assessed.  	: Not applicable  	: Because malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are left empty, which is acceptable in a preliminary report.
573	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATABIOPSIER” (prostate biopsies) and describes findings in left and right cylinders, clearly indicating the sample type is needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: The text repeatedly states “infiltrerad acinar adenocarcinoma” in both left and right biopsies, confirming malignant findings.  	: Yes  	: The summary gives “MAXIMAL GLEASON SCORE 10 (5+5)”, which directly provides major pattern 5, minor pattern 5, and sum 10.  	: Appropriate  	: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “cylindrar”, “cirka 95 % av den cylinder”). The key information is conveyed clearly to a lay reader.
574	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	96	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate samples) twice, which implies that the material examined consists of prostate biopsies. However, the exact type of specimen (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.	: Partially  	: The report describes “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) and uses terms such as “infiltrerad” and “perineural invasion,” which strongly suggest malignancy. Nevertheless, the wording stops short of a definitive malignant diagnosis (“KRÄVER YTTERLIGARE UNDERSÖKNING” – requires further investigation). Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully confirmed from the statement alone.	: No  	: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) or any equivalent grading information is provided. The suspicious findings are described qualitatively, but no numerical Gleason scores are mentioned or can be inferred.	: Minor mistakes  	: The Swedish text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “några prostata prov” should probably be “några prostata-prov” or “några prostatabiopsier”; “Fynds maximal längd” should be “Fyndets maximala längd”). These do not impede overall comprehension but are noticeable.
575	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen (explicitly stated in the summary section: “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI”).  	: Yes  	: Malignant findings are explicitly reported: “Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” in the prostate and metastatic adenocarcinoma in pelvic lymph nodes.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason score is given directly as 5 + 5 = 10 (Gleason score 10).  	: Appropriate  	: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “ledig av tumör” instead of “fria från tumör”). Technical terms are used correctly and the overall meaning is clear to a layman with basic medical literacy.
576	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	97	2	1	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy (prostate + regional lymph-node dissection). The presence of prostate tissue, bilateral obturator and iliac lymph nodes, and seminal vesicles is explicitly listed, so the sample type is unequivocally assessable.  	: Partially  	: While the lymph-node stations are reported as mostly tumour-free, the prostate section itself is left blank for all tumour-related fields and is summarised as “några suspekt fynd, kan inte bestämmas” (“some suspicious findings, cannot be determined”). Thus malignancy status for the prostate is inconclusive; only the lymph-node status is clearly benign.  	: No  	: All Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grade and Gleason score) are empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason pattern could be inferred.  	: Appropriate  	: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable, although it uses some non-standard abbreviations and formatting common in pathology reports. A lay reader might need clarification on terms like “ledig av tumör” (“free of tumour”), but overall the language is appropriate for its domain.
577	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	2	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions “Resektion genom urinrör” (transurethral resection) and that it yielded 10 g of chips, which clearly identifies the sample as a TUR-P (TURP) specimen.  	: Yes  	: The text states that “tecken av adenocarcinoma” (signs of adenocarcinoma) were found, confirming a malignant diagnosis.  	: Yes  	: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “major 4 och minor 3”, so the score can be expressed as 4 + 3 = 7.  	: Minor mistakes  	: The overall message is understandable, but there are several awkward or non-standard phrases (“vid undervisning” should probably be “vid undersökning”, “invänt av” likely means “invented by/observed by”, “cribriform-strukturer var invänt” is ungrammatical). These do not prevent comprehension but would benefit from correction for clarity.
578	moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct	98	2	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions that the specimen weighs 10 g, which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). The weight alone is insufficient to determine the sample type definitively.	: Partially  	": The statement indicates ""tecken av några suspekt förändringar"" (signs of some suspicious changes) and mentions ""tvivel av GLEASON mönster"" (doubt about Gleason pattern), suggesting malignancy is suspected but not confirmed. The presence of ""cribriform"" pattern further supports suspicion of cancer, but the wording is inconclusive."	: No  	": While ""major"" and ""minor"" components are mentioned (40% and 10% respectively), no specific Gleason scores (e.g., 3+4=7) are provided. The term ""tvivel av GLEASON mönster"" explicitly casts doubt on the Gleason grading, making it impossible to extract valid scores."	: Major mistakes  	": The text contains significant grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., ""Majot komponent"", ""jämförelsevis normal ses benign hyperplasi""). Terms like ""invänt av Lars Läkare"" are unclear. While some domain-specific terms are understandable, the overall structure hinders comprehension. Suggested corrections: ""Major komponenten utgör cirka 40% av området"", ""I jämförelsevis normala områden ses benign hyperplasi""."
579	openai/o1	0	0	0	: Yes	: The statement describes “chipping samples” in grams, which typically implies transurethral resection or similar sampling, so the sample type is identifiable.	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions benign prostate tissue with no signs of malignancy.	: Not applicable	: No Gleason score is needed or provided because no malignancy was identified.	: Appropriate	: The grammar is understandable and coherent for both medical and general audiences.
580	openai/o1	0	0	1	: No	: The statement merely mentions “a lot sample material” without specifying whether it is from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.	: No	: It explicitly states that no inference about cell atypia or malignancy can be drawn, preventing assessment of malignant findings.	: No	: The Gleason score is not mentioned, and there is no data to infer it.	: Minor mistakes	: The statement is generally understandable, but phrases such as “a lot sample material” could be improved for clarity (e.g., “a large amount of sample material”).
581	openai/o1	1	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement explicitly mentions 12 representative needle biopsies.  	: Yes  	: It clearly concludes that only benign-like growth is found.  	: Not applicable  	: Gleason grading is not relevant as no malignancy is identified.  	: Minor mistakes  	": Grammar and meaning are understandable overall, but ""grandular"" should be ""glandular""."
582	openai/o1	1	0	1	: Partially	: The statement suggests “representative prostate cancer samples,” but does not explicitly specify biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy	: No	: While the text mentions “prostate cancer samples,” it does not confirm a final malignant or benign finding, as the interpretation is still pending	: No	: No Gleason grading is provided, so nothing can be inferred about Gleason scores	: Appropriate	: The statement is grammatically coherent and understandable for a layman, with no significant errors
583	openai/o1	2	0	0	: Yes  	: The statement clearly identifies the sample as a “fresh prostatectomy specimen,” so the sample type can be assessed.  	: Yes  	: The text explicitly indicates benign findings, no malignant features are observed, so the presence or absence of malignancy is assessable.  	: Not applicable  	: No malignant tumor is found, so Gleason scoring is not relevant in this context.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is written in a clear, understandable manner and is grammatically acceptable.
584	openai/o1	2	0	1	: Yes	: The text explicitly states that the sample is from an autopsy specimen, i.e., post-mortem tissue for research use.	: No	: The statement concludes that malignancy cannot be reliably inferred at this stage due to inflammatory and age-related changes.	: No	: No Gleason grading or relevant details are provided, and the sample’s status remains inconclusive.	: Minor mistakes	: The text is largely clear, but “cannot be reliable inferred” should read “cannot be reliably inferred.”
585	openai/o1	3	0	0	: Yes	: The sample is explicitly stated to be prostate chippings, which allows clear identification of the sample type.	: Yes	: The statement explicitly states that there is no indication of malignancy.	: Not applicable	: Since there is no malignancy, no Gleason score is provided or needed.	: Minor mistakes	: The statement is understandable overall, though “In histologial inspection” contains a minor spelling error (“histologial” should be “histological”).
586	openai/o1	3	0	1	: No	: The statement does not clearly indicate whether this is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.	: No	: The text concludes that no definitive findings can be made regarding malignancy due to burn artefacts.	: No	: There is no mention or suggestion of Gleason scoring in the statement.	: Appropriate	: The statement is understandable and coherent, with no significant grammatical errors.
587	openai/o1	4	0	0	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions that the sample type is prostate biopsies.	: Yes	: The statement indicates benign findings and absence of adenocarcinoma or PIN.	: Not applicable	: As there is no malignancy, Gleason scoring is not relevant here.	: Appropriate	: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable for a layperson.
588	openai/o1	4	0	1	: Partially  	: The text mentions multiple sampling sites from standard locations, suggesting prostate biopsy cores, but it does not explicitly specify the procedure type (biopsy, TURP, or prostatectomy).  	: No  	: The report states the sample material is insufficient to rule in or out malignancy, so a definitive assessment of malignancy cannot be made.  	: No  	: Because no definite cancer diagnosis is made, Gleason scoring cannot be provided from the statement.  	: Appropriate  	: The grammar and wording are clear without evident mistakes, and the statement is understandable as presented.
589	openai/o1	5	0	0	: Yes	: The statement explicitly mentions the specimen as a “radical prostatectomy.”	: Yes	: Malignant (cancerous) tissue is described in the apex blocks.	: Yes	: Gleason scores are stated as 4+3=7 and 4+5=9.	: Minor mistakes	: The text mostly reads fluently, but “seminal vehicle” should be “seminal vesicle.”
590	openai/o1	5	0	1	: Partially  	: The text indicates that specimens were taken from an enlarged prostate, including apex and basis with color-coding, but does not explicitly confirm whether these were biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy.  	: No  	: The report does not definitively state whether malignancy is present or absent, leaving this aspect inconclusive.  	: No  	: Although Gleason is mentioned, it cannot be resolved because no actual major+minor=sum data are provided.  	: Appropriate  	: The statement is coherent and understandable with no major grammatical issues.
591	openai/o1	6	0	0	: Yes	: The description of “shaving chips” suggests clear TURP-type prostate tissue sampling.	: Yes	: The statement explicitly indicates a benign process (BPH), so malignancy status can be assessed as negative.	: Not applicable	: No malignant lesion is described, so Gleason scoring does not apply.	: Minor mistakes	: Slight spelling issues (“grandular” vs. “glandular,” “casettes” vs. “cassettes”) but otherwise clear and understandable.
592	openai/o1	6	0	1	: Partially	: The statement clarifies that it is from prostatic operation material, but does not specify whether it is from a radical prostatectomy, TURP, or another type of operative procedure.	: No	: The finding is inconclusive; heavy burn artefact prevents definitive determination of malignant or benign status.	: No	: There is no reference to any Gleason grading in the statement, so it cannot be assessed.	: Appropriate	: The statement’s grammar and terminology are coherent and understandable; no major issues are apparent.
593	openai/o1	7	0	0								
594	openai/o1	7	0	1	: No	: The statement does not clarify if the material was obtained via biopsy, TURP, or another procedure.	: No	: The text explicitly states that no definite conclusions could be drawn regarding malignancy.	: No	: Gleason grading is not mentioned or otherwise inferable from the statement.	: Appropriate	: The text is generally clear and comprehensible for a non-specialist, with no major grammatical errors.
