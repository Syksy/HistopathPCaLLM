#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly mentions “höyläyslastuja” (TURP chips) and gives the weight (≈30 g) and block distribution, so the sample type is unequivocally transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that only benign prostatic tissue is seen, with no atypia, malignancy, or carcinoma, confirming a benign finding.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignancy is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot and need not be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor stylistic choices such as “missä ei … näy” are acceptable in pathology reports.
