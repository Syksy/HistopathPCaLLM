#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that “prostatakudosta” (prostate tissue) is identified, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further specification.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly says that “päättelyä … maligniteetista, tai karsinoomasta ei voida tehdä” (no conclusion about malignancy or carcinoma can be drawn). Thus, malignancy status remains undetermined rather than confirmed benign or malignant.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report; it uses standard medical phrasing understandable to clinicians.
