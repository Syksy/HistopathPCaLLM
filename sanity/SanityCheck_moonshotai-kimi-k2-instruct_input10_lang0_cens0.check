#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “8 representative prostate systematic biopsies from typical locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that the focus is “too tiny to give a definitive diagnosis of carcinoma” and that the diagnosis is “uncertain although leaning towards benign.” This means malignancy has neither been confirmed nor ruled out; the findings are inconclusive.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no carcinoma was confirmed, no Gleason grade (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layperson.
