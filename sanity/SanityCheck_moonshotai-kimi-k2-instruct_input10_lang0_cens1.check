#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and “prostate tissue material,” but it does not specify the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: The text only refers to “normal basal cells” and “suspicious formations” without confirming the presence or absence of malignancy. No diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign findings is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is available or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is generally clear and understandable, although slightly verbose. It is suitable for a lay reader with minimal effort.
