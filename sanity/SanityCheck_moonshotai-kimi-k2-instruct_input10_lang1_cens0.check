#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “8 kpl edustavia prostatan systeemibiopsioita” (8 representative systematic prostate biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified.  

#3: No  
#4: The conclusion states that the diagnosis is uncertain and leans toward benign (“diagnoosi epävarma, benigniin päin”). Because no definite malignant finding is given, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is confirmed, Gleason grading is not provided and is not applicable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in standard Finnish medical terminology understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader; grammar and clarity are acceptable.
