#1: No  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) arriving in eight separate batches, but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only refers to “normaalia basaalisolukkoa” (normal basal cell tissue) and to “epäilys … epäonnistumisesta” (suspicion of failure) of immunostains. There is no statement confirming or excluding malignancy; the findings are inconclusive.  

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable but contains some awkward phrasing (e.g., “mitkä viittaisivat siihen että värjäykset epäonnistuivat”). Replacing “mitkä” with “jotka” and adding commas would improve clarity, yet the overall meaning remains accessible to a lay reader.
