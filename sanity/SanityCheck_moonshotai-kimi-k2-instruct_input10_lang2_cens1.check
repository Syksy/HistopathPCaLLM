#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate samples) arriving in eight separate batches, which implies a prostate specimen type, but it never explicitly states whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only reports “normal basalvävnad” (normal basal tissue) in the preliminary examination and discusses technical issues with immunostaining panels. There is no mention of malignant or benign findings, nor any diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is present or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text mixes Swedish and Finnish in a somewhat awkward way (“bad kom”, “fästning av proven”, “Instituutin käyttämässä kokeellisessa immunologisten värjäysten paneeleissa”). While the intended meaning is understandable to a professional reader, the grammar is non-standard and could confuse a layperson. Minor corrections would improve clarity—for example, “kom i åtta separata batchar” (Swedish) or “tuli kahdeksassa erässä” (Finnish), and consistent language choice.
