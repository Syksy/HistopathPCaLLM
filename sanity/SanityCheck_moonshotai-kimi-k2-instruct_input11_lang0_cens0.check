#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement describes “invasive tumor tissue” with “malignant focus” and gives a Gleason score, confirming that malignant findings are present.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason grading is explicitly given as “4+3,” from which the sum (7) can be directly inferred.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several non-standard or awkward word choices (“preparate,” “grandular,” “basis and the vehicles”). “Preparate” should be “specimen” or “preparation,” “grandular” should be “glandular,” and “basis and the vehicles” likely intends “base and seminal vesicles.” These issues do not render the text incomprehensible but could confuse a lay reader.
