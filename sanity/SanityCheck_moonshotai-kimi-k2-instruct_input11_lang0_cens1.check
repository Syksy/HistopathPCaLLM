#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “all parts of the prostate including the basis, apex and mid section,” which implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement does not declare the findings malignant or benign. It only notes that “tubular structures of varying differentiation stages” are seen and that Gleason scores “could not be reliably assessed.” Without a clear statement of malignancy, the malignancy status cannot be determined.

#5: No  
#6: Although the text refers to “score 4 and score 3,” it explicitly says these “could not be reliably assessed” and provides no actual Gleason pattern assignments (major + minor = sum). Thus the required Gleason information is absent.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is generally clear and understandable, even if slightly verbose. There are no major grammatical errors that would hinder comprehension by a lay reader.
