#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that “all parts of the prostate including base, apex and mid-section were examined”, which implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP) is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement describes “prostate tissue forming tubular structures with variable degrees of differentiation”, which is suggestive of adenocarcinoma, but it never explicitly declares “malignant” or “adenocarcinoma present”. The inability to reliably assess Gleason components and the disclaimer about high-grade PIN further weaken the clarity.

#5: No  
#6: Although the text mentions “values 4 and 3” as the most common Gleason components in this setting, it immediately states that these values “cannot be reliably assessed” because only ~5 % of the material was examined. Therefore no usable Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is generally understandable, but some phrasing is awkward or non-standard (e.g. “prostatasolukkoa”, “epäluotettavana”). A lay reader would grasp the gist, yet clearer wording such as “prostate tissue” instead of “prostatasolukkoa” and “could not be reliably assessed” instead of “ei pystytä luotettavasti tarkastelemaan” would improve readability.
