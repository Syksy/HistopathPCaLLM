#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “suspected prostate cancer tissue” implies the material is tissue from the prostate, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only says the tissue is “suspected” of being cancer and that the high-resolution images are still in the queue. No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis has been rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The sentence structure is understandable and the terminology is suitable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “has been started in eight batches”) do not impede comprehension.
