#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that the sample “koostuu epäillystä eturauhassyöpäsolukosta” (consists of suspected prostate-cancer tissue) and that it has been “käynnistetty kahdeksassa osassa” (started in eight parts). This implies the material is a multi-part specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether it is biopsy cores, TURP chips, or a radical-prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only says the tissue is “epäilty eturauhassyöpäsolukko” (suspected prostate-cancer tissue) and that “korkearesoluutioiset kuvat ovat toistaiseksi odottamassa digipatologian jonossa” (high-resolution images are still waiting in the digital pathology queue). No definitive malignant diagnosis is given, nor is benign status confirmed. Hence, malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis has been rendered, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; the only slightly technical phrase “digipatologian jonossa” is acceptable in a pathology report context.
