#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “samples taken from typical locations in the prostate,” which implies prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only refers to “irregularities” and a “suspicious pattern” that “warrant further inspection.” It does not confirm the presence of malignancy, nor does it state that the findings are benign. The outcome is explicitly deferred to further consultation, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices such as “a bit more total sample material” and “out of the ordinary inflammation” are acceptable in clinical narrative and do not impede comprehension.
