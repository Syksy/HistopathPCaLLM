#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions that samples were taken from “typical locations of the prostate” and compares the amount of material from the right versus the left side. This clearly indicates that the specimen type is prostate tissue obtained by biopsy (multiple cores from both lobes).  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement describes “some abnormalities” in sample B that are suspicious enough to warrant consultation with a colleague. However, it stops short of confirming malignancy; it only labels the pattern as “suspect” and states that confirmation is still pending. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully assessed from the text alone.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major pattern, minor pattern, or sum) are provided, nor is there any numerical or descriptive information from which these could be inferred. The only mention is of “abnormal differentiation patterns” without further detail.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and mostly appropriate, but it contains a few non-standard or awkward phrases (e.g., “hitusen verran enemmän”, “tasoisia erilaistumispatterneja”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a more formal wording would improve clarity.
