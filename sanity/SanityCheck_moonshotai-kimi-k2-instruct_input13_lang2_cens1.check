#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that samples (“prov”) have been taken from “typical places” and that the total volume is slightly larger on the right side than on the left. This implies that some form of prostate tissue sampling (likely biopsies) has been performed, but the exact sample type (biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement indicates that in sample B “några anomali” (some anomalies) with a “differentieringmönster” (differentiation pattern) are found that are suspicious enough to warrant consultation with a colleague. This strongly suggests a possible malignancy, but the wording is deliberately cautious (“suspekt mönster”) and no outright diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully confirmed from the text alone.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is mentioned, nor is there any information from which a Gleason score could be inferred. The only descriptor is a vague “differentieringmönster” without numerical grading.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues: “typisk ställer” should probably be “typiska ställen”; “den höger sida” → “den högra sidan”; “differentieringmönster” → “differentieringsmönster”; “kolleg” → “kollega”; “suspekt mönster” → “suspekta mönster”; “normal mönster” → “normala mönster”; “atypisk inflammation” → “atypisk inflammation”. These errors do not render the text incomprehensible, but they are noticeable.
