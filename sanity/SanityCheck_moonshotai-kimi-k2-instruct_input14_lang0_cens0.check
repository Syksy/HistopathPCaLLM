#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “a prostatetectomy preparate,” which clearly indicates a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement reports “some tumorous growth is observed peripherally” and “the found tumors exhibit Gleason 7-stage carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason sum (7) is given, and the major pattern (3) is stated to constitute ≈60 % of the tumor. However, the minor pattern is not explicitly provided, so the exact major+minor=sum format cannot be fully reconstructed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: While the intended meaning is understandable, there are several grammatical and word-choice issues: “prostatetectomy preparate” should be “prostatectomy specimen,” “run on casettes” should be “processed in cassettes,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and “pos. surgical margins” should be “positive surgical margins.”
