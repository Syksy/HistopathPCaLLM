#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostate tissue” and “samples D-G, K-P, O-Q,” which implies a multi-part specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: While “special patterns of cell growth” are noted, no definitive diagnosis of malignancy (e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma) is given. The text explicitly says further investigation is needed and that no statement affecting intervention decisions can be made. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement.

#5: No  
#6: The only mention of Gleason is an anecdotal comparison to “a different, recent Gleason 7 score patient.” No actual Gleason grade (major + minor = sum) is provided for the current specimen, nor can it be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“run on casettes,” “through-out sampling”) and minor grammatical issues (“seminal vehicle” likely meant “seminal vesicle”). These do not render it incomprehensible, but a careful copy-edit would improve clarity.
