#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostatektomia-preparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard cassette-by-cassette handling, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement reports “kasvainta” (tumor) and “tuumori” (tumor) in the peripheral zone and explicitly labels the findings as “Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa” (Gleason 7-level carcinoma), confirming malignancy.

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason score of 7 is given, and the pattern distribution is described (“isompi osuus scoorauksella 3 n. 60%”), implying a likely 3 + 4 = 7. However, the exact minor pattern (4) is not explicitly stated, so the full major+minor=sum format cannot be asserted with complete certainty.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “scoorauksella”) is domain-typical and does not impede comprehension.
