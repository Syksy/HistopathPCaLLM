#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that the material is “ajettu kaseteilla” (processed into cassettes) and refers to “kattava katsaus potilaan prostatakudokseen”, which implies a systematic sampling typical of either a radical prostatectomy or a large TURP. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: No  
#4: Although “erikoisia kasvurakenteita” (peculiar growth patterns) are noted, the report explicitly says that a final evaluation is postponed until the uro-meeting next week and that further sampling is needed to rule out “keski-graduksen GG löydökset” (intermediate-grade Grade Group findings). Therefore, malignancy is not confirmed in this statement.

#5: No  
#6: The only Gleason information is an anecdotal comparison to another patient who “oli saanut Gleason 7 luokituksen”. No actual Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is given for the current case, nor can it be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology. While a layman might not grasp every detail, the grammar and style are appropriate for a histopathology report.
