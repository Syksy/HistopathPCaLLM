#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes how it has been sliced and placed in cassettes, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “några tumör” (some tumours) are seen in the peripheral zone and close to the capsule, confirming the presence of malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason score is given: “Gleason 7-höjd carcinoma, varav större andel score 3 (ca. 60%)”. This implies a pattern distribution of 3 + 4 = 7 (since 60 % pattern 3 and the remainder pattern 4), but the exact major/minor breakdown is not spelled out, so the information is only partially complete.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “några tumör” should be “några tumörer”, “i den första snitten” should be “i de första snitten”). These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
