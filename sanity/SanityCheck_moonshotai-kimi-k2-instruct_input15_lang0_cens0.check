#1: Yes
#2: The phrase “Prostate chippings totalling to weight approximately 5g” clearly indicates that the material is transurethral resection (TUR-P) chips, so the sample type can be assessed.

#3: Yes
#4: The statement explicitly says “scopic inspection … does confirm adenocarcinoma through-out the sample material,” so malignancy is unequivocally established.

#5: Partially
#6: The text gives “Gleason 4 being the most represented … leading to a sum of 8.” This implies a pattern 4+4=8, but the minor pattern is not explicitly stated. Therefore the full major+minor=sum triplet can only be inferred, not directly read.

#7: Appropriate
#8: The wording is understandable to a lay reader despite minor stylistic quirks (“scopic inspection through the shavings”). No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
