#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostatan höylälastuja” (prostatic chippings), which is the Finnish term for TURP (transurethral resection) chips. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement says “lähes kaikissa nähdään adenokarsinoomaa” (adenocarcinoma is seen in almost all [chips]), so malignancy is unequivocally present.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The text gives “Gleason 4:ää … pistesumma 8”. Interpreting this as Gleason pattern 4+4=8 is the only clinically reasonable reading, so the major, minor and sum scores can be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is colloquial but fully understandable to a lay reader; no grammatical errors impede comprehension.
