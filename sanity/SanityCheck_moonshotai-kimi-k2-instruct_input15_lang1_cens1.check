#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatan kudosmateriaali” (prostate tissue material) and that “kaikki materiaali on prosessoitu,” which implies a tissue sample was examined, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement explicitly says that “edustavaa Gleasonia tai muuta markkeria ei tässä kohtaa voida vahvistaa” (a representative Gleason or other marker cannot be confirmed at this point). It also mentions “epäilyksen adenokarsinoomasta” (suspicion of adenocarcinoma) but stresses this is not based on histopathology. Thus, malignancy status is explicitly undetermined and cannot be assessed from the current findings.

#5: No  
#6: The text states that no representative Gleason score can be confirmed at this stage; any mention of Gleason 8 / ISUP GG 4 is explicitly noted as not based on histopathology. Therefore, no valid Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The language is generally understandable, but there are minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “skooppitutkimuksessa näytemateriaalin läpi vahvistetaan että kliiniset symptomit voivat hyvin perustua histopatologiaan” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but polishing would improve clarity.
