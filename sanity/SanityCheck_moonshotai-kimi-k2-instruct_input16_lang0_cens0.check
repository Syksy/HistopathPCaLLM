#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “three fusion biopsies from a suspicious focus in the prostate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as targeted (MRI-fusion) prostate biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “approximately half contains carcinoma focuses” and describes carcinoma lengths and architectural patterns, confirming the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report provides the relative proportions of Gleason pattern 3 (≈2/3) and pattern 4 (≈1/3) within the carcinoma, allowing the Gleason score to be inferred as 3 + 4 = 7.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “level 3 grade growth” instead of “Gleason grade 3”) do not impede comprehension.
