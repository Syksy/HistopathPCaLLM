#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “multiple suspicious foci from the prostate” but never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further precision.

#3: Partially  
#4: The text repeatedly refers to “suspicious foci,” “various grades of cell differentiation,” and “mid-grade differentiation,” strongly implying malignancy. However, it never unequivocally states “adenocarcinoma” or “malignant,” so the malignancy status remains partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Although the authors speculate about possible Gleason patterns (3+4 or 4+3), they explicitly declare that assigning explicit scores is “inconclusive” and that grading “ought to be conducted manually.” Thus no actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or reliably inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is generally clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “differentation” instead of “differentiation,” “reliable assess” instead of “reliably assess”) do not impede comprehension.
