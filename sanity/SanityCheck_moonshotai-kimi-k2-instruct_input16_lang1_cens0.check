#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “kolme fuusiobiopsiaa” (three fusion biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes “karsinoomafokuksia” (carcinoma foci) and gives their lengths, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason architectural patterns are described (grade 3 and grade 4) and their relative proportions are given (≈2/3 pattern 3 and ≈1/3 pattern 4). From this one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not stated in the canonical “major+minor=sum” format, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “score 7 yhteensä”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
