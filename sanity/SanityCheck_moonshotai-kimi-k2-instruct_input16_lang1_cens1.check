#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “useammasta suspektista fokuksesta prostatassa” and “kudosta”, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue”, not the exact specimen type.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement clearly indicates that malignant-appearing (suspect) foci are present and that varying differentiation grades were observed. However, it simultaneously declares that an exact score cannot be assigned because of resolution problems in the digitised images. Thus malignancy is strongly suggested but not formally confirmed with a grade.  

#5: No  
#6: Although the text explicitly refers to possible intermediate grades such as “3+4” or “4+3”, it states that assigning a precise Gleason score is impossible due to the digitisation artefact. Consequently, no definite major + minor = sum triplet can be extracted.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable to a layman, but it contains several spelling/grammatical errors (e.g. “mahdoonta”, “Näisä”, “minkään keski-graden … erilaistuminen voisi olla erittäin vaikeaa arvioida”). These do not impede comprehension but should be corrected for clarity.
