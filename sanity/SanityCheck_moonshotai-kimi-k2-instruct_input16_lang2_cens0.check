#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “fusiobiopsier” (fusion biopsies), clearly identifying the sample type as needle biopsies obtained under MRI-guidance.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes “carcinomafokus” (carcinoma foci) and mentions “grad 3 växt” and “Gleason 4 looping strukturer,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives architectural proportions (≈2/3 pattern 3 and ≈1/3 pattern 4) and states “score 7 totalt,” which implies a Gleason sum of 7. However, the exact major+minor pattern notation (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+3=7) is not explicitly provided; one must infer that pattern 3 predominates, suggesting 3+4=7, but this is not stated outright.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues: “långdt” should be “längd,” “carcinomafokus” should be “carcinomafoci” or “carcinomafokus (plural),” and “Fynd score 7 totalt 15mm” is awkwardly phrased. A clearer wording would be “Gleasonsumma 7 (3+4) över en total cancerlängd av 15 mm.”
