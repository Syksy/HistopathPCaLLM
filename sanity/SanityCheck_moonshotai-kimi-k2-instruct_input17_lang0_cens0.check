#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes “multiple clear foci” with “the most dominant Gleason grade 4 along with some grade 3,” confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: While the dominant pattern is stated as grade 4 and some grade 3 is present, the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not given, so the full Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be precisely reconstructed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues (e.g., “preparate” should be “specimen,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and “basis” should be “base”).
