#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatetomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard slicing and colour-coding protocol used for such specimens, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “useampi selkeä fokus” (several clear foci) of tumour are seen, with a predominant Gleason grade 4 and some grade 3. It also notes extensive perineural invasion and capsular penetration. These are unequivocal malignant findings.

#5: Yes  
#6: The predominant pattern is given as grade 4 and the secondary pattern as grade 3. From this we can infer the standard Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is slightly technical and uses abbreviations (“s.e.” for “sitä että”), but it is well-structured and understandable to a layman with basic familiarity of pathology reports.
