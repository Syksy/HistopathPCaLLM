#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate” and describes multiple tissue blocks (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O) taken from base to apex, which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the actual word “radical prostatectomy” (or “biopsies”, “TURP”) is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that the differentiation grades (Gleason 3–5) may or may not be present and that the material may be “completely normal”. No malignant diagnosis is given; the final evaluation is deferred to a later session. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from this text.

#5: No  
#6: Although Gleason grades 3–5 are mentioned as a possible range, no actual tumour is identified and no specific Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided. The assessment is postponed, so the score cannot be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable but contains non-standard or awkward phrasing (“todnäk”, “täyskropan kuvantamisella”, “seminaalivehikkelien”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but would benefit from minor corrections (e.g. “todennäköisesti”, “koko leikkeen kuvantaminen”, “seminaarikalvojen”).
