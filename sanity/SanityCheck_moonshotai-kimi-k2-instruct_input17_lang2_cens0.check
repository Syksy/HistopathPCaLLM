#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the standard macroscopic handling of such a specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “man ser flera klar fokus … med dominerande Gleason klass 4 och också någon med klass 3”, confirming malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 4 and a minor component as Gleason 3, so the major+minor pattern can be inferred as 4+3. However, no explicit sum (Gleason score) is stated, so the complete “major+minor=sum” format is only partially assessable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains several non-standard grammatical constructions and spelling issues (e.g. “Prostatektomipreparat igångsatts”, “båda sidar”, “dominerande Gleason klass 4”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but standard phrasing would improve clarity.
