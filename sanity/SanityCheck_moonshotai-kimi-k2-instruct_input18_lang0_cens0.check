#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings obtained through standard shaving procedure,” which clearly indicates the sample type is TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) chippings.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “a small fraction appears to be carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason sum of 7 is provided, and the text mentions that “the larger fraction with stage 3 representing about 60% of the tumor area.” From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason pattern 4 (the “larger fraction”) plus pattern 3, giving 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor scores are not explicitly written, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology (e.g., “chippings,” “carcinoma,” “Gleason sum 7”). No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
