#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “höyläyksestä saatuja lastuja” (chips from TURP), so the sample type is clearly transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “pienessä osassa nähdään karsinoomaa” (carcinoma is seen in a small part) and later refers to “neoplastiseksi tulkittavassa osuudessa” (the part interpreted as neoplastic), confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason sum of 7 is given, and the major pattern is stated to be 3 (≈60 % of the tumor). However, the minor pattern is not explicitly stated, so the exact format “major+minor=sum” cannot be fully reconstructed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “pienessä osassa”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish.
