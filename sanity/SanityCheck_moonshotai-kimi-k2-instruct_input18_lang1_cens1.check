#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that the material is obtained “in connection with standard prostate procedures” and is processed in twelve tissue parts, but it never explicitly states whether the specimens are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy slices. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue obtained during a standard procedure,” but not specified precisely.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report explicitly raises the possibility of ISUP GG 1 (Gleason Grade Group 1) or higher in a small focus (<5 %), yet simultaneously states that the focus is too small for reliable grading. Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status remains equivocal rather than clearly assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Although the text mentions “ISUP GG 1 or higher,” no actual Gleason pattern scores (major + minor = sum) are provided, and the focus is explicitly deemed too small for reliable grading. Thus, no complete Gleason score can be extracted.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable; any lay reader with basic medical vocabulary can grasp the message. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prosessoidaan kahdessatoista kudos-osassa”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish.
