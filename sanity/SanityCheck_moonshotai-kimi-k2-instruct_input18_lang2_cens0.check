#1: Yes  
#2: The statement mentions “spånor” (chips) obtained from “hyvling” (shaving), which in clinical practice corresponds to TUR-P/TUR-B (transurethral resection) chips. Thus the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “man ser carcinoma” (carcinoma is seen) and describes architectural patterns typical of prostate adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy is confirmed.

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason sum of 7 is given, and the relative proportions of pattern 3 (60 %) and pattern 4 (implied 40 %) are provided. However, the exact major + minor pattern notation (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7 or 4 + 3 = 7) is not explicitly stated, so the full Gleason score in the requested format cannot be unambiguously extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical oddities (e.g., “var igångsatt i 12 vävnadblock” should be “lades in i 12 vävnadskassetter” or similar). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a native speaker would notice the awkward phrasing.
