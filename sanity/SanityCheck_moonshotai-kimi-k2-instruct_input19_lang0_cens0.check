#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “targeted prostate biopsies from the typical sampling locations,” which clearly identifies the sample type as prostate biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement reports that sample 4 “appears to contain adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding. Samples 2 and 3 are described as “healthy benign prostate tissue,” and sample 1 is “unrepresentative,” so the malignancy status is fully assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given as “Gleason 3, approx 90%” and “Gleason 4, 10%.” From this we can infer the major pattern is 3, the minor pattern is 4, and the sum is 3 + 4 = 7.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “grandular” instead of “glandular”) do not impede comprehension.
