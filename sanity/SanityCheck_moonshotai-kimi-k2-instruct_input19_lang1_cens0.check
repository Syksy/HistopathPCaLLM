#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “kohdennetut prostatabiopsiat” (targeted prostate biopsies) taken from typical locations, which clearly identifies the sample type as biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement reports adenocarcinoma in sample 4, confirming a malignant finding. Samples 2 and 3 are described as benign, and sample 1 is non-representative, but the presence of malignancy in at least one sample is unambiguous.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is provided for sample 4: “isompi osuus rauhasrakenteita muodostaen (Gleason 3, noin 90%) ja pienempi osuus rauhasten yhteensulautumista (Gleason 4, 10%)”. From this, the major pattern is 3 (90%) and the minor pattern is 4 (10%), yielding a sum of 7. Thus, the Gleason score can be inferred as 3+4=7.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, though it uses some domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “epäedustava”, “rauhasten yhteensulautumista”) that is acceptable in clinical reports.
