#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatan kudosnäytteitä” (prostate tissue samples) and describes routine handling, but it never explicitly states the clinical context (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a more specific label.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The report explicitly labels samples 2 and 3 as benign. Sample 4 is described as having “soluarkkitehtuureja, jotka poikkeavat normaalista … mahdollisesti malignia,” but the pathologist explicitly questions whether the tissue is even prostate and states that further checks are needed. Thus malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the finding is inconclusive.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable but contains a few non-standard or awkward phrases (“rajatapauksen verran vähästä riittävään määrää”, “labrafibaa”). These do not prevent comprehension but could be polished for clarity.
