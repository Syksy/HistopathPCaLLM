#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies) taken from different sides and typical locations, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement reports “adenocarcinoma” in one of the biopsy cores (prov 4), confirming a malignant finding. The other cores are described as benign (“frisk prostatavävnad”), so malignancy status is assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern distribution is given: approximately 90 % Gleason 3 and 10 % Gleason 4. This translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish text is understandable and uses standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic oddities (e.g., “olika sidor av typiskt ställen”) do not impede comprehension.
