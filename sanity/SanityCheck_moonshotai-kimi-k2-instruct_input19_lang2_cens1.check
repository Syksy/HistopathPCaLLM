#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatas vävnadproven” (prostate tissue samples) and that they were handled “enligt normal rutin för provtyp”, which implies a standard specimen type, but it never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be partially assessed.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text describes “frisk benign prostatavävnad” in samples 2 and 3, and in sample 4 it notes “cellarkitekturer … som avvikar från normal prostatavävnad” and raises the possibility of malignancy. However, the final wording is deliberately inconclusive (“kvalitetssäkring ifrågasätter … möjligen malign”). Thus we can infer that malignancy is suspected but not confirmed, so the malignancy status is only partially assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Som prov prostatas vävnadproven”, “gränsfallsmängd av liten till tillräcklig material”, “innan gås framåt”). These are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible, but they could be improved for clarity.
