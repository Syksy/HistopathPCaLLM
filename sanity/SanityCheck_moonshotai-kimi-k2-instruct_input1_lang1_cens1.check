#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatakudosta sovituista paikoista” (prostate tissue from agreed locations), which implies biopsies, but the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states that the final conclusion is still pending (“Loppupäätelmä on vielä kesken”). Therefore, no information is given about whether malignant or benign findings were identified.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy status is not provided, no Gleason grading can be inferred or stated.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear, concise, and uses standard medical phrasing understandable to a lay reader.
