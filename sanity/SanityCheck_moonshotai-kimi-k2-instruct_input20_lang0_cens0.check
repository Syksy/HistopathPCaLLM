#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly identifies the specimen as a “prostatectomy resection” and mentions that it has been divided into six macrosections and the usual microscopic sections. This clearly indicates the sample type.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “samplings from both the apex and basis present with adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignancy.

#5: Yes  
#6: Two distinct Gleason scores are provided: “Gleason 3+4” for the apex and “class 4+4” for the basis. These are valid Gleason patterns expressed in the required major+minor=sum format (3+4=7 and 4+4=8).

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, professional, and understandable to a layman. Minor stylistic choices such as “class 4+4” instead of “Gleason 4+4” are acceptable within the histopathology domain.
