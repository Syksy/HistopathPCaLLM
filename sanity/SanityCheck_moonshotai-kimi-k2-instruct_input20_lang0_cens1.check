#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “obtained prostate tissue samples” and lists six sets from apex, middle and basis regions, which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.), so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that “examination of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to the therapies given in the region” and that the tissue has been “highly affected.” No malignant or benign diagnosis is provided; the case is declared uninterpretable because of prior treatments. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: Although the text hypothetically mentions “lower level Gleason (such as 3+4),” it immediately negates any actual determination: “examination … is impossible.” No concrete Gleason pattern is given, so the score cannot be extracted.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is formal and somewhat verbose, but it is grammatically correct and understandable to a lay reader.
