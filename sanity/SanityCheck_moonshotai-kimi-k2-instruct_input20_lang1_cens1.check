#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “eturauhaskudoksen näytteet” (prostate tissue samples) and describes their division into six main sets from apex to base, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that “mahdollisen adenokarsinooman arviointi on mahdotonta” (assessment of a possible adenocarcinoma is impossible) due to tissue alterations from prior treatments. Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign finding can be extracted.

#5: No  
#6: Although the text hypothetically mentions “matalan tason Gleason (kuten 3+4)”, it immediately underlines that such a finding is purely hypothetical and cannot be confirmed. Consequently, no actual Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable, using domain-appropriate terminology. While the sentence structure is complex, it remains coherent for a lay reader with some medical background.
