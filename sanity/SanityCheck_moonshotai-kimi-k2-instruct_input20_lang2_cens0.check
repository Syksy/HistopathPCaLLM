#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiresekat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes macroscopic and microscopic sections taken from it, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that sections from both apex and base contain “adenocarcinoma,” confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are provided for both locations: apex is “Gleason 3+4 klass” (3+4=7) and base is “klass 4+4” (4+4=8). These are valid and complete Gleason patterns.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “prostatektomiresekat som prov,” “klass” instead of “klassificeras som”). A layman could grasp the key information, and the medical terminology is used correctly.
