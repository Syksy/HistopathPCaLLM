#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that “prostatavävnads prov … delas till sex huvuduppsättningar” (prostate-tissue samples divided into six main sets), which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the wording is vague and does not explicitly state the sample type, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The text repeatedly stresses that evaluation of potential adenocarcinoma is impossible (“omöjlig”) because the tissue has been altered by prior interventions. It explicitly states that even if a low-grade Gleason pattern were hypothetically found, it would not change management. Therefore, no definitive malignant or benign finding is provided.

#5: No  
#6: Although a hypothetical Gleason score “3+4” is mentioned, it is presented as a purely speculative example (“hypotetisk situation”) rather than an actual diagnosis. No concrete Gleason pattern is assigned to the examined tissue, so the score cannot be assessed.

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The Swedish text is grammatically awkward and contains numerous non-standard constructions (“komplementät sjukdomar”, “påkallad interventioner”, “lokala vården”, “patientens helhetsbild låtar”). These errors obscure the intended meaning and would likely confuse a lay reader.
