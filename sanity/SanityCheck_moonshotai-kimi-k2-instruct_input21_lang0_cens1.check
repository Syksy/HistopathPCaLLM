#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “extracted prostate material” and “fragments,” which implies a fragmented specimen (likely TURP chips or biopsy cores), but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The pathologist explicitly states that nuclei are dissolved, technical noise is high, and cell differentiation patterns cannot be assessed. No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; instead, the case is deferred pending additional QC. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or inferable. The deferral for QC makes Gleason assessment irrelevant at this stage.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues: “half been put to histology” should read “half has been submitted for histology,” and “contain too noisy material” should be “contains material that is too noisy.” These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are not fully polished.
