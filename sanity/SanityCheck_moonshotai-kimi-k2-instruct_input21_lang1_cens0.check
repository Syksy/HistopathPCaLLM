#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “Prostatalastuja” (prostate chips) clearly indicates that the specimen consists of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips, so the sample type can be assessed.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly describes “kasvainkudosta” (tumor tissue) with malignant cytological features (enlarged, variable nuclei with prominent nucleoli) and assigns a Gleason grade, confirming malignancy.

#5: Partially  
#6: The statement reports “eniten tasoa 5 ja toiseksi eniten tasoa 4,” which corresponds to Gleason 5+4. However, the sum (9) is not explicitly stated, so the complete major+minor=sum format is only partially assessable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “mattomaista huonosti erilaistunutta kasvua”) is acceptable within the histopathology domain and does not hinder comprehension.
