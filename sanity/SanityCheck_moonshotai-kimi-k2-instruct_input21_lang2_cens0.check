#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “Prostataspån” (prostate chips/shavings) and the weight given (≈19 g) clearly indicate that the specimen is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly describes malignant features: “illa differentierad växt” (poorly differentiated growth), enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and states that “cirka halva av spåns yte är tumörvävnad” (about half of the chip surface is tumour tissue).  

#5: Yes  
#6: The text gives “Gleason grad är mestadels 5 och näst mest 4”, which translates to Gleason pattern 5 as the dominant (major) grade and pattern 4 as the secondary (minor) grade. Thus the score can be inferred as 5+4=9.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is slightly informal (“var Gleason grad”) but is fully understandable to a clinician or informed lay reader; no corrections are necessary.
