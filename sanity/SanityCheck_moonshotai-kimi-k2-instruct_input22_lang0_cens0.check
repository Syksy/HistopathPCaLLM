#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate thick needle biopsies from both side,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies taken from both the left and right sides of the prostate.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that the left-side fragments show “low grade differentiation of carcinoma tissue structures” and mentions Gleason patterns 3 and 4, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The right-side fragments are explicitly said to show no malignancy. Thus, malignancy status is clearly assessable.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The text indicates “Gleason score 3 and secondly of score 4,” which implies a Gleason pattern 3+4=7. However, it does not explicitly state the major and minor pattern order (i.e., whether 3 is primary or secondary). Therefore, while the sum can be inferred, the exact major/minor breakdown is not unambiguously provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is understandable and largely appropriate for a lay reader, although minor stylistic issues exist (e.g., “differentation” should be “differentiation,” “both side” should be “both sides,” and “score 3 and secondly of score 4” could be clearer as “Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
