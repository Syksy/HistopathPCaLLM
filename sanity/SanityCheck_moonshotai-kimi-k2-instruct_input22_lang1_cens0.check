#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatan paksuneulanäytteitä” (prostate core-needle biopsies) from both sides, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that the left-side fragments contain “matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa” (poorly differentiated carcinoma tissue) and “syöpäkasvustoa” (cancer growth), confirming malignancy. The right-side fragments are explicitly described as non-malignant.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given as “kasvutapaa 3 pääsääntöisesti ja toiseksi eniten tapaa 4”, which translates to a dominant pattern 3 and secondary pattern 4. However, no explicit sum (Gleason score 3+4=7) is stated, so the score can be inferred but is not fully spelled out.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable to a layman with minimal medical terminology. No major grammatical errors are present; only the phrase “kasvutapaa 3” could be slightly clearer as “Gleason-asteikolla pääasiassa kuvio 3 ja toiseksi eniten kuvio 4”.
