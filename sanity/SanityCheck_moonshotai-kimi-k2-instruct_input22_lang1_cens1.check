#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “purkillinen prostatan kudosnäytteitä” (a jar of prostate tissue samples) and refers to left- and right-sided fragments, so we know the material is prostate tissue. However, it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes chronic inflammation, fragmentation, and a wide spectrum of cellular differentiation, but it does not confirm the presence or absence of malignancy. Instead, it questions the origin and integrity of the tissue and concludes that the samples are unsuitable for classification. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: Although the term “Gleason-luokan määrittäminen” (determining the Gleason grade) is mentioned, the text explicitly states that such grading is “poikkeuksellisen vaikeaa” (exceptionally difficult) and that the fragmented, variable samples are unsuitable for classification. No actual Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, even if slightly technical. A layman might need clarification on terms like “Gleason-luokan” or “fragmentoitumista,” but overall the language is appropriate for a pathology report.
