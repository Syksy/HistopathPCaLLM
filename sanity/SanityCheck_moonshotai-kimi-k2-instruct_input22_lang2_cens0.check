#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatas tjocknålbiopsier” (core-needle biopsies of the prostate), so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that “låg differentierande carcinomavävnad” (poorly differentiated carcinoma tissue) is present in the left-sided fragments, and it further specifies “tumörväxt kring nerver” (perineural invasion). These phrases unequivocally indicate malignant findings. The right-sided fragments are described as having “ingen malignitet” (no malignancy), which is also a clear assessment.

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason pattern distribution is given as “mestadels 3 och näst mest 4” (mostly pattern 3 and second-mostly pattern 4). From this we can reasonably infer a major pattern of 3 and a minor pattern of 4, yielding a sum of 7 (3+4=7). However, the exact wording does not explicitly state “Gleason 3+4=7”, so the information is inferable but not fully explicit.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and vocabulary are standard medical Swedish and should be understandable to a lay reader with minimal medical background. No significant errors or ambiguities are present.
