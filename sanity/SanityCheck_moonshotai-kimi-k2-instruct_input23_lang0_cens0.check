#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “Sections from a prostatectomy preparate” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that the sections “present an adenocarcinoma,” confirming a malignant finding.

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives the primary pattern as “differentiation stage 4 (60%)” and the secondary pattern as “stage 5 (approx 30%)”, which translates to Gleason patterns 4 and 5. The tertiary grade 3 is noted as “diminishingly small,” so it does not alter the Gleason score. The conclusion explicitly states “Gleason-score sum 9,” which matches 4 + 5 = 9.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable despite minor stylistic quirks (“prostatectomy preparate,” “differentiation stage 4”). No information is lost, and a lay reader could grasp the key points.
