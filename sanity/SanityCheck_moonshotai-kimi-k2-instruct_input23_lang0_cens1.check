#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “parts of a prepared sample set” and “multiple macro sections and microscopic runs,” which implies that the material is some form of prostate tissue specimen (likely biopsies or TURP chips), but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not clearly assessed.

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement refers to “potential Gleason 3 findings” in an earlier incomplete report, indicating that malignancy is suspected but not yet confirmed in the current examination. Because the current examination itself does not provide a definitive malignant finding, malignancy status remains partially assessable.

#5: Partially  
#6: A prior report is said to have “potential Gleason 3 findings.” This suggests a Gleason pattern 3 component, but no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum is given. Thus, while a Gleason 3 component is hinted at, the full Gleason score (major + minor = sum) cannot be reliably extracted from the statement.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are generally clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “would've been located”) are acceptable in this context and do not impede comprehension.
