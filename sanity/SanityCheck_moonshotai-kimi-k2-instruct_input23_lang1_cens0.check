#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiapreparaastista” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes the processing of macro- and microscopic sections, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “adenokarsinoomamuutosta” (adenocarcinoma) is present, extending from mid-zone to base, confirming a malignant finding.

#5: Yes  
#6: The percentages given for the patterns (60 % grade 4, 30 % grade 5, minimal grade 3) allow the Gleason score to be inferred as 4 + 5 = 9, which is explicitly confirmed in the summary: “Gleason-pistesumma on 9”.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard spelling (“prostatektomiapreparaastista”), and the medical terminology is used correctly for a histopathology report.
