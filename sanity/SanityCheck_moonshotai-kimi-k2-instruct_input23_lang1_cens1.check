#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “valmistellusta näytesetistä” (a prepared sample set) and refers to macro-sections and microscopic examination, which implies a biopsy or TURP-like specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the information is only partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: The text refers to a previous report that mentioned “Gleason luokan 3 löydöksiä” (Gleason grade 3 findings), indicating malignant findings. However, the current statement itself does not confirm malignancy; it only refers back to an earlier, incomplete report. Thus the malignancy status is only partially assessable from this statement alone.

#5: No  
#6: While the earlier report is said to have mentioned “Gleason luokan 3”, no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum score is provided in this statement, nor can such a breakdown be reliably inferred. Therefore the Gleason score in the required format cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish used is professional and understandable, although slightly technical. There are no major grammatical errors or ambiguities that would hinder comprehension by a lay reader.
