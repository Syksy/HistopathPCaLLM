#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “prostatektomipreparat” clearly indicates that the material is a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is unambiguous.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “adenocarcinoma förändring” (adenocarcinoma changes), confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The description gives the relative percentages of Gleason patterns 4 (60 %), 5 (≈30 %) and 3 (tertiary, minimal). From this one can reasonably infer a dominant pattern 4 and secondary pattern 5, yielding Gleason 4+5=9. However, the exact major + minor = sum formulation is not spelled out, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical oddities (e.g. “Representerara” should be “Representerar”, “klass 5 … representerande av” should be “klass 5 … representerar”, “särdeles liten” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
