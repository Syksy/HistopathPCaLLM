#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “turp-chippings,” which clearly identifies the sample type as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) material.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “over 50% of the chippings present … Gleason 4-class tumor growth” and concludes with “sum 8 adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.

#5: Partially  
#6: A total (sum) Gleason score of 8 is provided, but the individual major and minor pattern scores are not explicitly stated. One can only infer that the major pattern is 4 (since >50 % of the tumour is Gleason 4) and the minor pattern is likely 4 as well (to reach the sum of 8), yet this is an inference rather than an explicit report.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains several spelling/grammatical issues: “comfirmatory” → “confirmatory,” “melding” → “melding of glandular acini,” “grandular” → “glandular,” “chronically inflammated” → “chronically inflamed.” These do not impede comprehension but should be corrected for clarity.
