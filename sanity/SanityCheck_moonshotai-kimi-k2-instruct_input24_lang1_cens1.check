#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that the material consists of “biopsioita, radikaaleja prostatektomioita, tai höyläyksiä” (biopsies, radical prostatectomies, or TUR-P specimens), so the possible sample types are listed. However, it does not specify which exact type each individual case represents, only that the pool contains all three.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text explicitly states that the original diagnosis was benign (“benignin diagnoosin saamisen jälkeen”). It then describes that in about 25 % of these originally benign cases the review raised the grade to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4, i.e. to low-grade carcinoma. Thus, malignancy status can be inferred for those re-graded cases, but it is not stated for every single specimen.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason scores (3+3 and 3+4) are given for the subset that was re-graded. However, no individual major/minor/sum triplet is provided for each case, only the two possible patterns mentioned. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be extracted for every specimen.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard or awkward phrasing (e.g. “potilaita, joiden biopsioita… oli saatavilla”, “havainnoillistamaan”, “harjoittelujoiden”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a smoother wording would improve clarity.
