#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “turp-spån” (TURP chips), so the sample type is clearly identified as transurethral resection of the prostate material.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement describes “Gleason 4-klass tumörväxt” and concludes with “adenocarcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason score of 8 is given (“Poängsum uppdaterar till 8”), but only the total sum is provided; the individual major and minor pattern numbers (e.g., 4+4=8) are not explicitly stated, so the full major+minor=sum format cannot be directly verified.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains grammatical oddities such as “halvt igångsatts,” “vävnadkassett,” and “Poängsum uppdaterar.” These do not prevent comprehension but could be improved for clarity (e.g., “halva mängden inkapslades i sex vävnadskassetter,” “poängsumman uppdateras”).
