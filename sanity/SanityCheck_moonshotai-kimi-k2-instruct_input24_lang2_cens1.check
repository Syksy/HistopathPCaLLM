#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsier, radikal prostatektomis eller hyvlingar” (biopsies, radical prostatectomies or TURP specimens), so the sample types are clearly stated.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text indicates that the original diagnosis was benign, but in about 25 % of cases the material was re-classified to Gleason 3+3 or 3+4 after review. Thus, malignancy status is mixed: some cases remained benign, others became malignant. The statement does not allow us to determine the final status for any individual sample.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason scores (3+3 and 3+4) are explicitly given, but only as examples of the re-classified cases. Because the statement does not provide a specific Gleason score for any single specimen, we cannot extract a definitive major+minor=sum for a particular case.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The grammar is understandable but contains several non-standard constructions (e.g., “Prov består av flera av patienter”, “sen granskade”, “den här övnings avsikt”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but smoother phrasing would improve clarity.
