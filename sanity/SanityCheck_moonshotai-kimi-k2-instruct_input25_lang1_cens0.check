#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the material as three separate tissue cores (“kudoslieriötä”), i.e. needle biopsies, and gives their lengths. No further specification is required to determine the sample type.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states that prostate adenocarcinoma is present in samples (1) and (2) and that no atypical tissue is seen in sample (3). Therefore malignancy can be assessed.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The text gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 4 and 3 in the cancerous portions (sample 1: 20 % G4 + 30 % G3; sample 2: 15 % G4 + <35 % G3). From these percentages one can infer that the dominant pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, yielding a Gleason score 3+4=7 in both cores. However, the exact major/minor pattern assignment is not stated outright, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; any layman with basic medical literacy would grasp the findings. Minor stylistic choices (e.g. “vajaa 35 %”) are acceptable in the domain.
