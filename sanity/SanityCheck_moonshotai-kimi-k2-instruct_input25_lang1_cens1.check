#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions three separate samples (1, 2, 3) and describes their microscopic contents, but it never explicitly states what type of material these samples represent (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The conclusion explicitly states that “prostatan adenokarsinooma-löydöstä ei voida luotettavasti vahvistaa tai kumota” (a prostate adenocarcinoma finding cannot be reliably confirmed or ruled out). Hence malignancy status remains undetermined.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy could not be confirmed, no Gleason grading was assigned. The text mentions that in sample (1) “suurin piirtein kaikki pystyttiin arvioimaan Gleason erilaistumispatterniensa suhteen”, but immediately adds that “näkemyseroista johtuen tämä tapaus arvioidaan seuraavassa uro-miitissä” (due to differing opinions the case will be re-evaluated in the next uro-meeting). Thus no usable Gleason score is provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although it uses some domain-specific phrasing (e.g. “uro-miitissä”, “PIN-muutoksia”). A layman might need clarification on technical terms, but overall the statement is clearly expressed.
