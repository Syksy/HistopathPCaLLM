#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatectomy preparate” and describes the sampling scheme (apex, basis, seminal vesicles), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “histological inspection reveals a widely spread tumor,” confirming the presence of malignancy (prostate adenocarcinoma).

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant Gleason pattern is given as “class 3” and pattern 4 is described as “almost as prevalent,” but no explicit minor pattern or summed Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7) is provided. Therefore, the exact major+minor=sum format cannot be fully inferred without making assumptions.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but contains non-standard phrasing such as “preparate” (should be “specimen/preparation”), “basis” (should be “base”), “seminal vehicles” (should be “seminal vesicles”), and “class 3 and class 4 differentation” (should be “Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4 differentiation”). These minor wording issues do not impede overall comprehension.
