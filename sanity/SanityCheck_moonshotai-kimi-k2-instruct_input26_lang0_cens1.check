#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly states that “the studied material originates from the prostate” and that it is “processed according to the usual processing procedures and markings.” These phrases clearly indicate that the sample type is prostate tissue, most likely a radical prostatectomy specimen (apex vs. base orientation is described).  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text mentions “possible ‘Gleason sum 7’” but immediately qualifies it as “unclear if this is GG 2 or 3 and if the 7 sum was indeed verified.” Because the histology is described as “very difficult to assess” owing to recent radiation therapy, the malignancy status is not definitively confirmed; it is only suggested.  

#5: No  
#6: Although a “Gleason sum 7” is referenced, neither the major (primary) nor the minor (secondary) Gleason pattern is provided, nor can they be reliably inferred. The statement explicitly questions the validity of the score, so the required format (major+minor=sum) cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is clear and understandable; the phrasing is slightly formal but remains accessible to a lay reader.
