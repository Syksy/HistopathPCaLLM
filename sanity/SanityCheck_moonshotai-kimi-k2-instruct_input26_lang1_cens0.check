#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes “laaja kasvain” (extensive tumour) and provides details about tumour extent and margins, confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant Gleason grade is given as 3, with “almost as much” grade 4 differentiation, but no explicit minor pattern or summed Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7) is stated. One can infer a likely 3+4=7, yet the exact minor grade is not formally declared.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is professional and understandable; minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “käynnistetään normaalilla kaavalla”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
