#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the material as coming from the prostate (“prostatasta”) and mentions that it is processed according to normal handling procedures. Although the exact specimen type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly named, the description of apex-to-base orientation (A–C toward apex, D–F toward base) is consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can be assessed.

#3: Partially  
#4: The text mentions a possible “Gleason summa 7” in the clinic’s notes, but it explicitly states that histological evaluation is “extremely difficult” due to recent radiotherapy and that reliable histopathology cannot be performed. Thus, malignancy cannot be confidently confirmed from the histopathology itself; only a clinical suspicion is reported.

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason sum of 7 is mentioned, but no primary and secondary pattern numbers are provided, and the text questions whether this corresponds to Grade Group 2 or 3. Because the Gleason score cannot be reliably inferred from the histopathology (due to RT effects), only the clinical note is available, making the assessment partial at best.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology. While lay readers might need clarification on abbreviations like “RT” (radiotherapy), the overall language level is appropriate for a histopathology report.
