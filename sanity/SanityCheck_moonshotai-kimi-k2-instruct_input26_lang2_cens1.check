#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “undersökt material från prostata” and refers to apex and base portions, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.), so the information is only partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: A “möjlig Gleason summa 7” is mentioned, indicating a suspicion of malignancy, but the text immediately underlines that it is “oklart” whether this is confirmed. Thus malignancy is suggested but not definitively established.

#5: Partially  
#6: A “Gleason summa 7” is cited, but no primary (major) or secondary (minor) patterns are provided, nor is it clear whether the sum is 3+4=7 or 4+3=7. Therefore the full Gleason score in the required format cannot be reliably extracted.

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The text contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “behandlas enligt normal behandlingprocedurer och -markering”, “histologisk undervisning”, “summagråd 7”, “histopatologi kan inte tillförlitlig användas”). These issues hinder readability and would likely confuse a lay reader.
