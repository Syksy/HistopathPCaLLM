#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “source prostate tissue” suggests the material is prostate-derived, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatic tissue material” in samples F and G, but it does not clearly declare whether malignant (adenocarcinoma) or benign findings were present. The remark that “growth patterns … did not follow normal prostate tumor differentiation” is ambiguous—it neither confirms malignancy nor benignity. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Although a “Gleason score 3” is mentioned, it is qualified as “debatably … maybe … in small quantities,” with no major/minor pattern breakdown or sum provided. Consequently, a standard Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be reliably extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The wording is generally understandable, but phrases such as “Total dozen grams” and “run in eight batches” are awkward. “Total dozen grams” should probably read “a total of twelve grams,” and “run in eight batches” could be clearer as “processed in eight batches.”
