#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatasta lähtöin oelvaa kudosmateriaalia” (tissue originating from the prostate) processed in eight batches, which implies a tissue sample, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not clearly assessed.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement indicates that the growth patterns in most samples “ei noudattanut normaaleja prostatasyövän erilaistumista” (did not follow normal differentiation of prostate cancer) and that Gleason 3 “olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin” (might possibly have been observed to a small extent). This wording is highly tentative and inconclusive; it neither confirms nor rules out malignancy. Hence malignancy status is only partially assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: No explicit Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided. The text merely speculates that “Gleason pisteytystä 3 olisi voinut ehkä havaita pienin määrin,” which is insufficient to derive a valid Gleason pattern or sum.  

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The Finnish contains several spelling/typing errors (“tusinam grammaa”, “oelvaa”, “väitetysti”) and awkward phrasing that obscure meaning. While a layman might grasp the gist, the numerous orthographic and grammatical issues significantly hinder comprehension.
