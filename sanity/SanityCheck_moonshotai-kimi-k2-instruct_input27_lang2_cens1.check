#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “vävnadmaterial från prostata” (tissue material from the prostate) and refers to batches, which implies a fragmented specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that the growth pattern “inte följde normal prostatacancer differentiering” (did not follow normal prostate-cancer differentiation) and that any possible Gleason 3 would only be found “i små mängder” (in small amounts). This wording indicates that no clear malignant (adenocarcinoma) finding was confirmed; instead, the findings are described as atypical or borderline at most.  

#5: No  
#6: Although the phrase “diskutabelt Gleason grad 3” is used, it is immediately qualified as “i små mängder” and “inte följde normal … differentiering.” No major or minor Gleason pattern is assigned, and no sum score is provided or can be reliably inferred.  

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The Swedish contains several grammatical and lexical errors that obscure meaning: “tillsammans dussen gram” should probably be “tillsammans ett dussin gram” (a dozen grams); “igångsatts” is not standard Swedish; “nög och näppe” appears to be a misspelling of “noga och nätt och jämt” (barely). These issues make the text hard to follow even for a lay reader.
