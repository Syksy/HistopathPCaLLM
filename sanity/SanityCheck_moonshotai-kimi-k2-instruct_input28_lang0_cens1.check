#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “six different sites of interest” and refers to “front left”, “middle left”, and “middle right”, which strongly implies a multi-site biopsy set. However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively confirmed.

#3: No  
#4: While atypical growth patterns and “possible pre-malignant changes” are described, the report explicitly states that material is being sent for further evaluation and that differentiation staging is “unclear”. No definitive malignant diagnosis (adenocarcinoma) is rendered; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement alone.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a lay reader. Minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “hyperlastic changes”) is acceptable in a pathology context.
