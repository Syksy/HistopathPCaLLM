#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “kuusi biopsialieriötä” (six biopsy cores), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported in three cores (adenocarcinoma with Gleason scores provided), while the remaining cores are described as benign (hyperplastic epithelial changes). Thus malignancy status is unambiguous.  

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are given for each positive core in the standard major+minor=sum format: 4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology; a lay reader might need clarification on terms like “graduksen 4 osuus,” but the overall level is appropriate for a pathology report.
