#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “Prostate was obtained as a fresh sample specimen” and describes systematic sampling from apex to base, but it never explicitly states whether the specimen is from a radical prostatectomy, TURP, or biopsy. The sampling pattern (multiple transverse planes with left/right lobes) is consistent with a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only inferred, not declared.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement clearly reports “invasive adenocarcinoma” in the left-lobe sections (cassettes A and C) and mentions additional malignant features such as capsular penetration and perineural invasion. Thus, malignancy is unambiguously established.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A total Gleason score of 7 is explicitly given (“SUMMARY: Score sum 7”). However, the individual pattern scores are ambiguous: the text states “mostly grade 4 differentiation pattern is observed, with the smaller portion as grade 4,” which is contradictory and does not allow reliable extraction of distinct primary and secondary grades (e.g., 4+3=7 or 3+4=7). Therefore, the exact major+minor breakdown cannot be determined.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues: “fused grandular structures” should read “fused glandular structures,” and “casettes” should be “cassettes.” Additionally, the phrase “with the smaller portion as grade 4” is redundant and confusing because both portions are described as grade 4. These issues do not render the text incomprehensible but could be improved for clarity.
