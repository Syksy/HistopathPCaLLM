#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly indicates that the specimen is a “prostata” (prostate) obtained “tuorenäytteenä” (as a fresh sample) and weighing ≈40 g. The description of systematic sectioning into apex-to-base blocks (A–F) is typical of a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is unambiguous.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states that “vasemman lohkon kaseteista A ja C havaitaan invasoivaa adenokarsinoomaa” (invasive adenocarcinoma is found in left-sided blocks A and C) with extraprostatic extension and perineural invasion. Thus, malignancy is clearly confirmed.

#5: Yes  
#6: The text mentions “eniten luokan 4 erilaistumista, ja pienempi luokka 3” (mostly grade 4 differentiation, lesser grade 3) and concludes with “Pistesumman 7 löydös” (Gleason score 7 finding). This directly translates to Gleason 4 + 3 = 7.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is standard medical language, easily understood by professionals and reasonably clear to an informed layperson. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
