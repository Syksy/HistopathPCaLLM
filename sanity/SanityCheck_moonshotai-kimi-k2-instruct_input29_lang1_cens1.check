#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “tuore prostatakudos materiaali” (fresh prostate tissue material) and describes how six separate specimens (A–F) were taken from defined anatomical sites. This strongly implies that the material is prostate biopsies, but the word “biopsies” itself is never used, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that the tissue in specimens A and C was “ei ollut prostatasta” (was not prostate tissue) and that capsular penetration, perineural invasion, or tumour differentiation could not be evaluated. No mention of carcinoma or any malignant finding is made; instead, it states that the intended evaluation could not be performed. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: The summary sentence “Pistesumman määrittäminen ei ollut mahdollista” (determination of the score sum was not possible) directly indicates that no Gleason score could be assigned.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable, but it contains a few spelling/grammar issues (e.g., “siiten” → “siten”, “kotheena” → “kohteena”, “erityiseti” → “erityisesti”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
