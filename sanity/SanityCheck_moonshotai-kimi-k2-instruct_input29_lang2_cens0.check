#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly describes the specimen as “fräschprov” (fresh specimen) and gives the weight of the prostate (≈40 g), indicating a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly reports “invasiv adenocarcinoma” in cassettes A and C, with additional malignant features such as capsular penetration and perineural invasion.  

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason score is provided (“Poängsum 7”), but only the total (7) is given. The major and minor pattern numbers (e.g., 4+3=7 or 3+4=7) are not separately stated; they can only be inferred from the description “mest klass 4 … mindre klass 3,” which suggests 4+3=7, but this is not explicitly written.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but contains a few spelling/typing errors (“häger lob” should be “höger lob,” “utställer” should probably be “upptäcks” or “visar,” “bäde” should be “både”). These do not prevent comprehension but are noticeable.
