#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly states “a fresh prostatectomy specimen,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states that all examined sections show “normal benign growth,” “no abnormal growth,” and “no tumor growth.” Therefore, the findings are confirmed benign.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignancy is present, Gleason grading is not applicable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is generally understandable and uses appropriate terminology for a pathology report. Minor wording issues such as “vehicles” instead of “seminal vesicles” and “resection are surfaces” instead of “resection margins” are present, but they do not impede comprehension.
