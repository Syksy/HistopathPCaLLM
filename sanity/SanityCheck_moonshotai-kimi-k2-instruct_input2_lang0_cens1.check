#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “autopsy specimen” and “fresh sample,” which implies the material is post-mortem tissue, but it does not explicitly state the organ (prostate) or the usual clinical specimen types (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly says that “further findings cannot be reliably inferred” and that the samples can be “only marginally utilized to characterize potential adenocarcinoma.” Thus, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be determined from the information provided.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information is given or can be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores are not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a layperson. Minor domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “macro/microsections,” “marker colours”) is acceptable within a pathology context and does not impede comprehension.
