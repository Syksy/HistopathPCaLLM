#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that the sample is derived from an autopsy specimen (“ruumiinavauksesta”), but it does not explicitly state the type of prostate specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that no conclusions can be drawn beyond atrophy and inflammation, and that additional studies are needed to evaluate possible adenocarcinoma or other malignancies. Hence, malignancy cannot be assessed from the current findings.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “lisätutkimuskia” should be “lisätutkimuksia”) are domain-typical and do not impede comprehension.
