#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikal prostatektomiprov” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that all examined sections show “normal, benign växt” and that resection margins, capsule and seminal vesicles are free of tumour (“rena av tumör växt”). Thus malignancy is explicitly ruled out.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is found, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains several minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g. “makrosnitter” should be “makroskopiska snitt”, “obduktion prov” → “obduktionsprov”, “avsedd” → “avsett”, “växt suggestiv av hyperplasi” → “vävnad suggestiv för hyperplasi”, “bekräftad rena” → “bekräftas rena”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but would benefit from polishing.
