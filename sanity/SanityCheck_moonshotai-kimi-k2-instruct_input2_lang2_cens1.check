#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that the material comes from an autopsy (“obduktion”) and is intended for research, but it does not explicitly name the specimen type in standard clinical terms (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states that no firm conclusion can be drawn because inflammation and age-related changes dominate. It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; it merely suggests that further sampling might be needed to assess a possible adenocarcinoma. Thus, the malignancy status is not assessable from this statement.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor described, no Gleason grading information is provided or can be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are not applicable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “frän vilken beställas”, “avslöjas”, “i materialet”). These do not prevent comprehension, but they are noticeable and could be improved for clarity.
