#1: No  
#2: The statement mentions “APPENDIX, ADDITIONAL CONSULTATION” but never specifies whether the tissue examined came from prostate biopsies, TURP chips, radical-prostatectomy, or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states that the experts “could not confirm or deny the suspicions” and that “the earlier uncertain diagnosis … could therefore not be determined.” Because malignancy status remains undetermined, it is impossible to assess whether malignant findings are present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy itself is unconfirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is clear and understandable; while the phrasing is slightly formal and the use of initials (“JD & JD”) is domain-specific, it remains comprehensible to a lay reader.
