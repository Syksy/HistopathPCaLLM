#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly mentions “lastuista” (chips), which in Finnish histopathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. Therefore the sample type is identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present, upgrading the diagnosis from “epävarma” (uncertain) to “keskitasoiseksi adenokarsinoomaksi” (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma).

#5: Yes  
#6: The grades are given directly: “erilaistumisluokkaa 4 (vallitseva) ja luokkaa 3, tertiäärinen 5.” This translates to a Gleason pattern 4 (major) + 3 (minor) = 7, with tertiary 5, corresponding to Grade Group 3.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional Finnish with only minor colloquialisms (“todelle” instead of “todella”). It is understandable to clinicians and, with minimal effort, to informed laypersons.
