#1: No  
#2: The statement does not mention the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). It only refers to “kudosnäyte” (tissue sample) without further specification, so the sample type cannot be determined.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states that the previous uncertain diagnosis could not be resolved and that malignancy could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. Therefore, the malignancy status remains undetermined.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy was not confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices such as “MM & MM” for the consultants’ initials are acceptable in clinical notes.
