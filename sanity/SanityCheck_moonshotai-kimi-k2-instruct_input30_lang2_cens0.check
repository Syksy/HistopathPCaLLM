#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “vävnadsspånor tagna nära urotelcellerna” (tissue shavings taken close to urothelial cells), which implies a biopsy or TURP-like sampling, but no explicit term such as “biopsi”, “TURP” or “radikal prostatektomi” is used. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not stated with certainty.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly upgrades the diagnosis to “medelhög adenokarcinom” (moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma) and assigns Grade Group 3, confirming malignancy.

#5: Yes  
#6: The updated Gleason pattern is given as “differentieringsgrad 4 (dominerande) och grad 3, med även tertiär grad 5”. Interpreting the dominant pattern as the primary grade (4) and the next most common as the secondary grade (3) yields 4+3=7, with tertiary 5 noted. This is sufficient to infer the standard Gleason score.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“medelhög adenokarcinom”, “vävnadsspånor”) and a few grammatical slips (“uppdateras patientens tidigare relativt osäkra diagnosis”). These do not impede comprehension but would benefit from minor polishing for clarity.
