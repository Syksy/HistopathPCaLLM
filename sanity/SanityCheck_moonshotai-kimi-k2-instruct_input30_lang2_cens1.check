#1: No  
#2: The statement mentions “vävnad” (tissue) but never specifies whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be determined.  

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states that the atypical findings could neither be confirmed nor ruled out as malignant, and that the previous uncertain diagnosis “kunde inte bestämmas”. Hence the malignancy status remains undetermined.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy itself is not confirmed, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a lay reader; only minor stylistic issues (e.g., “fyns” should be “fynd”, “åldersrelaterad förändringar” → “åldersrelaterade förändringar”) do not impede comprehension.
