#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “routine systematic biopsy” and “two targeted biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is biopsy material.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes malignant findings in both the initial biopsy (“minimal focus with Gleason 3+3=6”) and the second targeted biopsy (“large focus … primary differentiation pattern 4 … second most common differentiation pattern is 5”), confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.

#5: Partially  
#6: The initial biopsy gives a complete Gleason score (3+3=6). For the second targeted biopsy, only the primary pattern (4) and the second most common pattern (5) are stated; no explicit sum is provided. While one can reasonably infer a sum of 9 (4+5=9), the statement does not explicitly state this, so the assessment is only partial.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layman despite some domain-specific phrasing.
