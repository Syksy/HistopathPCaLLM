#1: No  
#2: The statement mentions that “samples were taken” after imaging, but it never specifies the type of tissue (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type cannot be assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only says “suspicious findings” and that “interpretation of tissue proved difficult.” It explicitly states that the findings are inconclusive and that additional samples are needed. Hence malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable to a lay reader, but contains small grammatical issues (“Patient undergone” should be “Patient has undergone,” “5 % ot” should be “5 % of,” etc.). These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
