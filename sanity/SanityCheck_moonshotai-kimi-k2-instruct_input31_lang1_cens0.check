#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “systeemibiopsiossa” (systematic biopsies) and later “targetoitua biopsiaa” (targeted biopsies), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes malignant findings in both rounds: first a minimal focus of Gleason 3+3=6, and later a large focus with pattern 4 and “vaikuttaa vahvasti kuitenkin että toiseksi yleisin kasvutapa 5” (strongly suggests pattern 5). Thus malignancy is confirmed.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The first biopsy gives a clear Gleason score (3+3=6). For the second biopsy the pathologist only describes “pääosin kasvutapaa 4” and “vaikuttaa vahvasti … kasvutapa 5”, without explicitly stating a combined score. We can infer a likely Gleason 4+5=9 or 5+4=9, but the exact major+minor=sum is not explicitly provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology understandable to clinicians. Minor colloquialisms (“potilas kuitenkin oireillut”, “vaikuttaa vahvasti kuitenkin”) are acceptable in clinical narrative and do not impede comprehension.
