#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that “näytteet” (samples) were taken after imaging, which implies a biopsy procedure, but it never explicitly states the sample type (e.g., needle biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement repeatedly uses vague phrases such as “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä” (suspicious findings) and “kudoksen tulkinta vaikeaa” (tissue interpretation difficult). It explicitly avoids confirming malignancy, instead stating that interpretation is inconclusive and additional sampling is required. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum scores) is provided, nor is there any basis for inferring such scores from the text.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable to a layperson. Domain-specific shorthand (e.g., “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä”) is acceptable in clinical notes.
