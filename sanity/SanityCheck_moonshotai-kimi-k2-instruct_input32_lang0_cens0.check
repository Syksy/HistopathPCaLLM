#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions that the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement confirms the presence of multifocal prostate adenocarcinoma in the original prostate tissue, so malignancy is clearly established.

#5: Partially  
#6: The statement lists several Gleason patterns (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3) observed in the prostate tissue, but it does not provide a single, definitive Gleason score (major+minor=sum) for the overall tumor. Instead, it describes multiple patterns, making it impossible to extract one definitive score.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is well-structured, grammatically correct, and uses terminology understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge.
