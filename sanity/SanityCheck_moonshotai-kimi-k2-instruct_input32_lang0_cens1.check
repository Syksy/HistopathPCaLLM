#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “original primary prostate tissue” and “lymph nodes and seminal vesicles,” which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement only says that “findings … remain” and that “lymph nodes and seminal vesicles … were clear.” It does not confirm whether prostate adenocarcinoma was present or absent; it merely reports that nodes and seminal vesicles were negative. Thus malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not mentioned and cannot be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is understandable and suitable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “from one sample to other”) do not impede comprehension.
