#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen, and it also refers to separately submitted lymph-node packets (samples 1 and 2) and seminal-vesicle samples (samples 3 and 4). Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report confirms that the original prostate contained multifocal adenocarcinoma (“multifokaalista adenokarsinoomasta”) and gives Gleason patterns for that tumour. The additional lymph-node and seminal-vesicle samples are explicitly stated to be benign (“puhtaat”, “normaalia solukkoa”, “löydökset benignejä”). Thus malignancy status is assessable.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason patterns (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3) are provided for the primary tumour, but no single summed score is given for any focus, nor is it stated which pattern is dominant. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be inferred unambiguously.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is fluent and uses standard medical terminology. A layperson might need clarification for some terms (e.g., “basiksestä” = “from the base”), but overall the statement is comprehensible and grammatically correct.
