#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “näytteet eri erissä” (samples in different batches) and gives lengths, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The mention of “alkuperäisestä prostatakudoksesta” (original prostate tissue) and “imusolmukkeet ja seminaalivesikkelit” (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles) suggests a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only inferred, not directly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only says “tutkimustulokset eroavat näytteestä toiseen” (results vary from sample to sample) and that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are “puhtaat” (clean). There is no explicit statement that malignant findings were present or absent in the prostate tissue itself.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which they could be reliably inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although it is written in a concise clinical style that may require some lay interpretation.
