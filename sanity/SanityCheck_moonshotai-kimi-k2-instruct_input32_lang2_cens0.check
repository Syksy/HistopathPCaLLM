#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen type, so the sample type is clearly identified.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report confirms the presence of a multifocal prostatic adenocarcinoma in the original prostatectomy specimen, so malignancy is clearly established.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Several Gleason patterns are listed (4+4, 3+3, 3+4, 4+3), but no single composite Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided for the overall tumour. Therefore the exact Gleason score cannot be fully inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable for a layman, although some medical terms (e.g., “seminalvehiklar”) may require brief explanation.
