#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “primär prostatavävnad” (primary prostate tissue) and “lymfkörtlar och seminalvesiklar” (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles), which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy-type specimen. However, no explicit term such as “radikal prostatektomi” is used, so the sample type is only partially ascertainable.  

#3: No  
#4: The text speaks of “forskningsresultat skiljar sig mellan proven” (research results differ between the samples) and “makroskopisk sektioner från primär prostatavävnad träder i kraft” (macroscopic sections from primary prostate tissue take effect), but it never states whether malignant or benign histopathological findings were present. Absence of any mention of cancer, adenocarcinoma, or benign diagnosis means malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which such scores could be inferred.  

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The Swedish contains grammatical and lexical issues: “batchar” is an anglicism; “längst” should be “längsta”; “ställer” should be “ställen”; “skiljar” should be “skiljer”; “träder i kraft” is awkward in this context; and overall phrasing is unclear. These errors hinder easy comprehension even for a lay reader.
