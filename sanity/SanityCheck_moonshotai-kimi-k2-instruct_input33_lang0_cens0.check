#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “growth pattern varies by Gleason types 3+4/4+3,” confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Additional evidence includes capsular penetration and a positive lymph-node finding (1/4, N1).  

#5: Partially  
#6: Two different Gleason patterns are reported (“3+4/4+3”), but no single definitive score (major+minor=sum) is given. One can infer that at least one focus is Gleason 3+4=7 and another is 4+3=7, yet the statement does not provide a single, unambiguous overall Gleason score for the case.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are minor grammatical issues: “preparate” should be “specimen” or “preparation,” “seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles,” and the phrase “View specific information from the additional details of the report” is awkward.
