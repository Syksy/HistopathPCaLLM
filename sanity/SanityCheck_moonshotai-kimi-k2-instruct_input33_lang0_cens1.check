#1: No  
#2: The statement never specifies what kind of tissue was examined (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). It only mentions “collected samples” and “processed samples” without naming the specimen type.

#3: No  
#4: While it explicitly says “No malignant findings in seminal vesicles,” it does not state whether the prostate tissue itself was examined or whether any prostate adenocarcinoma was found. The phrase “possibly abnormal findings in lymph nodes” is too vague to confirm or rule out malignancy.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which these could be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“seminal vehicles” should be “seminal vesicles”) and vague wording (“pathological findings vary”). These are minor issues that do not render the statement incomprehensible.
