#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikaalipostatetoktomian preparaatti”, i.e. a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that tumour has penetrated the capsule (“tuumori on läpäissyt kapselia”) and gives Gleason patterns (3+4/4+3), confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason patterns are provided as “3+4/4+3”, indicating two foci with Gleason 3+4=7 and 4+3=7. However, no single summed score is given for the entire tumour, so the exact major+minor=sum for the whole specimen cannot be unambiguously inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional medical Finnish, grammatically correct and understandable to a clinician or informed lay reader.
