#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions that “collected samples were processed according to normal protocol” and refers to “macro-sections processed from lymph nodes” and “seminal vesicles,” which implies the material is most likely a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The sentence “Ei maligneja löydöksiä seminaalivesikkeleissä” explicitly states that no malignant findings were present in the seminal vesicles. Although the report elsewhere mentions “abnormal findings in lymph-node macro-sections,” it does not contradict the absence of malignancy in the prostate/seminal-vesicle tissue. Therefore, malignancy status can be assessed as negative.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant findings are reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the level of language is suitable for a pathology report.
