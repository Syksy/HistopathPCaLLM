#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “Prostatektomipreparatet” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly mentions “Gleason typer 3+4/4+3” and “tumör har penetrat genom kapseln,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Two Gleason patterns are given (3+4 and 4+3), but the statement does not specify which one is the primary (major) pattern for the index tumour, nor does it provide a single summed Gleason score. Therefore the exact major+minor=sum triplet cannot be unambiguously extracted.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“igångsatts”, “kolla på mer precis ytterligare information från detalj”) and minor grammatical slips. A layman could grasp the gist, yet the wording could be clearer.
