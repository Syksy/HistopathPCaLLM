#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “a resection weighing 7.5 g” and “six tissue cassettes”, which strongly suggests a transurethral resection (TURP) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Findings do not indicate prostatic adenocarcinoma” and “no malignities”, so the absence of malignancy is clearly conveyed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy is ruled out, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable to a layman, with only minor stylistic quirks (“malignities” instead of “malignancies”).
