#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly mentions “7.5 g resekaattia” (resectate) and that 7 g of it was processed into six tissue cassettes. This identifies the specimen as a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “ei mitään malignia” and “ei viittaa eturauhasadenokarsinoomaan,” confirming that no malignant findings were present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor non-standard orthography (“resekaattia” instead of “resektaattia”) is acceptable in clinical notes.
