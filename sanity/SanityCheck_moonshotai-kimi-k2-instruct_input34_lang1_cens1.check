#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that the specimen was processed into six tissue cassettes, which implies a tissue sample (likely TURP or biopsy), but the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes cribriform growth, which is suspicious for prostate adenocarcinoma, but it explicitly denies malignancy ("löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen [syöpään]"). Thus, malignancy cannot be confirmed.  

#5: No  
#6: Since malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the phrase "löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen" is incomplete (missing "syöpään" or similar). Additionally, "histologiseseti" should be "histologisesti."
