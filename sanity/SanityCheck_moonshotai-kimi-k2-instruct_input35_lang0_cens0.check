#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly identifies the samples as “representative prostate biopsies from left and right lobe,” so the sample type is clearly stated.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states “No signs of carcinoma,” which directly conveys that no malignant findings were identified. High-grade PIN is noted, but PIN is not considered carcinoma.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not applicable; therefore no Gleason scores (major+minor=sum) can be provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear, concise, and easily understandable by a layman. Minor domain-specific terms (e.g., “high-grade PIN”) are acceptable in this context.
