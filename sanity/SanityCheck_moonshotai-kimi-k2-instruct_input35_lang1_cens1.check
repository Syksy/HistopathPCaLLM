#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “vasemmasta ja oikeasta lohkosta” (from the left and right lobes), which implies that the material comes from at least two separately labelled biopsy sites. However, it does not explicitly state the overall sample type (e.g. needle biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The findings describe “pieniä korkea-asteisia PIN-muutoksia” (small high-grade PIN lesions) and “hyperplasiaa” (hyperplasia). High-grade PIN is a premalignant change, not invasive carcinoma, and hyperplasia is benign. No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or other malignancy is present, so malignancy cannot be assessed as confirmed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no invasive carcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear, concise and uses standard medical terminology. A lay reader might need explanation of “PIN-muutoksia” and “hyperplasia”, but the statement itself is grammatically correct and understandable.
