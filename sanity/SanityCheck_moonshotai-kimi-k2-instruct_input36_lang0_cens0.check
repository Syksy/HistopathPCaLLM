#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “preparate” (specimen) and gives weight and dimensions (80 g, 7 × 6 × 5 cm), which are typical for a TURP or radical prostatectomy, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “No signs of malignity,” which clearly conveys that no malignant findings were present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard wording (“preparate” instead of “specimen,” “macro casettes” instead of “macro cassettes,” “malignity” instead of “malignancy”). These are minor domain-specific or spelling issues that do not impede comprehension.
