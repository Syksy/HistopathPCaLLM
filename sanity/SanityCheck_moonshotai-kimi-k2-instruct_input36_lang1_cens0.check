#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions the preparation of “8 macro-cassettes and 5 ordinary cassettes,” which implies a surgical specimen rather than needle biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (TURP, simple prostatectomy, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Maligniteettia … ei löydy” (“no malignancy is found”), so we can confidently conclude that the findings are benign.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, it is not applicable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “mikroskooppistesti” instead of “mikroskooppisesti”) are acceptable in routine pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
