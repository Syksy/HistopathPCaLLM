#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that 8 macro-cassettes and 5 ordinary cassettes were prepared, which implies a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The microscopic description explicitly says “ei kyetty luotettavasti arvioimaan” (“could not be reliably assessed”), so no definitive benign or malignant status is given.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy could not be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report.
