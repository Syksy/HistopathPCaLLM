#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “8 makrokasetter och 5 vanliga kasetter,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore, the information is only partially assessable.

#3: No  
#4: The microscopic description reports only epithelial hyperplasia and explicitly states that malignancy “kunde inte bedömas tillförlitligt” (could not be reliably assessed). Thus, no malignant findings are confirmed, nor is benign status definitively established.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable for a professional reader. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “preparat typisk” could be “preparatets vikt och storlek är typiska”) do not impede comprehension.
