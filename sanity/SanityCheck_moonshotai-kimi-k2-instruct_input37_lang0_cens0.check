#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “electrosection chippings” clearly indicates that the material is transurethral resection (TURP) chippings, so the sample type can be assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly mentions only benign changes (“nodular gland components”, “hyperplasia”) and does not mention any malignant findings such as prostate adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is concise and understandable; “preparate” is slightly non-standard but acceptable in pathology reports.
