#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “elektrosektiolastuja” (electro-resection chips), which is a standard way of referring to TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) material. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: No  
#4: The histological description only mentions hyperplastic changes (“hyperplasia”) and mild inflammation. There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any other malignant finding, so malignancy cannot be assessed as present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is concise and uses standard histopathological terminology. It is understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons, with only minor domain-specific phrasing that does not hinder comprehension.
