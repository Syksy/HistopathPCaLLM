#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that “less than half of the possible specimen material” was processed, which implies a biopsy or TURP-type specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The histological description only notes “prostate tissue with partly nodular glandular components” and “slight inflammation.” There is no mention of carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, PIN, or any malignant finding. The report explicitly says that a more detailed examination will be done next week, so malignancy status is not assessed in this statement.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “histologisessa tarkastelussa” and “vähäistä inflammaatiota.” Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Alle puolet mahdollisesta näytemateriaalista valmisteltuna”) are acceptable in a pathology context and do not impede comprehension.
