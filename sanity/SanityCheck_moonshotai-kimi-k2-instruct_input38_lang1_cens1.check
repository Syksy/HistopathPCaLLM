#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “edustavia kudosnäytteitä” (representative tissue samples) and gives their total length in millimetres, which implies a biopsy set. However, it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The histological findings are described as “hyperplastista prostatakudosta, jossa kroonista inflammaatiota” (hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation). There is no mention of adenocarcinoma or any malignant process, so malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and concise, using standard medical terminology. A layman might need explanation of “hyperplastista” and “inflammaatiota,” but the grammar and level of understanding are appropriate for a pathology report.
