#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “a prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “a tumor with 3 foci” was found and describes the differentiation stages as “Gleason 3 (major) and 4 … therefore Gleason grade is 7.” This confirms the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The wording “Gleason 3 (major) and 4 … therefore Gleason grade is 7” directly translates to Gleason 3+4=7.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “preparate” instead of “specimen,” “run according to normal routine”). These quirks do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
