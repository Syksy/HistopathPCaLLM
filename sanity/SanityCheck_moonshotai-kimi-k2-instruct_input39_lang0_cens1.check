#1: No  
#2: The text mentions “some slices extracted” and “remaining tissue,” but it never specifies whether the specimen came from biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or any other source. Therefore the sample type cannot be determined.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “it is not clear whether there is benign hyperplasia or malignant findings.” Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status is unassessable.  

#5: No  
#6: The text states “Gleason score cannot be assessed at this point,” so no Gleason information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable to a lay reader despite the slightly informal phrasing (“run according to normal routine”). No major grammatical errors impede comprehension.
