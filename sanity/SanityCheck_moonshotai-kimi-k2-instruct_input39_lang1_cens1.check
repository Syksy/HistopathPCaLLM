#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that “a sample” is being examined and that “the remaining tissue is processed according to normal protocol,” but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: No  
#4: The pathologist explicitly writes that “no clarity was obtained as to whether benign hyperplasia or something malignant is present.” This means malignancy status remains undetermined; hence malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: The report states that “Gleason score could not be determined,” so no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is available.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report, even though it is concise and slightly informal (“ei selvyyttä”). No major linguistic errors are present.
