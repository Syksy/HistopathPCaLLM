#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and describes standard handling (macro-sections, embedding), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “tumör i tre foci” was found, confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives both Gleason patterns 3 and 4 and states the sum is 7, but it does not explicitly state the major and minor pattern in the standard “3+4=7” or “4+3=7” format. One can reasonably infer that pattern 3 is the major (it is called “vanligaste”), yet the exact notation is missing.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard histopathological phrasing; minor stylistic issues (e.g., “igångsätts enlight” should be “enligt”) do not impede comprehension.
