#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate chippings,” which is a clear indication that the specimen is a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The sentence “Nothing indicating malignancy is found” unequivocally states that no malignant changes were detected; therefore, the malignancy status can be assessed as benign.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and thus cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are small grammatical issues: “is started on one casette” should read “is submitted in one cassette,” and “spotted chronic inflammation is apparently” should be “focal chronic inflammation is apparent.” These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
