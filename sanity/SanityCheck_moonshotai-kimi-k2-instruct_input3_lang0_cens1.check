#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate material” and “a single run,” which strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, RP, etc.). Therefore the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “nothing conclusive may be derived” and does not report any malignant or benign findings. Because the examination is inconclusive, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant and therefore not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear and understandable, although “run” is an informal term for a histopathology report. No major grammatical errors impede comprehension.
