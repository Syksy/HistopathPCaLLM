#2: The phrase “spånor” (chips) together with the weight “12.3 g” clearly indicates that the specimen is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “Ses ingenting som indikerar malignitet” (“Nothing indicating malignancy is seen”), which definitively conveys that no malignant findings were present.

#6: Because no malignancy was found, no Gleason grading was performed or reported; therefore the Gleason score is not applicable.  

#7: Appropriate
