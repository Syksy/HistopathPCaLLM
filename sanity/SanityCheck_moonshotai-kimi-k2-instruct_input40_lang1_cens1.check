#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “8.9 g materiaalista” and “8 kasetillista”, which implies a TURP-type specimen (transurethral resection), but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement only reports “hyperplasia” and “inflammaatiota” (inflammation) and explicitly says “mahdollisesti jotain muutakin” and “vaatii jatkotutkimuksia”. No malignant diagnosis is given, so malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the sentence structure is slightly fragmented (e.g., “......” and “mutta mahdollisesti jotain muutakin”). Minor polishing would improve clarity for a lay reader.
