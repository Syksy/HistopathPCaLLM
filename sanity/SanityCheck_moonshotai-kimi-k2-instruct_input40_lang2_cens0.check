#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the material as “hyvling” (TURP – transurethral resection) and gives its weight and cassette distribution, so the sample type is unambiguous.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that no atypia or infiltrative epithelium is seen and concludes with “Godartad prostatahyperplasi” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Thus, malignancy status is clearly assessed as absent.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; minor domain-specific abbreviations (e.g., “ca” for “cirka”) are acceptable. No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
