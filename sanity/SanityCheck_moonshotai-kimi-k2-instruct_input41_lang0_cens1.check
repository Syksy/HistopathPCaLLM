#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “samples … from left and right lobes of prostate,” which implies a biopsy setting, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (e.g., needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says it is “hard to determine whether there is any cancer related changes or not,” so no malignant findings are confirmed. The description only lists benign changes (chronic inflammation, atrophic glands). Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy is identified, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable to a lay reader; no significant errors are present.
