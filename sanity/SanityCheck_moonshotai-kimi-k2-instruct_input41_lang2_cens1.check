#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that samples were taken from the left and right lobes of the prostate, which implies a biopsy, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (e.g., biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy).  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says it is difficult to determine whether the samples contain cancer-related changes, meaning malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason scores are not provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The grammar is mostly understandable, but there are minor issues: "En prov" should be "Ett prov" (neuter gender), and "atrofierad körtlar" should be "atrofierade körtlar" (plural adjective agreement).
