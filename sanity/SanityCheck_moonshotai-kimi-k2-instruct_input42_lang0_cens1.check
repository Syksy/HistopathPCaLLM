#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “Prostate sample weighing app 8?” suggests a radical-prostatectomy specimen (because weight is typically recorded for whole prostates), but the wording is vague and the question mark makes it uncertain.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states that it “cannot be determined” whether the observed changes are cancer or inflammation, so malignancy status is indeterminate.  

#5: No  
#6: Since malignancy itself cannot be confirmed, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The sentence structure is understandable, but “weighing app 8?” is non-standard and should read “weighing approximately 8 g” or similar.
