#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “prostatanäyte” clearly indicates that the specimen is from the prostate, but it does not specify whether it is a biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, or another type of sample. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that it cannot be determined whether the findings represent cancer or inflammation. Consequently, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is understandable and grammatically acceptable for a lay reader. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “8?” for weight) are acceptable in clinical shorthand.
