#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “prostataprov” clearly indicates a prostate specimen, but the exact type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not specified.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Det kan dock inte bestämmas om fynd är cancer eller inflammation,” i.e., it cannot be determined whether the findings are cancer or inflammation. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable, but “cirka 8?” is incomplete (missing unit), and “en liten område” should be “ett litet område.”
