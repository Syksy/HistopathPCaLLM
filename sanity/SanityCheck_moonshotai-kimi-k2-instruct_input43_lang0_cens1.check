#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and “placed in cassettes and in the jar,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen, but the exact sample type is not explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly says “no decision regarding cancerous changes can be reached,” so malignancy status remains undetermined.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable to a lay reader; minor stylistic issues (“in the jar”) are acceptable in routine pathology reports.
