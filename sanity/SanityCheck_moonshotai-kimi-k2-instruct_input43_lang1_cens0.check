#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “about 30 g of prostate chips” (prostatalastuja), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states that “nothing suggestive of prostatic adenocarcinoma is found,” thereby confirming benign findings.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignancy is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores are not assessable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and grammatically correct for a pathology report; lay readers might need explanation of “prostatalastuja” and “atrofiouituneita,” but the statement is otherwise easily understood.
