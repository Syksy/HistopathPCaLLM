#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytteitä” (prostate samples) and that the material was placed in cassettes and a jar, which implies a histopathology specimen. However, it does not explicitly state the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “ei päästä johtopäätöksiin syöpään liittyvistä muutoksista” (no conclusions can be drawn regarding cancer-related changes). This indicates that malignancy status cannot be assessed from the findings.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason grading is not applicable in this context.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and phrasing are clear and understandable, though slightly informal ("purkkiin"). It conveys the intended message effectively without major issues.
