#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “Representative prostate samples according to standard routine” suggests that the material is prostate tissue taken for diagnostic purposes, but it does not explicitly state whether the samples are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly says “Nothing can be concluded regarding malignant changes.” This means the current examination neither confirms nor rules out malignancy. Consequently, the malignancy status cannot be assessed from this statement alone.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no malignant findings are confirmed in the current examination, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear and understandable to a lay reader. Minor stylistic issues (“inflamation” should be “inflammation”; “atrophy” could read “focal atrophy”) do not impede comprehension.
