#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsiota” (prostate biopsies) and refers to “aiemmissa biopsioissa” (previous biopsies), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “ei nähdä ollenkaan kasvainkudosta” (no tumour tissue is seen at all) and “ei mitään epäilyttävää” (nothing suspicious). Thus, the findings are benign.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant tissue is identified in the current sample, Gleason grading is not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable; the terminology is standard for a pathology report and should be clear to a lay reader with minimal medical knowledge.
