#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “edustavia prostatanäytteitä” (representative prostate samples) and refers to “aiemmissa biopsioissa” (previous biopsies), clearly indicating that the material examined consists of prostate biopsies.  

#3: No  
#4: The report states that no malignant changes can be concluded (“Maligneihin muutoksiin liittyen ei voida päätellä mitään”). Therefore, the current examination does not confirm malignancy; it only notes benign findings with chronic inflammation and focal atrophy.  

#5: No  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported in the current examination, no Gleason score is provided or inferable. The mention of prostate cancer in previous biopsies does not supply the required Gleason information for the current samples.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to professionals and laypersons alike.
