#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “nu hittas alltså ingen tumörvävnad” (no tumour tissue is now found) and that only benign changes (atrophy, chronic inflammation) are present. Therefore malignancy status is assessable and the finding is benign.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant tissue is identified in the current biopsies, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable; Gleason scores are only relevant when adenocarcinoma is present.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is clear, concise and easily understandable even to a layman; only minor colloquial phrasing (“ju”) is used, which is acceptable in clinical notes.
