#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “whole prostatectomy preparate,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.

#3: Yes  
#4: The presence of “fusing tumor tissue focus,” “classes 3+4,” and “perineural invasion” unequivocally indicates malignant findings (prostate adenocarcinoma).

#5: Yes  
#6: The text states “classes 3+4” and “tissue gleason 3,” from which the Gleason score can be inferred as 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2). Although the wording is slightly non-standard (“classes” instead of “pattern”), the intended major and minor grades are unambiguous.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are small grammatical and terminological issues: “preparate” should be “specimen,” “tissue gleason 3” should read “tissue Gleason grade 3,” and “negative marginals” should be “negative margins.” These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
