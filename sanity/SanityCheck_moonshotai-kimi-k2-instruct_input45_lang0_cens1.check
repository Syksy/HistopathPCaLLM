#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “a suspect prostate sample” and lists middle sections (E, F, G) as well as sections O and P, implying a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement repeatedly stresses that the structure is “unclear,” “not able to detect,” and that “further inspection is needed.” No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: Because no cancer diagnosis is confirmed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is given or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “capsel” should be “capsule,” “marginals” should be “margins,” and some sentences are slightly awkward). These do not prevent comprehension but could be improved for clarity.
