#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäyte” (prostate sample) and that it was processed routinely, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as a prostate specimen, but not the exact type.  

#3: No  
#4: The findings are described as “epäselvä ja vaikeatulkintainen” (unclear and difficult to interpret), and no definitive statement of malignancy or benignity is provided. The mention of “negatiiviset marginaalit” (negative margins) and “ei metastaaseja” (no metastases) does not confirm malignancy, as these could also apply to benign conditions. Thus, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: Since no definitive diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given, no Gleason score (major+minor=sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but some phrasing is slightly awkward (e.g., “kudosfokuksen” could be clearer as “kudosfokus”). The term “seminalvesikkelit” is correctly used, but overall, the language is slightly technical for a layman.
