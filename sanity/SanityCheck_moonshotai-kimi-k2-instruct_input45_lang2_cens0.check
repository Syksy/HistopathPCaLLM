#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “total prostatektomipreparat” (total prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text describes a “sammanflytande tumorvävnads fokus” (confluent tumour tissue focus) and assigns Gleason pattern “klasser 3+4”, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The phrase “klasser 3+4” directly gives the major and minor Gleason patterns, and their sum is 7. Thus Gleason 3+4=7 can be inferred unambiguously.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “klasser 3+4” instead of “Gleason 3+4”). A lay reader can grasp the key facts without difficulty.
