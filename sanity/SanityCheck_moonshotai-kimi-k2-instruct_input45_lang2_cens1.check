#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and describes processing “enligt rutin” (according to routine), but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). The reference to “kapsel hel” (capsule intact) and “områdes lymfkörtlar” (regional lymph nodes) hints at a radical prostatectomy, yet this is only an inference, not a clear statement.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes a “sammanflytande vävnadfokus” with glandular structures that are “svår att tolka” and “struktur oklar”. While the findings are called “suspekt” (suspicious), no definitive diagnosis of malignancy is given. The possibility of cancer is raised but not confirmed, so malignancy status remains uncertain.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can any Gleason information be inferred from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “materialet av mitten” should probably be “materialet från mitten”; “i fokus mest av körtelstrukturer” is awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but polishing would improve clarity.
