#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “shaved prostate chippings,” which is a clear description of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. The total weight (~20 g) and the fact that the material was set on eight cassettes further confirm this sample type.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “No signs of prostate cancer in the material,” which directly indicates that malignant findings were absent. The only described findings are benign (regular prostate tissue and basal cell hyperplasia).  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) can be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable. Minor stylistic points: “run” could be replaced with “processed,” and “gland findings coincide with basal cell hyperplasia” might read more smoothly as “glandular changes consistent with basal cell hyperplasia,” but these are small issues that do not impede comprehension.
