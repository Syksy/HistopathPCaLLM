#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “höylättyjen eturauhaslastujen kudosmateriaali” (chips from transurethral resection of the prostate, i.e. TURP), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Ei löydetä eturauhassyöpää materiaalista” (no prostate cancer is found) and describes only benign findings (regular prostatic tissue with basal-cell hyperplasia). Thus malignancy status is unambiguously assessed as negative.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to a lay reader.
