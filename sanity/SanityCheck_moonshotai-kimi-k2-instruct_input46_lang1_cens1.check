#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “eturauhasmateriaali” (prostate material) and that it was placed in cassettes and partly sectioned, which implies a biopsy or resection specimen, but the exact type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “ei voitu määrittää, onko syöpään liittyviä muutoksia vai ei” (it could not be determined whether cancer-related changes are present). Thus, malignancy status remains unconfirmed.  

#5: No  
#6: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard medical terminology. No significant grammatical errors impede comprehension.
