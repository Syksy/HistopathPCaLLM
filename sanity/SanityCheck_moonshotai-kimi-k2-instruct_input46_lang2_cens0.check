#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “hyvlingsprostataspån” (literally “shavings of prostate chips”) clearly indicates that the specimen is a TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) sample.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Ingen prostatacancer kommer inte fram” (double negative, but the intended meaning is “no prostate cancer is found”). Thus malignancy status can be assessed as negative/benign.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable, but it contains a double negative (“Ingen … inte”) and a slightly awkward phrase “i gång en mindre del av materialet”. A clearer wording would be “en mindre del av materialet bearbetas” or similar.
