#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatamaterial” and describes its handling (“sätts i kasetter”), which implies it is some form of prostate tissue specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The pathologist explicitly writes “Kunde inte bestämmas finns det cancerrelaterad förändringar” (“It could not be determined whether cancer-related changes are present”). This means malignancy status is undetermined, so we cannot assess whether malignant findings are present.  

#5: No  
#6: Since malignancy could not be determined, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical issues: “en mindre del av materialet igång” is awkward (likely meant “en mindre del av materialet används” or similar); “kunde inte bestämmas finns det” should be “kunde det inte bestämmas om det finns”. These are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
