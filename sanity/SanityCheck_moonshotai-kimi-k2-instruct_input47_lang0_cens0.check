#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “biopsies” and specifies their origin (“right” and “left”), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as prostate needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “No malign findings on the left or the right,” which directly conveys that no malignant tissue was identified; hence the malignancy status is assessable as benign.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason score can or should be provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and largely correct. The only minor deviation is the spelling “lymfocytic” instead of “lymphocytic,” which is a trivial orthographic variation and does not impede comprehension.
