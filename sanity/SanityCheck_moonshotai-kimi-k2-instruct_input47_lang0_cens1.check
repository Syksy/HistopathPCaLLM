#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatic material” and refers to “right and the left,” which implies a paired‐side specimen typical of needle biopsies. However, the exact specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so only a partial assessment is possible.

#3: No  
#4: The pathologist explicitly writes “Not able to determine whether there is malign findings on the left or the right.” This directly negates any ability to assess malignancy status; the findings are inconclusive rather than benign.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy cannot be confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. Therefore, Gleason scores are not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is understandable and largely correct. Minor non-standard phrasing such as “malign findings” instead of “malignant findings” is acceptable in pathology reports.
