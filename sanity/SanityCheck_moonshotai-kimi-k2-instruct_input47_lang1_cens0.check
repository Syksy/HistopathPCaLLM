#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “kolme biopsiapalaa oikealta ja kolme palaa vasemmalta” (three biopsy cores from the right and three from the left), so the sample type is clearly identified as prostate biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Ei maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla eikä oikealla puolella” (no malignant findings on either side), which directly conveys that no malignancy was detected.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, no Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are clear and understandable. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Tutkitaan” instead of “Tutkitussa näytteessä”) are acceptable in clinical Finnish and do not hinder comprehension.
