#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “eturauhasmateriaalia” (prostate material) from right and left sides and gives a total length of “30 + 40 = 70 mm”, which is consistent with needle-biopsy cores. However, the exact sample type (biopsy vs TURP vs prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.  

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly says “Ei voida määrittää onko maligneja löydöksiä vasemmalla tai oikealla” (“It cannot be determined whether there are malignant findings on the left or right”). Therefore malignancy status is unassessable from the statement.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score is provided or inferable; the question is therefore not applicable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear, grammatically correct, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to both professionals and informed laypersons.
