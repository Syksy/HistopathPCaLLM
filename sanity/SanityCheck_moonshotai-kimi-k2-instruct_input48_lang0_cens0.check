#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “prostate resection” (radical prostatectomy) and describes the systematic sampling of apex, middle, base, and seminal vesicles.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states that “adenocarcinoma” was found in two macro sections, lists tumor locations, and notes adverse features such as capsule invasion and perineural growth.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The text gives the two most common Gleason patterns for each focus (4+3 and 5+4) and explicitly concludes with “Gleason 9 tumor,” which corresponds to the sum of the highest-grade focus (5+4=9).  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is clear, but there are small grammatical issues (“accourding” → “according”; “first discovered tumor focus' most common Gleason” → “first discovered tumor focus’s most common Gleason pattern”). These do not impede comprehension.
