#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate sample material obtained from multiple autopsies” and describes the preparation of apex, middle, base and seminal vesicles on separate cassettes, which clearly identifies the sample type as autopsy prostate tissue.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text states that “some exemplifying histological changes are seen” and calls them “interesting findings,” but it neither confirms nor denies malignancy; it only rules out deriving differentiation scores. Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: The summary explicitly says “this is not used to derive differentiation scores (i.e. Gleason 1-5),” so no Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) can be extracted.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear and understandable despite the parenthetical “(?)” and the slightly informal phrase “interesting patterns.” It conveys the intended message to a lay reader without major grammatical errors.
