#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostataresekaatti” (prostate resection specimen) and describes the slicing routine (apex, mid-section, basis, seminal vesicles), which clearly identifies the sample type as a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “histologisesti löydetään adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma is found histologically) and lists malignant features such as capsular invasion and perineural growth. Therefore, malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives the most common and second-most common Gleason patterns for each focus (first focus: 4 and 3; second focus: 5 and 4). However, it does not explicitly state the combined Gleason score (major + minor = sum) for each separate focus. Instead, it provides a summary “Gleason 9 kasvain,” which can be inferred as the highest overall score, but the individual focus scores are not fully specified in the required format.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable, using standard Finnish histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “ensin löydetyssä kasvainfokuksessa”) are acceptable within the domain and do not hinder comprehension.
