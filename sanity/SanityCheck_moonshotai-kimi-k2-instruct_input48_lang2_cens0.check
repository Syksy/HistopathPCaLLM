#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a prostate resection (“resekat”) and describes the preparation of tissue blocks from apex, mid-gland, base and seminal vesicles, which is typical for a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that adenocarcinoma is found in the base of the prostate, with capsular invasion and perineural growth, confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives the most common and second-most common Gleason patterns for each tumour focus:  
- First focus: 4 + 3 = 7  
- Second focus: 5 + 4 = 9 (with >80 % Gleason 5)  
The summary also states “Gleason 9 tumör”, which is consistent with the highest-grade focus.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and professional, using standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “nästvanligaste”) are acceptable within the domain and do not hinder understanding.
