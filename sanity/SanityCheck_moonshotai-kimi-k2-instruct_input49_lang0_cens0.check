#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly indicates that the material examined consists of “prostate chippings” and “90 shavings on 8 glasses,” which is typical terminology for TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimens.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that “5 shavings contained carcinoma,” confirming the presence of malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason pattern information is given qualitatively (“most common Gleason class is 3, second most common Gleason class is 4”), which allows us to infer a Gleason score of 3+4=7. However, the exact major and minor pattern assignments are not explicitly stated in the standard format, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is concise and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (“rest of the prostate chippings”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not hinder comprehension.
