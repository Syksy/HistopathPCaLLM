#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “rest of the prostate samples on 8 glasses” implies that the material is prostate tissue cut onto eight slides, but it does not explicitly state whether the source is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement mentions “some changes that warrant further investigation” but does not confirm malignancy (adenocarcinoma) or benignity. Because the findings are explicitly deferred due to technical limitations, no conclusion about malignancy can be drawn.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the vague description of “some changes.”  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable to a layman; grammar is acceptable despite the slightly informal “fifth glass” instead of “fifth slide.”
