#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteistä” (prostate samples) and “lasilla” (slides), which implies the material is histological sections from prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only says that “joitakin muutoksia” (some changes) were seen and that “jatkotutkimuksia” (further investigations) are needed. It explicitly states that “arviointi ei ole mahdollista” (evaluation is not possible) due to technical limitations. Thus, no information is given about whether the findings are malignant or benign.  

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although slightly informal (“juuri nyt”). It is suitable for a layman or non-specialist reader.
