#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “hyvligns-spånen från prostata” clearly indicates trans-urethral resection (TURP) chips, so the sample type is identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “carcinom i 5 spånor”, confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The statement gives the most common Gleason grade as 3 and the second most common as 4, from which one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. However, it does not explicitly state the score in the standard “major + minor = sum” format, so the information is only partially complete.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable, but “hyvligns-spånen” should be written as “hyvelspånen” (correct Swedish spelling).
