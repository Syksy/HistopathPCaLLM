#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “several sampling sites from standard locations,” which implies a multi-site biopsy, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly says the material is “insufficient to reliably assess the content for presence of adenocarcinoma or PIN-like changes.” Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out, the malignancy status remains unassessable.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason scores are provided or inferable. The statement does not mention any cancer diagnosis, so Gleason grading is not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and vocabulary are clear and professional. While a layman might need to look up “adenocarcinoma” or “PIN-like changes,” the overall phrasing is understandable and free of major errors.
