#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and refers to “prov 1-6” (samples 1-6), clearly indicating that the material consists of multiple needle biopsies taken from typical locations.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “Man hittar inte carcinoma eller PIN-förändring” (no carcinoma or PIN changes are found). This unambiguously conveys that no malignant findings were present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no carcinoma was detected, no Gleason grading was performed or reported. Therefore, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a few grammatical and spelling issues: “trädje” should be “tredje”, “represerande” should be “representativa”, and “Det också finns inte” should be “Det finns inte heller”. These errors do not prevent comprehension but slightly detract from clarity.
