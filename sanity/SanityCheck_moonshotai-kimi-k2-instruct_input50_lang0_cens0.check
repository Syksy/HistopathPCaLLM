#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Needle biopsies”, which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported: “Gleason 3+4” and “3+3 differentiation” are stated for several biopsy cores, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are given directly in the standard major+minor=sum format: “3+4” (sum 7) and “3+3” (sum 6). Additional descriptive details (e.g., cribriform pattern) do not prevent extraction of the scores.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “differentiation” instead of “Gleason score”) are acceptable in the domain and do not hinder comprehension.
