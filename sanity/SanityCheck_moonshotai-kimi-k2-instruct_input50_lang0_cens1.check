#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samples” and “glasses” (glass slides) but does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). The mention of “right” and “left” suggests a bilateral procedure, most likely needle biopsies, yet this is only inferred, not explicitly declared.  

#3: No  
#4: The phrase “differentiation was found” is ambiguous; it is unclear whether it refers to malignant differentiation or simply tissue differentiation. The final sentence “Cannot determine the findings” explicitly states that malignancy cannot be confirmed. Therefore malignancy status is not assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but uses non-standard phrasing such as “changes of length 8/12 mm” and “differentiation was found” without clear context. Rewriting for clarity (e.g., “In one core 8 mm of 12 mm shows altered differentiation”) would improve lay comprehension.
