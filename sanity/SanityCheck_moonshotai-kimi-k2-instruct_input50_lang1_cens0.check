#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “neulabiopsioita” (needle biopsies) and lists individual biopsies (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B), so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported in the right-sided biopsies (Gleason 3+4 and 3+3), while the left-sided biopsies are explicitly described as benign. Thus malignancy status is assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are given directly as 3+4=7 and 3+3=6, satisfying the required format.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable to a layman, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “lasissa 1A” (should probably be “laseissa 1A”), “noni” (likely intended “noin”), and slightly awkward phrasing like “3+4 rakenteesta noni 60 % Gleason 3”. These do not impede comprehension but could be polished.
