#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “nålbiopsier” (needle biopsies), which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported in the right-sided biopsies: Gleason 3+4 and Gleason 3+3 are both stated, confirming the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The left-sided biopsies are explicitly described as benign.  

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are given directly as 3+4 and 3+3, from which the sums (7 and 6) can be inferred. Additional architectural details are provided, but the essential major + minor = sum format is already present.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable, using standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “cirka 60 % Gleason 3”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
