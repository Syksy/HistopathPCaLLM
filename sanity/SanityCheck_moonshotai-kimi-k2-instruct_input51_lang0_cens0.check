#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy preparate as sample,” which clearly identifies the specimen type as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Microscopic examination reveals tumor tissue … Adenocarcinoma in both lobes,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives the dominant pattern as Gleason 4 and the next most common as Gleason 5, with pattern 5 occupying ≈10 % of the surface. However, it does not provide the standard major + minor = sum format (e.g., 4+5=9 or 5+4=9). Therefore, while the Gleason patterns are described, the exact major/minor scores cannot be definitively extracted.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and largely appropriate, although “preparate” is non-standard (should be “specimen” or “preparation”). Minor stylistic issues like “builds separate, varying formations” could be phrased more smoothly, but overall the statement is comprehensible to both professionals and informed laypersons.
