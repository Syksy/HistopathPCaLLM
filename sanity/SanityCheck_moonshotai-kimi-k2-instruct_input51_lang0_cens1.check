#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “samples are prepared into cassettes” and refers to “both lobes” and “entire surface,” which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the actual word “biopsy,” “TURP,” or “radical prostatectomy” is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly assessed.

#3: No  
#4: Although the description speaks of “invasive” gland-forming structures occupying ≈20 % of the surface, the sentence “due to the contamination unable to determine the nature of changes” explicitly negates any definitive malignant diagnosis. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can it be inferred, because the report explicitly declares itself unable to determine the nature of the changes.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains small grammatical slips (“in to cassettes” should be “into cassettes”; “some finding” should probably be “some findings”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
