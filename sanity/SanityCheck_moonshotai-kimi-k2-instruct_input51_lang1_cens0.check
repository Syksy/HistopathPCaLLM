#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “radikaali prostatektomiapreparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the type of material is unambiguous.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “Adenokarsinoomaa molemmissa lohkoissa” (adenocarcinoma in both lobes), confirming malignant findings.

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives the dominant Gleason grade as 4 and the next most common as 5, with grade 5 comprising about 10 % of the tumour surface. This allows us to infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9 (or 5+4=9 if the pattern distribution were reversed), but the exact major and minor pattern numbers are not spelled out in the standard “X+Y=Z” format, hence only partial assessment is possible.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in professional Finnish with standard medical terminology. While a layperson might need some terms explained (e.g., “neoadjuvanttihoidot”), the grammar and clarity are appropriate for a pathology report.
