#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomipreparat,” which clearly identifies the sample as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “Adenikarcinom finns i båda loberna,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant Gleason grade is given as 4 and the secondary grade as 5, but no explicit sum (e.g., 4+5=9) is provided. From the wording one can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 9 (4+5), yet it is not stated outright, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “huvudakligen” instead of “huvudsakligen”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
