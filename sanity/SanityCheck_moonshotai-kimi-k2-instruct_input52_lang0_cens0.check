#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “prostate shaving” clearly indicates that the specimen consists of transurethral resection (TURP/TUR-B) chippings; the mention of “chippings” and “weight around 10.5 g after fixation” further confirms the sample type.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states “Gleason 3 and 4 differentiation seen” and describes “fused cribriform glands,” which are hallmarks of adenocarcinoma. Although the word “suspect” is used, the subsequent histological description and Gleason grading confirm malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The text gives both Gleason patterns (3 and 4) and indicates that pattern 4 is “slightly more common,” so we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+3=7. However, the exact major/minor assignment is not spelled out in the standard “major+minor=sum” format, hence only partial assessment is possible.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable and largely appropriate for a pathology report. Minor stylistic issues (“Class 4 slightly more common” should probably read “Grade 4 slightly more common”) do not impede comprehension.
