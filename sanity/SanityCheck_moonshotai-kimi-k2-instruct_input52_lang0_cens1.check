#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “Samples obtained through prostate samples” is awkward, but it clearly indicates that the material comes from the prostate. However, it does not specify whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue, so the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report mentions “small suspect findings” and describes “fused cribriform glands,” which are morphological features compatible with prostate adenocarcinoma. Yet it explicitly states that “due to the contamination of sample unable to determin the changes,” so malignancy cannot be definitively confirmed or ruled out.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can any be reliably inferred from the text. The description of “fused cribriform glands” is suggestive but not quantified into a Gleason score.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but it contains several grammatical and spelling errors (“cantamination,” “determin,” “urothelial metaplasia in the gland ducts” should probably be “urothelial metaplasia of the gland ducts”). These issues are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they could be improved for clarity.
