#1: Yes
#2: The statement clearly indicates that the sample consists of “lastuja prostatahöyläyksestä” (chips from a prostate resection), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate). The weight and cassette handling are also mentioned, confirming the sample type.

#3: Yes
#4: The text explicitly mentions “Gleason 3 että 4 erilaistumista,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma. Although the word “adenocarcinoma” is not used, the mention of Gleason patterns 3 and 4 is sufficient to establish malignancy.

#5: Partially
#6: The statement tells us that both Gleason pattern 3 and pattern 4 are present and that pattern 4 is “a little more common,” but it does not give explicit major + minor = sum values (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7). Therefore, a precise Gleason score cannot be extracted, only inferred qualitatively.

#7: Appropriate
#8: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor domain-specific phrasing (“lastuja prostatahöyläyksestä,” “kiinnityksen jälkeen,” “rauhaskäytävissä”). These are acceptable in a pathology report and do not hinder comprehension.
