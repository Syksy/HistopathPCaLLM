#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “spån från prostatahyvling” (chips from prostate resection), which clearly identifies the sample as TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “det finns litet suspicion” and describes “fusionerande kribriforma körtlar” and “skillt stående körtlar” with both Gleason 3 and 4 differentiation, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason patterns 3 and 4 are mentioned, but no explicit major+minor=sum triplet is given. One can infer a likely Gleason score (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+3=7), yet the exact breakdown is not stated.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable despite a few spelling/grammatical errors (“efter” misspelled as “efer”, “gångsätts” likely meant “inkapslas”, “skillt” should be “skilt”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
