#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “10 biopsies and small tissue fragments,” which clearly identifies the sample type as needle-core biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “Five biopsies show cancer,” confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The Gleason scores are given for individual foci (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3) and summed (7 and 8), but the classic major+minor pattern (e.g., 3+4=7 or 4+4=8) is not explicitly written. The reader can infer the pattern, so the information is only partially complete.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a typo (“tuomr” instead of “tumor”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“final sum is 8”). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
