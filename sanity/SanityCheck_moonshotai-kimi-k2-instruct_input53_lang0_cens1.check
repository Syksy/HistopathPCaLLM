#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “Number of samples and small tissue fragments were collected” implies that some form of biopsy or resection material was received, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement says “Samples are contaminated and unable to deferentiate the findings.” This explicitly indicates that no reliable distinction between benign and malignant could be made. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy itself could not be determined, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The intended meaning is understandable, but there are grammatical issues: “Number of samples” should be “A number of samples”; “into adipose tissue” should probably be “into adipose tissue”; and “deferentiate” is a misspelling of “differentiate.” These are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible.
