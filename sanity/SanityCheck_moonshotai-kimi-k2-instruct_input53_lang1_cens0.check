#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “10 biopsiaa” (10 biopsies) and “pieniä kudosfragmentteja” (small tissue fragments), so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “viidestä löydetään syöpä” (cancer is found in five biopsies) and describes perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension, confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason information is provided for two separate foci:  
- One focus in sample 5 is described as “Gleason 4 erikoistumisella, jäännösosa Gleason 3 (pistesumma 7)” → Gleason 4+3=7.  
- The other foci in samples 3 and 4 are described as “vain Gleason luokkaa 4, lopullinen summa 8” → Gleason 4+4=8.  
However, the statement does not give a single, unified Gleason score for the entire case; instead, it reports two different scores for different foci. Therefore, a single major+minor=sum triplet for the whole case cannot be definitively inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, although the phrase “Gleason 4 erikoistumisella” is slightly non-standard (more typical would be “Gleason 4 erikoistumista”). Overall, the language is appropriate for a pathology report.
