#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “useita näytteitä ja pieniä kudosfragmentteja” (several samples and small tissue fragments), which implies a biopsy-type specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or fragments from a radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement concludes that the samples are “kontaminoituneet eikä löydöksiä voida eritellä” (contaminated and findings cannot be specified). No information is given about the presence or absence of malignancy; the examination is reported as inconclusive.  

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy status itself cannot be determined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology without grammatical errors.
