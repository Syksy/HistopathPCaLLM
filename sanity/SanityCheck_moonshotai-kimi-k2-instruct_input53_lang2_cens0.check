#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “10 biopsier och små vävnadsfragment”, clearly identifying the material as needle biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement unequivocally reports “cancer” in five of the biopsies, along with adverse features such as perineural invasion and extraprostatic extension (“växt av carcinomvävnad i fettvävnad”).

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason scores are provided for individual foci (Gleason 4 and Gleason 3 in one biopsy, sum 7; Gleason 4 only in others, sum 8), but the overall case-level Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is not explicitly stated. One can infer that the highest-grade focus is Gleason 4+4=8, yet the exact major/minor breakdown for the entire specimen is missing.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but contains a typo (“untanför” instead of “utanför”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“resterande delen är Gleason 3 (poängsum 7)” and “resultat är sum 8”). These do not impede comprehension but could be polished for clarity.
