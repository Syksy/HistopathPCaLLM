#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radical prostatectomy under investigation,” which clearly identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “under microscope found tumor tissue” and later specifies “Adenocarcinoma covers ca 25 % of samples surface,” confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives the dominant differentiation class as 4 and a smaller portion as class 3, implying a Gleason pattern 4+3=7. However, it does not explicitly state the major and minor patterns in the standard “major+minor=sum” format, so the score must be inferred rather than directly read.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and largely appropriate for a lay reader, although a few phrases (“converging gland ducts,” “basis slide”) are slightly non-standard. These do not impede overall comprehension.
