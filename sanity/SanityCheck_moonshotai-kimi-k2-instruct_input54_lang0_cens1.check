#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and describes how they are organised into macro slides taken from apex, basis and seminal vesicles, which strongly implies a radical-prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated (e.g. “radical prostatectomy” or “biopsy”), so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: No  
#4: The text reports “suspicious changes of tissue” and “abnormalities”, but explicitly states that “determination of the changes is not possible” because of artifacts. Therefore malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings remain inconclusive.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern or score is provided, and the inability to determine the nature of the changes precludes any inference of Gleason grade.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but contains non-standard phrasing such as “macro slides”, “basis slide”, and “changes of tissue protrudes”. Minor grammatical corrections (e.g. “changes … protrude”, “basis slides”) would improve clarity for a lay reader.
