#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikaaliprostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) and describes the slicing scheme (parts A–C from apex, D–J from base, N–O seminal vesicles), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “mikroskoopilla nähdään kasvainkudosta” (tumour tissue is seen) and later confirms “Adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma), so malignancy is unequivocally present.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives “Dominoiva erikoistumisluokka 4, pienempi osa luokkaa 3”, which translates to a dominant pattern 4 and a minor pattern 3. This corresponds to Gleason 4+3=7.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology. No corrections are needed for clarity.
