#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) that have been arranged into macroscopic slices from apex to base and includes seminal vesicles. This corresponds to a radical prostatectomy specimen.

#3: Partially  
#4: Suspicious, infiltrative changes are described bilaterally and extracapsular extension is noted on the left. However, the pathologist explicitly states that artefacts make definitive assessment impossible, so malignancy is strongly suggested but not conclusively confirmed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the text states that determining the changes is impossible due to artefacts, so no valid inference of Gleason score can be made.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is professional and understandable to a lay reader; only minor domain-specific terms (“makroleikkeet”, “artifaktojen”) are used, which are acceptable in a pathology report.
