#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “shaving material” and that 4 g of it were embedded in 8 cassettes. This strongly suggests a trans-urethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimen, but the exact sample type is not explicitly named, so the assessment is only partial.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text clearly states “most is malignant differentiated prostate cancer,” so malignancy is unambiguously confirmed.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives “Gleason 5” as the dominant pattern and “small component of Gleason 4.” Interpreting these as the major and minor patterns yields a sum of 9, i.e., Gleason 5+4=9.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The meaning is understandable, but the phrasing is non-standard (“malignant differentiated prostate cancer,” “under microscope can be observed”). More idiomatic wording would be “poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma” and “on microscopy.”
