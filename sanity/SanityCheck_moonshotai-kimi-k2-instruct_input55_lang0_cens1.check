#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samples on 8 cassettes” and gives a weight (≈4 g), which implies a TURP-type resection, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The text only says “some suspicious changes” and “unable to determine at this point”. Suspicious is not a confirmed malignancy, and the conclusion explicitly states that malignancy cannot be determined. Hence malignancy status is not assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The meaning is understandable, but the phrasing is awkward (“Entire samples material is 5,7”, “approx 4 grams are taken as samples on 8 cassettes”). Corrected version: “The total specimen weight is 5.7 g; approximately 4 g were sampled into 8 cassettes.”
