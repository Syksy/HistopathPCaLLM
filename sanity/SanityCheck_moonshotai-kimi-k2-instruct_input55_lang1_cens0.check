#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “höyläysmateriaali” (TURP chips) and gives the weight, so the sample type is clearly identified as transurethral resection material.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “suurin osa on pahanlaatuista erikoistunutta eturauhassyöpää” (the majority is malignant specialized prostate cancer), confirming malignancy.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly: “Gleason 5” as the major component and “pieni komponentti Gleason 4:sta” as the minor component, allowing the score to be inferred as 5+4=9.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable; the only minor non-standard feature is the use of “Gleason 5” and “Gleason 4:sta” instead of “Gleason pattern 5” and “Gleason pattern 4,” which is acceptable in Finnish clinical shorthand.
