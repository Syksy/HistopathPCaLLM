#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions that “the entire sample material is 5.7” (grams) and that 4 g are taken into 8 cassettes, which implies a TURP (transurethral resection) specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The report describes “some suspicious changes” and atrophic glands with mild inflammation, but explicitly states that malignancy cannot be determined at this stage and further studies are required. Therefore, the presence or absence of malignancy is not assessable from the text.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided, and the text explicitly indicates that further investigations are needed, so no Gleason score can be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable. While the phrase “Koko näytemateriaali on 5.7” could be more precise (e.g., “Koko näytemateriaalin paino on 5,7 g”), the intended meaning is clear and the language is suitable for a lay reader.
