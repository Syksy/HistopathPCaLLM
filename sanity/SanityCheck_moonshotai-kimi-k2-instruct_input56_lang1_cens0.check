#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly identifies the samples as “systeemibiopsiat” (systematic biopsies) taken from both the right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly stated.

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are explicitly reported: “karsinoidi” (carcinoid, i.e., carcinoma) is found in biopsies 1–3 on the left side, while biopsies 4–6 are benign. Thus, malignancy status is unambiguous.

#5: Yes  
#6: The summary gives the Gleason score directly as “3+3=6” for the left-sided cancer, satisfying the required format.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in standard Finnish medical terminology. While “karsinoidi” is slightly non-standard (the usual term is “karsinooma”), it is understandable in context. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
