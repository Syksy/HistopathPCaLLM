#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “eturauhaskudos” (prostate tissue) and describes microscopic findings, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without further specification.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says the tissue is “suurimmaksi osaksi benign hyperplastista” (largely benign hyperplastic) and does not report any malignant diagnosis. The focal changes are described as architectural rather than clearly neoplastic, and the final sentence “Ei voida määrittää näytelaadun takia” (cannot be determined due to sample quality) further underlines that malignancy cannot be confirmed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant finding is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable to a lay reader, but the phrase “Muutoksia kudoksessa löydetty oikeassa apexissa” is slightly awkward; a clearer wording would be “Muutoksia löydettiin kudoksesta oikeassa apexissa”. Overall, however, the meaning is clear.
