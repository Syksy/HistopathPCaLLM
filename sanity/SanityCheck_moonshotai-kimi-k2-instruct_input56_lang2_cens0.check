#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “systembiopsier” (systematic biopsies) and gives the lengths of six cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “karcinom” (carcinoma) is found in biopsies 1–3 from the left side, confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The summary provides the Gleason score directly: “Poängsum 3+3=6”, which is the required major + minor = sum format.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains a few spelling/typing errors (“karcinon” should be “karcinom”, “kancern” should be “cancer”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
