#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “provpreparat” (specimen preparation) and describes prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can only infer that it is some form of prostate tissue specimen.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Kan inte bestämmas på grund av provkvalitet” (cannot be determined due to specimen quality). Therefore, malignancy status is not assessable.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy cannot be determined, no Gleason score is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “ses mycket i stroma” could be “ses i stromat i stor utsträckning”) do not impede comprehension.
