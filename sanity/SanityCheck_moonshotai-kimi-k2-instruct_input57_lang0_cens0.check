#1: Yes
#2: The term “prostatectomy preparate” clearly indicates that the specimen is a radical prostatectomy.

#3: Yes
#4: The statement explicitly mentions “tumor tissue found in the right apex,” confirming the presence of malignancy.

#5: Yes
#6: The text gives the dominant pattern as Gleason 3 (>70 %), the secondary pattern as Gleason 4 (5–10 %), and a tertiary Gleason 5 (<1 %). This translates to a Gleason score of 3+4=7 (tertiary 5 noted but not added to the sum), so the major+minor=sum format can be inferred.

#7: Appropriate
#8: The wording is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (“preparate,” “class” instead of “pattern,” “ca” for “circa”). These are acceptable in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
