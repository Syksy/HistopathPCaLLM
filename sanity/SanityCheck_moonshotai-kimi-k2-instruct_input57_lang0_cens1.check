#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samples” and “histological examination,” but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). We can infer that some tissue was examined, yet the exact nature of the sample remains unclear.

#3: No  
#4: The report describes “mostly benign hyperplastic prostate tissue” and “chronic inflammation,” but it also refers to a 3 × 5 mm focus with “merging glands.” The final sentence says “Unable to determine due to sample quality,” which explicitly indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out. Therefore, malignancy status is not assessable.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the inability to determine malignancy precludes any inference of Gleason grading.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing such as “Samples preparate run” (likely intended as “Samples prepared according to normal protocol”) and “observed greatly in stroma” (probably “observed extensively in the stroma”). These minor grammatical issues do not render the statement incomprehensible, but they could be polished for clarity.
