#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomiapreparaatti”, which translates to radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “Kasvainkudosta löydetään” (tumor tissue is found) in the right apex, confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The description gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 3, 4 and 5, but it does not provide explicit major and minor pattern scores or a summed Gleason score. One can infer that the dominant pattern is 3 (>70 %) and the secondary pattern is 4 (5–10 %), yielding an inferred score of 3+4=7, yet this is not explicitly stated.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is professional and understandable; only minor stylistic choices such as “suurin piirtein noin” (roughly about) are slightly redundant but do not impede comprehension.
