#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “näytepreparaatti” (sample preparation) and “eturauhaskudosta” (prostate tissue), which implies the specimen is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The findings are described as “benign hyperplastista eturauhaskudosta” (benign hyperplastic prostate tissue) and “kroonista inflammaatiota” (chronic inflammation). There is no mention of malignancy, and the statement does not confirm or deny the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not relevant or inferable from the statement.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is grammatically correct and understandable, though it uses some domain-specific terminology (e.g., “stroomassa,” “rauhasrakenteet”). It is appropriate for a layman with basic medical context.
