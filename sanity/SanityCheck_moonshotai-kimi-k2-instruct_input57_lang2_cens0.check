#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomipreparat” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported: a tumour focus is located in the right apex, and Gleason grades 3 and 4 are assigned to the cancerous tissue.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The text gives the major pattern (Gleason 3, >70 %) and the minor pattern (Gleason 4, 5–10 %), but no explicit sum is provided. The tertiary pattern 5 is <1 % and does not affect the sum. One can reasonably infer a score of 3+4=7, yet the statement does not state the sum outright.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor non-standard phrasing (“en helt del”, “praktiskt oansenlig”) that does not impede comprehension.
