#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate shavings” and gives the weight (20 g), which clearly identifies the specimen as transurethral resection (TURP) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “histologically found … prostate cancer,” so malignancy is confirmed.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The description gives the relative proportions of Gleason patterns 3 (>50 %) and 4 (~20 %), from which a Gleason score of 3+4=7 can be inferred. However, the exact major/minor pattern assignment is not spelled out in the standard “3+4=7” format, so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “ca 20 %”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
