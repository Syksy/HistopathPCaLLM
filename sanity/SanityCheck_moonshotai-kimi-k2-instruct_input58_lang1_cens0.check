#1: Yes  
#2: The text clearly states “prostatalastuja” (prostate chips), which in routine Finnish histopathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Thus the sample type is identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly mentions “eturauhassyöpää” (prostate cancer) and “kasvainkudosta noin 40 % materiaalista” (tumour tissue about 40 % of the material), confirming a malignant finding.

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 3 (>50 %) and the next most common as Gleason 4 (~20 %). This allows an approximate Gleason score of 3+4=7 to be inferred, but the exact percentages for major and minor patterns are not precisely stated, so the score cannot be taken as formally validated.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, professional Finnish with only minor colloquial phrasing (“nähdään leikkeissä”). It is readily understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons; no significant grammatical errors are present.
