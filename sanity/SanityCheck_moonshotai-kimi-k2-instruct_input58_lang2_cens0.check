#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates the sample type is TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “histologiskt ses … prostatacancer” and describes tumor tissue occupying about 40 % of the material, confirming a malignant finding.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The dominant pattern is given as Gleason 3 (>50 %) and the secondary pattern as Gleason 4 (~20 %). From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7. However, the exact percentages for the minor pattern are approximate (“cirka 20 %”) and the wording “näst vanligaste komponent klass 4” is slightly informal, so the score is inferable but not stated in the canonical “major+minor=sum” format.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is clear and understandable; only minor colloquial phrasing (“klass 4 andel”) is used, which is acceptable in routine pathology reports.
