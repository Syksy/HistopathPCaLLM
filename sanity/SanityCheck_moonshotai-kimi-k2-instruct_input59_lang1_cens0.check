#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “edustavia biopsioita” (representative biopsies) from the right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that in the left lobe “nähdään pieni fokus, jossa syöpää” (a small focus is seen with cancer) and later confirms “karsinooman kokonaispituus on 10 mm”, so malignancy is unequivocally present.

#5: Partially  
#6: A Gleason score is given as “Gleason 3 erikoistumisasteella”, which is interpreted as Gleason grade 3. However, only the major pattern (3) is provided; no minor pattern or sum is stated, so the full Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be reconstructed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “Gleason 3 erikoistumisasteella” instead of “Gleason grade 3”) are acceptable in clinical reports.
