#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “näytteet 1 ja 2 oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta” (samples 1 and 2 from right and left lobes), which implies a bilateral biopsy set. However, it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the sample type can only be partially inferred.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes a “pieni fokus muutoksia” (small focus of changes) with cribriform growth and chronic inflammation, but explicitly says differentiation cannot be assessed (“ei pystytä erottamaan erilaistumista”). While cribriform architecture is suspicious for malignancy, the pathologist stops short of confirming carcinoma. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided, nor can they be reliably inferred from the text. The mention of cribriform growth is insufficient to assign a specific Gleason pattern.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable to a layman, using standard clinical phrasing. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “muutoksen kokonaispituus on 10 mm” instead of “muutoksen pituus on 10 mm”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
