#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “repsentativa biopsier” (representative biopsies) from right and left lobes, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: It states that “från vänster lob ses ett litet fokus med cancer” and later “Carcinom finns totalt på 10 mm längd”, confirming the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The text gives only the major pattern (“enbart Gleason 3 differentiering”), implying a Gleason score of 3 + X = 3 + ?. Because the minor pattern is not specified, the complete major+minor=sum format cannot be fully reconstructed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains a typo (“repsentativa” should be “representativa”) and slightly awkward phrasing (“kommer ingen tumörvävnad fram”). These are minor issues and do not impede comprehension.
