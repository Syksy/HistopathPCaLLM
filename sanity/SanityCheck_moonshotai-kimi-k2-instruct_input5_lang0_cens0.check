#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly states “radical prostatectomy” and gives further macroscopic details (weight, colour coding of sections, block designations), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text reports “cancerous tissue is observed in both macroes of the apex (A+B)” and describes architectural patterns consistent with prostate adenocarcinoma. Other blocks are stated to be “clean,” confirming that malignancy is present in the specified areas.

#5: Yes  
#6: Two separate tumour areas are described:  
- Macro A: “growth pattern 4+3” → Gleason 4+3=7.  
- Macro B: “higher sum (9) is observed of architecture 4+5” → Gleason 4+5=9.  
Both major and minor patterns and the summed scores are explicitly provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and uses standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (“macroes” instead of “macroscopic sections,” “seminal vehicles” instead of “seminal vesicles”) are common in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
