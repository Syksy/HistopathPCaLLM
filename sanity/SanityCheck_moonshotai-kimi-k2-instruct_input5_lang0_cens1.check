#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “samples taken from both apex and basis” and “samplings from the left … right”, which strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement repeatedly says that “clear prostate tissue” is seen and that Gleason classes “could not be inferred.” No malignant diagnosis is given; instead, the findings are inconclusive. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: The text explicitly states that “Major and minor Gleason classes … could not be inferred” and that a “suspected higher sum” is referred to a colleague. No actual Gleason pattern or score is provided, so the Gleason information is not assessable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The language is generally understandable, but contains awkward or non-standard phrasing such as “relatively enlargened prostate” (should be “enlarged”), “inspected longitudinally + crossed” (unclear), and “main macros” (ambiguous). These minor issues do not render the text incomprehensible, but a lay reader might need clarification.
