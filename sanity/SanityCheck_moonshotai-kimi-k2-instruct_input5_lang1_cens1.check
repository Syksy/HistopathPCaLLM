#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “laajentuneesta prostatasta” (an enlarged prostate) and describes processing of left- and right-side sections, apex and base samples, and indexing from A to H. These details strongly suggest a radical prostatectomy specimen, but the exact sample type is never stated explicitly, hence only a partial assessment.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that a larger and smaller Gleason grade “ei pysty luotettavasti määrittelemään” (cannot be reliably determined). It also mentions that a “suurempi summa” (higher sum) is only suspected and will be referred to a colleague for further studies. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed from this report.

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy itself cannot be assessed, no reliable Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) are provided or can be inferred. The text only indicates that scores cannot be reliably assigned.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and vocabulary are understandable to a lay reader, despite some domain-specific phrasing (e.g., “soluarkkitehtuureja”, “perineuraalista invaasiotakaan”). No major errors impede comprehension.
