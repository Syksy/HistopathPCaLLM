#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Radikal prostatektomiprov” (radical prostatectomy specimen), so the sample type is clearly identified.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “tumör vävnad” (tumour tissue) is found in both apex macro-blocks (A and B), confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Partially  
#6: Gleason scores are provided for the two tumour-containing blocks: 4+3=7 in block A and 4+5=9 in block B. However, the statement does not give an overall Gleason score for the entire specimen (e.g., the highest or global score), so the complete Gleason information in the requested format (major+minor=sum) for the whole case cannot be fully inferred.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but it contains several grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Sättas” should be “Sätts”, “vesiklen” should be “vesikeln”, “andra prostatas makroblock rena” is missing a verb). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
