#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “förstorad prostata” (enlarged prostate) and describes sections from left and right sides, apex and base, implying a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says that major and minor Gleason grades “kunde inte säkert bestämdes” (could not be determined with certainty). It also refers the case to a colleague for further examination. Therefore, malignancy cannot be assessed from this statement alone.

#5: No  
#6: Because Gleason grades (major and minor) could not be determined, no valid Gleason score (major+minor=sum) can be inferred from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “snitter från både apex och basis igångsattes”, “det är trolig att prostatas kapsel är hel”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
