#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatectomy operated preparate”, which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Findings represent prostate carcinoma” and describes carcinoma in both lobes, confirming a malignant diagnosis.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The report gives the dominant pattern (“mostly Gleason class 4”) and a secondary component (“10 % of tissue Gleason class 5”), but it does not explicitly state the major + minor = sum format (e.g., 4+5=9). One can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9, yet this is not directly provided.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“preparate”, “anteriorically”, “marginals”) and minor grammatical slips. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but a polished version would improve clarity.
