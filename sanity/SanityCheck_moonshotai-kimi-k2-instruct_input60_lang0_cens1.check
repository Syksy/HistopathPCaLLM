#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “macro cassettes A-H” and “ordinary cassettes I-L”, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen (apex, base, research blocks). However, the exact sample type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The sentence “Unable to determine the findings” explicitly states that malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded. Therefore malignancy status is not assessable.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains non-standard wording (“preparate sized”, “anteriorically changes”, “marginals”). Standard terms would be “preparation”, “anterior changes”, and “margins”.
