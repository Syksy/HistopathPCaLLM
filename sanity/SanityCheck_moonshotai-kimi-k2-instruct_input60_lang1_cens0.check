#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatektomiaoperoitu preparaatti” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and gives its dimensions and weight, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that carcinoma is seen in both lobes anteriorly and that the findings represent prostate carcinoma (eturauhaskarsinooma), so malignancy is confirmed.

#5: Partially  
#6: The statement provides the dominant Gleason grade (4) and mentions that about 10 % of the tissue is Gleason grade 5. From this we can reasonably infer a Gleason score of 4+5=9 (or 5+4=9), but the exact major/minor breakdown is not explicitly given, only the predominance of grade 4.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and uses standard medical terminology. A layman might need some terms explained (e.g., “eturauhaskarsinooma”), but the grammar and structure are appropriate for a pathology report.
