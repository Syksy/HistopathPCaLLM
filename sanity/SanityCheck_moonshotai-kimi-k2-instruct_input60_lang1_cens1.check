#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “tutkimusnäytteet A-B, apex C-E, basis F-H” and lists macro-cassettes A–H plus four ordinary cassettes I–L. This clearly indicates that the material is a radical prostatectomy specimen (standard sampling of apex, base, and mid-gland with bilateral lobes).  

#3: No  
#4: The text states “Ei voida määrittää löydöksiä” (“Findings cannot be determined”). No mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignancy is present; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: Since malignancy is not established, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard histopathology terminology. No corrections are needed.
