#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostatektomiopererad preparatet” (radical prostatectomy specimen) and gives its dimensions and weight, so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “karcinom” (carcinoma) is observed in both lobes anteriorly and that these changes represent “prostatakarcinom” (prostate carcinoma). Thus, malignancy is confirmed.  

#5: Partially  
#6: The statement indicates that the carcinoma is “till största delen bestående av Gleason typ 4, men ca 10% av vävnaden är av Gleason typ 5.” From this we can infer a dominant pattern 4 and a minor pattern 5, giving a Gleason score of 4+5=9. However, the exact wording does not explicitly state “Gleason score 4+5=9,” so the assessment is only partial.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “repsenterar” instead of “representerar”). A lay reader could grasp the essential information with little difficulty.
