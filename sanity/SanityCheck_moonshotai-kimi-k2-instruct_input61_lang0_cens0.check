#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “Formalin fixated shavings” strongly suggests TUR-P (transurethral resection) material, but the statement never explicitly names the specimen type (biopsy, TUR-P, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Thus the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously assessed.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “tumor tissue in almost half of the shavings” and describes the tumour as “quite poorly differentiated,” confirming the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The statement gives “Mostly seen Gleason class 4, smaller portion Gleason 5. Therefore sum is 9.” Interpreting “mostly” as the primary pattern (4) and “smaller portion” as the secondary pattern (5) yields a standard Gleason score 4+5=9.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“Formalin fixated shavings”, “Histologically can be seen”, “sum is 9” without explicitly stating “Gleason score”). These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
