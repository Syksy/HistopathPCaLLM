#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “Formalin fixated samples” and “six cassettes,” which implies a tissue specimen, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement says “quite poorly differentiated” changes and “small cribriform glands,” both of which are highly suggestive of malignancy. However, it also states that “unable to determin tha type of tissue changes,” so the report itself does not formally confirm malignancy. Thus malignancy can only be inferred, not fully assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor) or sum is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the vague wording “quite poorly differentiated.”  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable to a layman, but contains several minor grammatical errors: “fixated” should be “fixed,” “approx 15” should specify “15 g,” “Changes is” should be “Changes are,” “determin” should be “determine,” and “tha” should be “the.”
