#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “formaliinifiksatoituja lastuja” (formalin-fixed chips) and gives a total weight of about 15 g. This clearly indicates the sample type is TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “nähdään tuumorikudosta” (tumor tissue is seen) and describes it as poorly differentiated, occupying roughly 35 % of the surface. This confirms the presence of malignancy.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report provides the Gleason pattern distribution: “Lähinnä nähdään Gleason 4 luokkaa, pienempi osa Gleason 5. Pistesummaksi muodostuu siis 9.” From this we can directly infer the score as 4 + 5 = 9.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable, using standard histopathological terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “kasvan” instead of “kasvain”) are acceptable within the domain and do not impede comprehension.
