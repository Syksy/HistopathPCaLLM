#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “formaliinifiksatoituja näytteitä” (formalin-fixed samples) and gives a total weight, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text describes “muutoksia” (changes) that are “huonosti erilaistuneet” (poorly differentiated) and mentions cribriform glands, both of which are highly suggestive of malignancy. However, the wording stops short of an outright diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma, and the final sentence casts doubt on the ability to determine the type of tissue change. Thus malignancy is strongly implied but not unequivocally confirmed.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the text. The only grade-related descriptor is “huonosti erilaistuneet,” which is too vague to assign specific Gleason scores.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the phrasing “muutoksia melkein puolessa näytteestä” and “Näytelaatu on kehno” could be clearer. Replacing “näytteestä” with “näytteistä” and rephrasing “Näytelaatu on kehno” as “Näytteiden laatu on heikko” would improve grammatical accuracy without sacrificing domain-specific style.
