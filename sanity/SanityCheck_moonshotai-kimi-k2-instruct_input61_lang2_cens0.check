#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the material as “formalinfixerade spånar” (formalin-fixed chips), which corresponds to TURP (transurethral resection) chips. Weight and cassette handling are also mentioned, so the sample type is unambiguous.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that “tumorvävnad” is present in roughly half of the chips and occupies about 35 % of the tissue surface, confirming malignant findings.

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives the Gleason pattern distribution: “närmast Gleason 4 differentiering, mindre andel av Gleason 5” and concludes with “poängsumman blir således 9.” This translates directly to Gleason 4+5=9.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is understandable and uses standard histopathological phrasing. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “so att” should be “så att”, “Påängsumman” should be “Poängsumman”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
