#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “formalinfixerade prov” (formalin-fixed specimens) and gives a total weight, but it never explicitly states the source of the tissue (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not confidently assessed.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text clearly reports “dåligt differentierad” (poorly differentiated) carcinoma and “cribriform körtlar” (cribriform glands), both unequivocally malignant findings.  

#5: No  
#6: Although malignancy is confirmed, no Gleason pattern numbers (major, minor) or sum are provided, nor can they be reliably inferred from the wording.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “so” should be “så”, “över hälften av proven undersökts” is missing an auxiliary verb). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
