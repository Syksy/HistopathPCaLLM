#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “samples 1-6” and “right and left lobes,” which strongly implies a prostate biopsy set, but the word “biopsy” itself is never used, so the sample type is only partially ascertainable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly says “no carcinoma,” which clearly conveys that no malignant findings were identified.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore, it cannot be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable to a layman, but contains two spelling errors (“chnages” should be “changes,” and “determin” should be “determine”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension.
