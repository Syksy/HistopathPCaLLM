#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Näytteet 1-6 oikeasta ja vasemmasta lohkosta,” which clearly indicates that the material consists of six biopsy cores taken from the right and left prostate lobes.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that “ei karsinoomaa” (no carcinoma) is seen in the other samples, but it also mentions “pieni fokus muutoksia” and “toinen muutosfokus” whose nature is not specified beyond size. Because the type of these foci is not determined (“ei voida määrittää muutosten tyyppiä”), the overall malignancy status remains inconclusive rather than definitively benign.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can it be inferred from the text.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “muutoksia löydetään,” “kroonista inflammaatiota,” and “ei karsinoomaa.” No significant grammatical errors or ambiguities are present.
