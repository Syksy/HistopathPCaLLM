#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATECTOMY REPORT,” which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that three tumour foci were found, lists a Gleason score of 8, and describes tumour proportion and margin status. These details confirm the presence of malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives “Primary Gleason class: 4” and “Secondary Gleason class: 4,” from which the standard notation 4+4=8 can be directly inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is understandable and uses terminology familiar to clinicians. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Seminel vesicle” instead of “seminal vesicle,” “preparate” instead of “specimen”) does not impede comprehension.
