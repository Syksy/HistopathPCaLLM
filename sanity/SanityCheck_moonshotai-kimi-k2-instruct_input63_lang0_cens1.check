#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “macroslides were taken from the preparate” and describes tissue dimensions, which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “preparate” is non-standard and the actual term “radical prostatectomy” is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly confirmed.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that “three suspicious area were found” and gives measurements, but it never explicitly confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. Suspicious areas alone do not equate to a verified malignant diagnosis, so malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Although fields for “Primary Gleason class”, “Secondary Gleason class”, and “Gleason score” are listed, they are all left blank. No numerical values or valid inferences are provided, so the Gleason score cannot be determined.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several grammatical issues: “preparate” should be “preparation” or “specimen”; “Most of finding” should be “Most of the findings”; “some finding was found” is awkward; “so to seminal vesicles” should be “as do the seminal vesicles”. These errors are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
