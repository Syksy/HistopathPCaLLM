#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly states “PROSTATEKTOMIARAPORTTI” (radical prostatectomy report) and describes macroscopic and microscopic examination of the entire gland, which unambiguously identifies the sample type as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text clearly mentions the presence of tumour tissue (“kasvaimen osuus: 10 %”), three tumour foci, and provides Gleason grades, confirming malignant (adenocarcinoma) findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report lists “Yleisin Gleason luokka: 4” (primary pattern 4), “Sekundäärinen Gleason luokka: 4” (secondary pattern 4), and “Gleason summa: 8”, which directly translates to Gleason 4+4=8.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is standard medical terminology used in pathology reports. While it contains domain-specific abbreviations and phrasing (e.g., “semimaalivesikkeli-invaasio”), these are appropriate for the intended professional audience and remain comprehensible to informed lay readers.
