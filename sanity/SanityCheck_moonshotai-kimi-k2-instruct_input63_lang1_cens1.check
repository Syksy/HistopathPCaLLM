#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “preparaatti” and gives a tissue size (4 × 2 × 1.5 mm), which implies a biopsy rather than TURP or radical prostatectomy, but the exact sample type is never explicitly stated.

#3: No  
#4: While three “epäilyttäviä alueita” (suspicious areas) are noted, no definitive diagnosis of malignancy (or benignity) is provided. The findings are inconclusive.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: No Gleason grades or scores are given; the fields for primary, secondary and total Gleason are left blank.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and the terminology is standard for a pathology report, although lay readers might need clarification on some terms.
