#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “6 makrosnitt” (six macroscopic slices) and gives weight (80 g), which strongly implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “radical prostatectomy” itself is never stated, so the sample type can only be inferred, not explicitly confirmed.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The text states that “tre suspekt område” (three suspicious areas) were found, but it never explicitly confirms the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma. The absence of a definitive malignant diagnosis leaves the malignancy status ambiguous.  

#5: No  
#6: Neither primary nor secondary Gleason grades are provided, and no Gleason score is given. Therefore, the Gleason information cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains grammatical omissions (e.g., missing articles, inconsistent punctuation) and some awkward phrasing (“Mest av fynd var…”). These are minor and do not impede comprehension, but polishing would improve clarity.
