#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “vävnadsspånor” (tissue chips/shavings) taken “nära urotelcellerna” (close to urothelial cells), which strongly implies transurethral resection (TUR-P) material, but the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The pathologists confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma with updated Gleason grades, so malignancy is clearly established.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The updated Gleason pattern is explicitly given as “differentieringsgrad 4 (dominerande) och grad 3, med även tertiär grad 5.” In standard notation this translates to 4 + 3 = 7 with tertiary 5, i.e., Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3).  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains some non-standard phrasing (e.g., “atrofisk och kanske atypiskt pattern” mixes Swedish and English; “brännartefakter” is colloquial for cautery artefacts). These are minor domain-specific quirks and do not impede comprehension.
