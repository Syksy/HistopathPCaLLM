#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) as the original specimen type, and it also refers to additional samples (lymph-node packets and seminal vesicles) that were examined. Therefore the sample type is clearly stated.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text confirms the presence of “multifokal adenokarcinom” (multifocal adenocarcinoma) in the prostate, i.e. malignant findings. It also explicitly states that the newly examined lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are benign (“rena”, “endast normalt cellmaterial”). Thus the malignancy status is fully assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: Gleason scores are provided for the primary tumour: Gleason 4+4, 3+3, 3+4 and 4+3. These are valid Gleason patterns that allow the major, minor and sum scores to be inferred (e.g. 4+4=8, 3+3=6, 3+4=7, 4+3=7).

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as “fynden är benigna” and “kancern” (colloquial spelling of “cancern”) are acceptable in clinical notes and do not impede comprehension.
