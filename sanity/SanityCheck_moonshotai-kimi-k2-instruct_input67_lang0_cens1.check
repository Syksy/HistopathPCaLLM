#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate gland tissue” and describes the macroscopic appearance (“grey-white”, “firm consistency”), which together clearly indicate that the material examined is prostate tissue. Although the exact procedure (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not named, the context is sufficient to determine the sample type.

#3: Partially  
#4: The text states there are “suspicious changes with a mixed architecture” and that the Gleason grade “is not determined.” These phrases imply that malignancy cannot be ruled out, yet no definitive diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma is given. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: The Gleason system is explicitly mentioned, but the report concludes that “finding's class is not determined.” No major or minor Gleason patterns, nor any sum score, are provided or can be inferred from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but contains several minor grammatical and spelling issues: “form” should be “from,” “srface” should be “surface,” “regionaol” should be “regional,” and “finding's class” should probably be “findings’ classification.” These do not impede comprehension but are noticeable.
