#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions that the submitted samples consist of “prostatarauhaskudosta” (prostate gland tissue) weighing 12 g in total, which clearly identifies the specimen type as prostate tissue. Although the exact source (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not specified, the tissue type itself is unambiguous.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes “histologisia merkkejä epäilyttävistä muutoksista” (histological signs of suspicious changes) and “merkittäviä muutoksia on 50 % koko pinnasta” (significant changes in 50 % of the surface), but it explicitly states “Gleason systeemin mukaan ei määritelty löydöksiä” (no findings defined according to the Gleason system). This indicates that malignancy is strongly suspected but not formally confirmed or graded. Therefore, malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Because the report explicitly states that no Gleason grading was performed (“Gleason systeemin mukaan ei määritelty löydöksiä”), no major, minor, or sum scores are provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and uses standard medical terminology understandable to a lay reader with minimal domain knowledge.
