#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samtlida insända vävnadsbitar” (multiple tissue pieces submitted together) and describes them as “prostatakörtelvävnad” (prostate gland tissue). However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type remains ambiguous.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The report speaks of “histologiska tecken av suspekt förändringar” (histological signs of suspicious changes) and “höggradiga förändringar” (high-grade changes), implying malignancy. Yet it simultaneously says the findings “inte graderas enligt Gleason-systemet” (are not graded according to the Gleason system) and uses the phrase “fynden är förenliga med medelhög risk” (findings compatible with intermediate risk). This leaves the definitive malignant status somewhat unclear.  

#5: No  
#6: The text explicitly states that the findings are not graded with the Gleason system, so no major, minor, or summed Gleason scores are provided or can be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is professional and understandable; minor stylistic choices (e.g., “samtlida” instead of “samlade”) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
