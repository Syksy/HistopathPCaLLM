#1: Partially  
#2: The phrase “prostate samples” is mentioned, but no specific sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is given, so the exact nature of the specimen remains unclear.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement only says “mix features” without specifying whether these mixed features include malignancy or are purely benign. No explicit mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or benign diagnosis is provided.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are reported or inferable from the text.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The wording is understandable but contains non-standard phrasing (“mix features” instead of “mixed features”) and an incomplete line “T=, M=”. These issues are minor and do not render the text incomprehensible.
