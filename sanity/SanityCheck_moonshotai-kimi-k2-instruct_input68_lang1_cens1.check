#1: No  
#2: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) but never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. The phrase “3 blokissa” only tells us the material was processed into three blocks, not the original sample type.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “vain sekalaisia ominaisuuksia” (only miscellaneous/varied features) and gives no indication of malignancy. There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any other malignant finding.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is not relevant. The fields “T=, M=” are left empty, offering no data from which to infer a Gleason score.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is concise and understandable; it uses standard medical phrasing such as “YHTEENVETO” and “sekalaisia ominaisuuksia.” No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
