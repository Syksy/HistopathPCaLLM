#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which is the Swedish equivalent of TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips. This clearly identifies the sample type.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement repeatedly states that only benign properties are seen (“endast benign egenskaper”, “bara benign egenskaper”). Therefore, malignancy status is explicitly given as negative.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required. Consequently, no major/minor/sum scores are available.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is concise and domain-appropriate; the capitalised summary and the use of “T=77100, M=09450” are standard Swedish pathology report conventions and perfectly understandable to professionals.
