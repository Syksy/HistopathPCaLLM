#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate samples” and the later “SUMMARY PROSTATE SAMPLES” confirms that the material examined consists of prostate tissue. No further qualifier (biopsy, TURP, RP) is given, but the sample type is clearly prostate tissue.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “There is no PIN” and does not mention carcinoma; therefore the findings are explicitly benign. Malignancy status can be assessed as negative.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is concise and understandable. Minor non-standard capitalization (“SOME MIX CHANGES T= M=”) does not impede comprehension.
