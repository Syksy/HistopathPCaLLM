#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and lists left- and right-sided cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The summary states “VAIN BENIGN PIIRTEITÄ” (only benign features) and no mention of carcinoma, so the findings are confirmed benign.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is concise and understandable despite minor non-standard Finnish spelling (“benigniä”). The meaning is clear to a lay reader.
