#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly mentions “eturauhasnäytettä” (prostate samples) and gives the number of cores from each side (6 from the left, 5 from the right), so the sample type is identifiable as prostate biopsies.  

#3: No  
#4: The report describes only inflammatory changes (“akuuttia ja kroonista inflammaatiota”, “inflammatiota”) and explicitly states “Ei PIN-muutoksia” (no PIN changes). There is no mention of carcinoma or any malignant finding, so malignancy cannot be assessed as present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no carcinoma is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and therefore cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is concise and understandable; it uses standard medical terminology (e.g., “eturauhasnäytettä”, “inflammatiota”, “PIN-muutoksia”) appropriate for a pathology report.
