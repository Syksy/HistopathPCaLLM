#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “shaving chips” and “three tissue cassettes,” which clearly identifies the material as TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “relatively normal prostate glandular structures” are seen and concludes that the findings “hint at … benign prostate hyperplasia.” This is an explicit declaration that no malignancy is present.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because the findings are reported as benign (benign prostatic hyperplasia), no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is grammatically understandable and uses terminology that a layman could grasp, despite minor stylistic choices such as “grandular” instead of “glandular.”
