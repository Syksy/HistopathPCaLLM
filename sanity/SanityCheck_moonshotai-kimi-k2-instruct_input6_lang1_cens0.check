#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “4 g höyläyslastuja” (4 g of resection chips), which clearly identifies the sample as TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) material.  

#3: No  
#4: The microscopic description reports “suhteellisen normaalia prostatasolukkoa” (relatively normal prostatic tissue) with “polttoartefakta” (thermal artefact) and “rauhaset melko tuhoutuneet” (glands largely destroyed). The only pathological suggestion is “hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan” (slight benign prostatic hyperplasia). There is no mention of malignancy; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not relevant and cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is clear, concise, and uses standard medical terminology understandable to professionals and informed laypersons.
