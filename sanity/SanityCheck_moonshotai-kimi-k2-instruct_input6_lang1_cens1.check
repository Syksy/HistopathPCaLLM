#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostata-käsittelymateriaalia” (prostate processing material) and describes fragmented pieces processed in three separate batches, but it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, but the exact specimen type remains unclear.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states that “tulokset ovat epäselvät” (the results are inconclusive) due to severe thermal artefact and fragmentation. No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; the findings are indeterminate.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and uses domain-appropriate terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prostata-käsittelymateriaalia”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
