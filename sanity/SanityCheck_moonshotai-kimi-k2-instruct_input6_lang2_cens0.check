#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “hyvlingspånor” (shavings), which is the standard term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips, so the sample type is clearly identified.  

#3: No  
#4: The microscopic description states “fynd tyder på benign hyperplasi” (findings indicate benign hyperplasia). There is no mention of malignancy; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is irrelevant and cannot be assessed.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “igångsätts” should probably be “inkläms” or “läggs in”, and “brännartefakter” is acceptable jargon but could be written as “brännskador” for clarity.
