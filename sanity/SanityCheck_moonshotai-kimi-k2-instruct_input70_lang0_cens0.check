#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “radical prostatectomy” in the summary section, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement indicates that “no residual malignancy could be found” and that only “benign features” are present. This allows a definitive assessment that the findings are benign (i.e., non-malignant).

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable, with only minor non-standard capitalization and formatting (e.g., “T= 77000, 1X010, M = 09450”) that does not impede comprehension.
