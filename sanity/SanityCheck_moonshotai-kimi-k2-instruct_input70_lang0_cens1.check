#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “prostate sample” and “prostate samples,” which implies that the material examined is prostatic tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states “Unsure of findings” and “Please discuss at MDT.” No clear statement is made about the presence or absence of malignancy; the findings are inconclusive. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major pattern, minor pattern, or sum score) is provided, nor can any be inferred from the text.

#7: Major mistakes  
#8: The grammar and wording contain significant issues: “mix inflamatoru residual could be found” is ungrammatical and unclear; “MIX FEATURES” is vague; “T= , , M =” is incomplete. These errors hinder comprehension for both laypersons and professionals.
