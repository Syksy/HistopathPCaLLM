#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaali prostatektomia” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “ei löydetty jäännös maligniteetteja” (no residual malignancies were found) and “vain benign piirteitä” (only benign features), so the absence of malignancy is explicitly confirmed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant tissue was identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore, Gleason scores cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices such as “maligniteeteista” (instead of “maligniteeteistä”) are acceptable within the domain.
