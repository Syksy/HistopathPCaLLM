#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ETURAUHASNÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type is only partially assessable.

#3: No  
#4: The text states “löydettiin sekalaista tulehdusjäännöstä” (mixed inflammatory residue was found) and “Löydökset epävarmoja” (findings are uncertain). There is no mention of prostate adenocarcinoma or any malignant diagnosis, only inconclusive inflammatory changes. Thus, malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the formatting is awkward (e.g., empty fields “T= , , M =”). “ANTERIORINEN RASVA” should probably be “ANTERIORINEN RASVAKUDOS” for clarity. Overall, the meaning is clear to a lay reader, but minor grammatical and formatting issues are present.
