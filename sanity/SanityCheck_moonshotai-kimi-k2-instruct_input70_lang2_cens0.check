#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement states that “hittas ingen lämning av malignitet” (no remnants of malignancy are found) and that only benign features are present. This confirms that the findings are benign rather than malignant.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignancy is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “hittas ingen lämning av malignitet” instead of “ingen malignitet påträffades”). The overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
