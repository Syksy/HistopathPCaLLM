#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “Prostataprov” (prostate specimen/sample) and “Prostata” (prostate), which clearly indicates the material is from the prostate. However, it does not specify whether the sample is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Osäkert av fynd” (findings uncertain) and asks for discussion at MDT (multidisciplinary team). There is no statement confirming either malignant or benign findings; the status is left undetermined.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The language is understandable but contains minor grammatical/spelling issues (e.g., “infammation” should be “inflammation”, “Osäkert av fynd” is slightly awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
