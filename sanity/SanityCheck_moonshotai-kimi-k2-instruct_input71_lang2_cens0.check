#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips/shavings), which is a standard term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly states “Ingen malignitet” (no malignancy), so the malignant status is unambiguous.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence Gleason scores cannot and need not be provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalised “SAMMANFATTNING” and the use of “T=…, M=…” are common in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
