#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly states “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The summary states “AINOASTAAN BENIGN PIIRTEITÄ” (only benign features) and both left and right sides are described as benign cylinders with no invasive malignancy, PIN, or inflammation. Therefore malignancy status is unambiguously assessed as absent.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; hence Gleason scores cannot and need not be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is concise, uses standard Finnish medical terminology, and is readily understandable to clinicians or informed laypersons.
