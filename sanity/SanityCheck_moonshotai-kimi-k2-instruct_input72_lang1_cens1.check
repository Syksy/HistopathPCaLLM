#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “fragmentoitunutta eturauhasnäytettä” (fragmented prostate samples) and “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side shows “PIN-muutoksia” (PIN changes) and “muita muodostumia” (other formations), which raises suspicion of neoplasia, but no explicit statement of adenocarcinoma is given. The right side is explicitly negative. Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor clearly ruled out for the left side, the malignancy status is only partially assessable.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided or implied anywhere in the text.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology; a layman might need clarification on “PIN-muutoksia” and “muodostumia,” but the overall grammar and clarity are acceptable.
