#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostatbiopsier” (prostate biopsies) and the left/right descriptions refer to fragmented and intact cores, so the sample type is clearly biopsy material.

#3: Yes  
#4: The summary states “endast benign egenskaper” (only benign features) and each side is described as benign with no mention of malignancy, PIN, or invasive cancer. Therefore the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no adenocarcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence no Gleason scores are provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish is concise and understandable; minor non-standard phrasing (“fragmenterad benign cylindrar” instead of “fragmenterade benigna cylindrar”) is acceptable in this clinical context and does not impede comprehension.
