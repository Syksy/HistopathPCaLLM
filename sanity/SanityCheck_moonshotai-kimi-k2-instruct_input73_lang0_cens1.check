#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “PROSTATE” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (apex/base margins, circumferential margin, seminal-vesicle invasion, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so we can only infer it is most likely a radical prostatectomy.

#3: No  
#4: Although the template contains fields for Gleason pattern and score, every value is left blank. The summary line ends with “GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” (empty) and “Nx (UICC TNM 8th edition)”, which does not confirm malignancy. Therefore we cannot determine whether malignant findings were present.

#5: No  
#6: The Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and overall score) are all empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains several spelling/grammar issues (“determin”, “RPOSTATE”, missing punctuation). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they should be corrected for clarity.
