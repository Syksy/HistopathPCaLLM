#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (capsule, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, margins, dominant nodule, etc.). Although the word “radikaaliprostektomia” is not written, the context makes the sample type unambiguous.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report repeatedly leaves the Gleason score blank and states “ETURAUHASNÄYTE – , GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” This phrasing neither confirms malignancy nor explicitly denies it; it merely indicates that no cancer was identified or that the data were not recorded. Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully assessed.

#5: No  
#6: The fields for primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason patterns are all empty and the final summary lists “GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .” No numeric values are provided, so a major+minor=sum triplet cannot be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The report is understandable, but the repeated commas without values (“GLEASON SCORE , GRADE GROUP .”) and the slightly awkward “ETURAUHANEN” heading instead of “Radikaaliprostektomia” could confuse a lay reader. Minor re-phrasing (e.g. “Gleason-arvoa ei voitu määrittää”) would improve clarity.
