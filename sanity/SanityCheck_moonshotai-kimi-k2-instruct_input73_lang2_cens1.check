#1: Partially  
#2: The text lists “PROSTATA” as a heading, which strongly implies that the specimen is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether the sample comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.

#3: No  
#4: Although the form contains fields for Gleason grades and tumour characteristics, every field is left blank or marked “Nej”. The summary line ends with “PROSTATAPROV - , GLEASON SCORE, GRADE GROUP .” – essentially an empty template. Because no malignant (or benign) diagnosis is actually written, the malignancy status cannot be assessed from the text.

#5: No  
#6: The primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason grades are all missing, and the Gleason score field is empty. Without any numeric values provided, the Gleason pattern (major+minor=sum) cannot be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable, but the repeated blank fields and the truncated summary (“PROSTATAPROV - , GLEASON SCORE, GRADE GROUP .”) make the statement look like an unfilled template rather than a complete report. Minor grammatical omissions (e.g., missing verbs or values) slightly reduce clarity for a lay reader.
