#1: Yes  
#2: The phrase “prostate chippings” clearly indicates that the specimen is a transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P/TURP) specimen, commonly referred to as “chippings” or “chips.”  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly states “No invasive disease,” which confirms that no invasive carcinoma was found. The presence of PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is noted, but PIN is not invasive malignancy. Therefore, the malignancy status is assessable as negative for invasive cancer.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or required. Consequently, Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is concise and understandable, using standard histopathology terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., capitalization of “SUMMARY”) are acceptable in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
