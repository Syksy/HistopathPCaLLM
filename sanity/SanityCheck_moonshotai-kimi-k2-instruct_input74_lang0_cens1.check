#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” and “blocks,” which implies that the material is histological tissue, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be partially assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Cannot decide on type of invasive disease,” which means malignancy (adenocarcinoma) has neither been confirmed nor ruled out. Only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is reported, and PIN is not invasive carcinoma. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: Because no invasive adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable. The text therefore offers no basis for determining major, minor, or sum Gleason scores.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The spelling “sampes” should be “samples,” and the phrase “Cannot decide on type of invasive disease” is slightly awkward; “Cannot determine the presence or type of invasive carcinoma” would be clearer. Overall the meaning is understandable, but these minor issues slightly detract from perfect clarity.
