#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and “blokissa” (in the block), so we know the material is prostatic tissue, but it does not specify whether the samples are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Ei voida määrittää invasiivisen taudin tyyppiä” (the type of invasive disease cannot be determined) and only reports PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). Therefore we cannot conclude whether invasive carcinoma is present or absent; the malignancy status remains indeterminate.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the presence of PIN alone does not allow any Gleason score to be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is concise and understandable; only minor stylistic omissions (e.g., missing article before “blokissa”) are typical of pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
