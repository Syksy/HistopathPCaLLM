#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and “block”, which implies tissue blocks from a prostate specimen, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Kan inte avslutas typ av invasiv sjukdom” (“Cannot conclude type of invasive disease”). Only PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) is reported, which is a pre-malignant change, not invasive carcinoma. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and no invasive carcinoma is identified. Therefore Gleason grading is not assessable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The wording is understandable to a layman, but the sentence structure is slightly telegraphic (“Ses fokusområden av PIN”). A clearer phrasing would be “Fokala områden med PIN ses” (“Focal areas of PIN are seen”).
