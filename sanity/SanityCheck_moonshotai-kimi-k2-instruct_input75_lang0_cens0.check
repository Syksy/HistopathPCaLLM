#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate cores” and “prostate biopsies,” clearly indicating that the sample type is needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “no invasive malignancy” on both sides and only mentions PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), which is not invasive cancer. Therefore, the findings are benign (no malignant adenocarcinoma).  

#5: No  
#6: Because no invasive prostate adenocarcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or applicable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and understandable; minor shorthand (e.g., “T=77100, M=09450”) is acceptable in pathology reports.
