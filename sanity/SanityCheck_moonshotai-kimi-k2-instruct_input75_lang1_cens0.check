#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly states “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and the left/right descriptions confirm that the material consists of needle-core biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report clearly states that no invasive malignancy was found; only high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is present on the left side, while the right side is entirely benign. Thus malignancy status is assessable as negative.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading is provided or implied, because no invasive adenocarcinoma was identified. Gleason scores are only assigned to malignant (invasive) tissue.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is concise and uses standard Finnish histopathology terminology. While abbreviations such as “PIN” and the numeric codes (T=77100, M=09450) may not be immediately clear to a layman, they are conventional in pathology reports and the overall message is understandable.
