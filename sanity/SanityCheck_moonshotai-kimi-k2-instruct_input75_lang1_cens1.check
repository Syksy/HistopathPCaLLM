#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatanäytteitä / prostatanäytettä” (prostate samples) and “6 prostatanäytettä” (6 prostate samples), so we know the material is prostate tissue, but it does not specify whether these are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens.  

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side is reported to show “PIN-muutoksia” (PIN changes), which are atypical but not overtly malignant. No mention of adenocarcinoma is made. The right side states that changes “ei ole mahdollista määrittää” (cannot be determined). Thus malignancy status is inconclusive rather than clearly benign or malignant.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text. PIN alone does not yield a Gleason grade.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable but contains shorthand and fragmented sentences (e.g., “T=, M=”). A layman would grasp the gist, yet clearer wording such as “vasemmanpuoleisissa näytteissä todettiin PIN-muutoksia, mutta ei adenokarsinoomaa” would improve readability.
