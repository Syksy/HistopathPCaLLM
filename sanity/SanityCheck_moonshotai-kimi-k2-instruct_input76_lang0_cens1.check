#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and lists radical-prostatectomy-specific landmarks (apex margin, base margin, circumferential margin, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, etc.), so it is almost certainly a radical prostatectomy specimen. However, the word “prostatectomy” itself is never stated, so the sample type is only implicitly rather than explicitly given.

#3: No  
#4: Although the report repeatedly refers to “tumour”, it never actually confirms that malignant prostate adenocarcinoma is present. All fields that should contain the diagnosis (Tumour type, Description, Findings) are left blank or say “unable to decide on changes, grade group”. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from the text.

#5: No  
#6: Every Gleason-related field (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary patterns and Gleason score) is empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall meaning is understandable, but there are several spelling/grammar slips (“determin”, “dicid”, missing articles, inconsistent punctuation). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, yet a lay reader might be confused by phrases such as “unable to dicid on changes”.
