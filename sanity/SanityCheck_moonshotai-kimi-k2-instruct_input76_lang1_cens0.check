#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides multiple malignant descriptors (extraprostatic extension, positive apex margin, perineural invasion), confirming malignancy.

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 3, the secondary as 4, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7, so the format 3+4=7 is directly available.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are appropriate for a pathology report. Minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “ANTERIORINEN RASVA”) and occasional Finnish terms do not impede understanding for a lay reader familiar with medical reports.
