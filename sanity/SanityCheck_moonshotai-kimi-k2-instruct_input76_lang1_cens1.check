#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ETURAUHASEN RASVAKUDOS” (periprostatic adipose tissue), which clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy.  

#3: No  
#4: Although the report lists all the fields required for a prostatectomy report, every field that would indicate malignancy (tumour type, Gleason scores, tumour size, extraprostatic extension, margin status, etc.) is either left blank or stated as “Ei voida määrittää muutoksia” (changes cannot be determined). The summary states “PUHDAS” (clean) for the adipose tissue and margins, but does not confirm the presence or absence of carcinoma in the prostate itself. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, overall Gleason score) are empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which Gleason scores could be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is standard Finnish medical terminology and is understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge. Minor stylistic omissions (e.g., missing punctuation after “GRADE GROUP”) do not impede comprehension.
