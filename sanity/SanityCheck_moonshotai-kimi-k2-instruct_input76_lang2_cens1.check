#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy template (apex, base, peripheral, anterior margins, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated (e.g. “radical prostatectomy specimen”), so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.

#3: No  
#4: All Gleason fields are left blank (“Primär Gleason grad:”, “Sekundär Gleason grad:”, “Gleason score:”, “Grade Group”). The summary explicitly says “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ FÖRÄNDRINGAR, GRADE GROUP.” Therefore, malignancy status cannot be determined from the text.

#5: No  
#6: No numerical Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the report states that changes and grade group “cannot be determined.” Consequently, Gleason score cannot be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The report is understandable, but it contains several minor grammatical and stylistic issues (e.g., “Fynd invecklar fettvävnad” should probably be “fynd innefattar fettvävnad”; “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ FÖRÄNDRINGAR” is missing a preposition). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader but are noticeable.
