#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostate chippings,” which is a standard histopathology term for transurethral resection (TURP) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement explicitly states “No malignancy seen” and concludes with “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). This unambiguously indicates benign findings with no evidence of malignancy.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy is reported, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is concise, grammatically correct, and understandable to both clinicians and lay readers.
