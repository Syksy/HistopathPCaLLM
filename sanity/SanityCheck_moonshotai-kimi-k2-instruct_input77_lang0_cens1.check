#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” and “blocks,” which implies that tissue has been received and processed, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  

#3: No  
#4: The description lists “glandular and stromal hyperplasia and other changes,” which are benign findings. There is no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is clear and understandable, although the line “T=, M=” is incomplete and cryptic; however, this does not render the statement incomprehensible.
