#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates the sample type is TUR-P (transurethral resection of the prostate).  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Ei havaittu maligniteettia” (no malignancy observed) and the summary lists “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore, the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=77100, M=72440” are standard pathology codes and do not impede comprehension.
