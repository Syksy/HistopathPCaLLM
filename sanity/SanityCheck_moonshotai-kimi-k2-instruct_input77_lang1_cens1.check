#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate specimens), so it is clear that the material is prostate tissue. However, no specific sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The description speaks of “rauhasten ja stroomien hyperplasiaa” (glandular and stromal hyperplasia) and “muita muutoksia” (other changes), which are benign findings. There is no mention of malignancy, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed as present.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, Gleason grading is not mentioned and cannot be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the phrase “edustavasti tutkittu blokeissa” is slightly awkward; “edustavasti” is likely intended to mean “representatively” or “adequately,” but the more standard wording would be “edustavasti tutkittu kudoslohkoissa” or “edustavasti tutkittu leikkeissä.” The line “T=, M=” is left empty, which is acceptable as a placeholder but could be clarified.
