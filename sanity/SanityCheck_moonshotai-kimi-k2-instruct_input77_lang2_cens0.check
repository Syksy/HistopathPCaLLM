#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Prostataspån” (prostate chips), which is the Swedish term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. This clearly identifies the sample type.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “Upptäcks ingen malignitet” (no malignancy detected) and the summary lists “BPH” (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore, the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignancy was found, Gleason grading is not relevant; hence it cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is concise and understandable. Minor non-standard phrasing such as “Ses områden körtlars och stromas hyperplasi” is acceptable in pathology reports; it conveys that areas of glandular and stromal hyperplasia are seen.
