#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate sample) and “undersöks representativt i block” (examined representatively in blocks), which implies a tissue specimen, but it does not specify whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes “körtels och stromas hyperplasi” (glandular and stromal hyperplasia) and “några förändringar” (some changes), but no mention of malignancy or prostate adenocarcinoma is provided. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant findings are reported, Gleason grading is not applicable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but slightly telegraphic; “körtlars” would be the correct genitive form instead of “körtels”, and “några förändringar” is vague. Overall the message is clear to a lay reader, but minor grammatical adjustments would improve clarity.
