#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostate biopsies” and lists left- and right-sided cores, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side is reported as benign. The right side contains ASAP and PIN, which are not unequivocally malignant; ASAP is suspicious but falls short of carcinoma. Therefore malignancy cannot be fully confirmed or ruled out.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading is provided, nor can it be inferred, because no definite adenocarcinoma is diagnosed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is clear, concise, and uses standard terminology (ASAP, PIN) that is understandable to clinicians and informed patients.
