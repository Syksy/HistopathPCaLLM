#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” from both left and right sides, but it does not explicitly state whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The plural “samples” suggests multiple fragments, most consistent with needle biopsies, yet this is only inferred, not declared.

#3: Partially  
#4: A cluster of atypical glands is described, but the report explicitly says it is “unable to determine whether malignancy” and considers the possibility of ASAP adjacent to PIN. Therefore malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out; the statement is inconclusive.

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason grade is assigned or implied. Consequently, major + minor = sum cannot be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The wording is understandable but contains grammatical lapses (“to considered as an area…”) and odd abbreviations (“T=, M=”). A lay reader would grasp the gist, yet the phrasing could be smoother (e.g., “considered to be an area of atypical small acinar proliferation”).
