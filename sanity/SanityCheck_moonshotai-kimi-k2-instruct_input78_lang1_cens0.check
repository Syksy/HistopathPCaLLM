#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIA” (prostate biopsy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that the glands are “moderately atypical” and “not malignant,” but it also mentions ASAP (atypical small acinar proliferation) and PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). These are premalignant or suspicious findings rather than overt malignancy. Therefore, malignancy status is not definitively established.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is provided or can be inferred from the text.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is grammatically correct and understandable, using standard medical terminology.
