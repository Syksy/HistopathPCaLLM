#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytettä” (prostate samples) and distinguishes “VASEN” and “OIKEA” (left and right), but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: The pathologist explicitly states they “cannot determine whether [the findings] are malignant or relate to atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) associated with PIN.” Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can any be inferred from the description.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and grammatically acceptable for a pathology report. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “prostatanäytettä” without an article) are typical in medical Finnish and do not impede understanding.
