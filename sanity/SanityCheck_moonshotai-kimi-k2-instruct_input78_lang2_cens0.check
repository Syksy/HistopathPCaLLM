#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATABIOPSI” (prostate biopsy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Partially  
#4: The right-side biopsy shows atypical glands lacking basal cells (ASAP/PIN), which is a premalignant finding rather than overt malignancy. No prostate adenocarcinoma is reported, so malignancy status cannot be fully assessed as “malignant”.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading is provided or implied; the findings are ASAP/PIN, not adenocarcinoma, so Gleason scores are not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and uses standard terminology (ASAP, PIN). Minor Swedish abbreviations (e.g., “cylindrar”) are understandable in context.
