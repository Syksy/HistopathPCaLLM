#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly states “prostata prov” (prostate specimen) for both left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identifiable as prostate biopsies.

#3: Partially  
#4: The pathologist describes a 0.3 mm cluster of atypical glands lacking basal cells, raising suspicion for malignancy or ASAP/PIN, but explicitly states that malignancy “cannot be determined.” Therefore malignancy status is inconclusive rather than confirmed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the description.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Kan inte determineras” should be “kan inte fastställas” or “kan inte avgöras”; “relaterar till” is repeated awkwardly). Overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
