#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which implies the material is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively determined.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Tumour type: Unable to recognise” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES – UNABLE TO DEFINE DUE TO THE SAMPLE CANTAMINATION.” Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded, the malignancy status is unassessable.  

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” or left blank, and the tumour type itself is declared unrecognisable. Consequently, no Gleason pattern or score can be extracted.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but it contains spelling errors (“cantamination” should be “contamination”) and inconsistent punctuation (e.g., missing spaces after colons). These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
