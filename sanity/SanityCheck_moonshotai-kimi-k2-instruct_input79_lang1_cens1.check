#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), which clearly indicates the material is prostate tissue. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Kasvaintyyppi: Ei pystytty tunnistamaan” (tumour type: could not be identified) and the final summary says the prostate samples “EI VOITU MÄÄRITTÄÄ NÄYTEKONTAMINAATION TAKIA” (could not be determined due to sample contamination). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” (missing). Since malignancy itself could not be determined, no Gleason pattern or score can be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are standard Finnish pathological reporting language. While a layman might need help with some terms (e.g., “perineuraalinen invaasio”), the overall structure and clarity are appropriate for the intended medical audience.
