#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary section, so the sample type is unambiguous.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states “Prostatas adenocarcinoma” and lists malignant features such as Gleason score, tumour size, and perineural invasion. There is no ambiguity about the presence of malignancy.

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason grade is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the total Gleason score is stated as 7. This directly translates to 4 + 3 = 7, satisfying the required format.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but it contains several non-standard or awkward phrases (e.g., “oväsentlig negativ lymfkörtel,” “Ställe av närmaste plats,” “T=77000, 1X010, M = 81403”). These do not impede comprehension for a domain reader but would benefit from minor grammatical polishing for a lay audience.
