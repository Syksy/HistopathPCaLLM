#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as “PROSTATA” (prostate) and mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen/sample). Although it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, the detailed examination of margins, seminal vesicles, bladder neck, and capsular penetration implies a radical prostatectomy specimen. Thus, the sample type can be assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Tumör typ: Kunde inte erkännas” (tumor type could not be identified) and “PROSTATA PROV - KUNDE INTE BESTÄMMAS PÅ GRUND AV PROVKONTAMINATION” (prostate specimen could not be determined due to specimen contamination). Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether malignant findings are present or not.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grades and Gleason score) are marked with dashes (“-”), indicating that no Gleason grading could be assigned. Consequently, the Gleason score in the format major+minor=sum cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are appropriate for a pathology report. While some phrasing is slightly non-standard (e.g., “Ställe av närmaste plats”), this is acceptable within the domain. The text is comprehensible to a layman with minimal medical knowledge.
