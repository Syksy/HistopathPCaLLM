#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate sample material” and “routinely collected,” which implies a biopsy or similar specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “no definite conclusions could be drawn” and that the rest of the material was typical. This means malignancy was neither confirmed nor ruled out; the findings are inconclusive rather than benign. Hence, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis was rendered, no Gleason score (major + minor = sum) is provided or inferable. The score is therefore not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear, grammatically correct, and understandable to a layperson. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “diminishingly small”) are acceptable in a pathology context.
