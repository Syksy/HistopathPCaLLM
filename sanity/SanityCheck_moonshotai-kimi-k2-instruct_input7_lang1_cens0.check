#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatabiopsiat” (prostate biopsies) taken in the usual manner, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes a suspicious focus with nuclear atypia that “might correspond to adenocarcinoma,” but it is explicitly stated that “no clear adenocarcinoma was found.” Therefore, malignancy is not confirmed; only suspicion is raised.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided or can be inferred from the text, because no definite carcinoma was identified.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable, using standard Finnish medical terminology. There are no grammatical errors that impede comprehension.
