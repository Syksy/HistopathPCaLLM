#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytemateriaalia” (prostate sample material) and that it was collected according to routine instructions, but it never explicitly states whether the material came from biopsies, TURP, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “prostate tissue” without a more specific source.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes “atyyppisia rakenteita ja morfologisia muutoksia” (atypical structures and morphological changes) but immediately concludes that the finding was “häviävän pieni” (vanishingly small) and that “mitään definitiittiä johtopäätöstä … ei voitu tekan” (no definitive conclusion could be drawn). Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor ruled out, the malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which these could be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is grammatically correct and understandable to a lay reader. Domain-specific phrasing such as “atyyppisia rakenteita” is acceptable in a pathology report.
