#1: No  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” generically, but it never specifies whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical-prostatectomy specimen. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be determined.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement lists “chronic inflammation” and “suspicious findings,” but explicitly says the samples are “contaminated and cannot be examined further.” No malignant diagnosis (e.g., adenocarcinoma) is confirmed, nor is benign status unequivocally stated. Thus malignancy status is unassessable.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is identified, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable overall, but contains spelling errors (“imflammation,” “examned”) and awkward phrasing (“some mix findings”). These are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
