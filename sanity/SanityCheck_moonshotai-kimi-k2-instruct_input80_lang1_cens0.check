#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which is the Finnish term for TUR-P (transurethral resection) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The summary states “vain benign piirteitä” (only benign features) and “näkyvillä vain benign tunnusmerkkejä” (only benign characteristics visible). This unambiguously indicates that no malignancy was found.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since the findings are explicitly benign, no Gleason grading is provided or required; Gleason scores are only relevant for malignant tissue.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable despite minor spelling issues (“inflamamatiota” should be “inflammaatiota”). The overall meaning is clear to a lay reader.
