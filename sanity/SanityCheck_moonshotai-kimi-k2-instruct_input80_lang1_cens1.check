#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they were examined “kokonaan blokeissa” (in blocks), which implies a biopsy or TURP setting, but the exact sample type (biopsy vs. TURP vs. RP) is never explicitly stated.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states that the samples were “kontaminoituneet” (contaminated) and therefore “tutkimuksia ei voida jatkaa” (examination cannot be continued). No malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; only “epäilyttäviä löytöjä” (suspicious findings) and “kroonista inflammaatiota” (chronic inflammation) are mentioned, which does not allow a determination of malignancy.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy cannot be assessed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical phrasing. Minor stylistic issues (e.g., “T=, M=” is left blank) do not impede comprehension.
