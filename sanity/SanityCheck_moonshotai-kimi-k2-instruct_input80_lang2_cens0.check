#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “prostataspån” (prostate chips), which clearly identifies the specimen as TUR-P (transurethral resection) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The summary states “bara benigna egenskaper” (only benign features) and “syns bara benign tecken” (only benign signs are seen), so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.

#6: Because no carcinoma is present, no Gleason grading is provided or required; therefore the Gleason score cannot be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and domain-appropriate; any lay reader would understand that the chips were examined and found benign.
