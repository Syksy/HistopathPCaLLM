#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that the entire specimen has been examined in blocks, which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  

#3: No  
#4: The summary only lists “några diverse fynd” (various findings) and mentions chronic inflammation and “suspekt fynd” (suspicious findings), but no malignant diagnosis is given. Because the examination could not be completed due to contamination, malignancy status remains undetermined.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is neither reported nor inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and concise; minor non-standard abbreviations (e.g., “T=, M=”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
