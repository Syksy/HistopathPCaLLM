#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the sample as “prostate biopsies” (cores from left and right sides), so the type of specimen is unambiguous.

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignancy is explicitly reported: two cores on the right show infiltrating acinar adenocarcinoma, while the left-sided cores are benign. Thus, the presence/absence of malignancy is fully assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is given directly as 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3), satisfying the requirement for major + minor = sum.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is clear, concise, and uses standard terminology understandable to both clinicians and informed laypersons. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “RIGHT SIDED ADENOCARCINOMA”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
