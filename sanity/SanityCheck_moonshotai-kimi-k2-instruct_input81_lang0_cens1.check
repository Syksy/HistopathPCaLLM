#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes “LEFT” from “RIGHT,” which implies that the material comes from a prostate biopsy set. However, the exact specimen type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: The RIGHT side is described as having “mix findings which is not clear (due to samples contaminaton)” and the summary states “SOME FINDINGS … MORE EXAMINATION IS NEEDED.” These phrases indicate that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the findings are inconclusive. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) is provided or can be inferred from the text. The statement explicitly calls for “MORE EXAMINATION,” so no grading information is available.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but contains minor grammatical issues such as “mix findings which is not clear,” “samples contaminaton,” and “T=, M=” without explanation. These do not render the text incomprehensible, but a lay reader might find the phrasing awkward.
