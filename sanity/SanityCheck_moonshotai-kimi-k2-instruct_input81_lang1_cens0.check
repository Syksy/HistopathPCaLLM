#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and describes findings from both left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are explicitly stated: “infiltroitunut asinaarisella adenokarsinoomalla” (infiltrated by acinar adenocarcinoma) in the right-sided samples, while the left side is benign. Thus malignancy status is unambiguous.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly: “primääri Gleason arvo 4, sekundääri 3” and summarised as “MAKSIMI GLEASON SCORE 7 (4+3)”. This provides major + minor = sum (4+3=7) in standard format.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in clear Finnish medical terminology. While abbreviations like “PIN” and codes “T=77100, M=81403” may not be familiar to laypersons, the overall structure and language are appropriate for a pathology report.
