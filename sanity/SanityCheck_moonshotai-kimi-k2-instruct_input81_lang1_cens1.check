#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytteitä” (prostate samples) and distinguishes between left and right sides, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy). Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as prostate biopsies, not unambiguously confirmed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement does not declare the findings benign or malignant. It mentions “PIN” (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) and “sekalaisia löytöjä” (miscellaneous findings) that are “vaikea tulkita” (difficult to interpret). PIN is a premalignant change, not overt carcinoma, and the rest is inconclusive. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no adenocarcinoma is reported, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “sekalaisia löytöjä”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
