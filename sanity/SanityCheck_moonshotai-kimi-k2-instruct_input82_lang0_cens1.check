#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which implies the material is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the exact sample type is only partially discernible.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “No evidence of malignancy” in the anterior fat and repeatedly uses placeholders (“-”) or “not decided” for tumour type and Gleason elements. The summary further states the prostate samples are “UNCLEAR AND MIX FINDING” and need re-examination. Consequently, the presence or absence of malignancy cannot be definitively assessed from this report.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and overall score) are marked “-” or “not decided.” No numerical values or patterns are provided, so the Gleason score in the required format cannot be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and wording are understandable and typical for a pathology report. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., “Samples need to be study again”) do not impede comprehension.
