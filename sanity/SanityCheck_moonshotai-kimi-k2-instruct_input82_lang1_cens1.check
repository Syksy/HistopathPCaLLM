#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATARASVA”, which clearly indicate that the material is from the prostate. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimens are biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy specimen. Therefore, the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says “Ei viitteitä mistään malignista” (no evidence of malignancy) for the anterior fat, but for the prostate specimens it concludes “EPÄSELVÄT JA SEKALAISET LÖYDÖKSET, VAATII LISÄTUTKIMUKSIA” (unclear and mixed findings, requires further studies). Because the findings are inconclusive, malignancy cannot be assessed as either present or absent.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields are marked “Ei määritetty” (not determined) or “-”. No numerical values or patterns are provided, so the Gleason score cannot be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are standard medical Finnish and would be understandable to a clinician. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalisation and hyphen usage are acceptable in pathology reports.
