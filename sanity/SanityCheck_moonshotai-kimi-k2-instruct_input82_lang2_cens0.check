#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy) and lists separate specimens such as “ANTERIORISKT FETT” and “PROSTATA”, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement clearly indicates malignancy: “Tumörtyp: Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” and the summary confirms “PROSTATAS ADENOCARCINOMA”.

#5: Yes  
#6: Both primary and secondary Gleason grades are given (4 and 4), and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8, so the format 4+4=8 is directly inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is written in understandable Swedish with only minor grammatical quirks (e.g., “Ställe av närmaste plats” instead of “Plats för närmaste marginal”), but these do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
