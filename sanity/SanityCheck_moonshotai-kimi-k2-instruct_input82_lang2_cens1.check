#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV”, which clearly indicates that the material examined is prostatic tissue. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Inga tecken av malignitet” (no signs of malignancy) and leaves all tumour-related fields blank or marked “Inte bestämd” (not determined). Because the findings are inconclusive and require re-examination, we cannot definitively say whether the tissue is benign or malignant; the status is therefore unassessable.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no tumour was identified and all Gleason-related fields are either blank or marked “Inte bestämd”, there is no basis for assigning a Gleason score. Consequently, Gleason assessment is not applicable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are standard for a Swedish pathology report. While lay readers may need help with some terms (e.g., “seminalvehikeln”), the overall language is clear and appropriate for the intended medical audience.
