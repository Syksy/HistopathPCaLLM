#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they were examined “kokonaan blokeissa” (entirely in blocks), which implies a histopathology specimen set. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the exact sample type remains unspecified.  

#3: No  
#4: The summary line “SEKALAISIA LÖYDÖKSIÄ, TARVITAAN JATKOTUTKIMUKSIA” (“mixed findings, further studies needed”) explicitly indicates that no definitive benign or malignant diagnosis has been reached. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy status itself is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and concise; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are typical shorthand in pathology reports and do not impede understanding.
