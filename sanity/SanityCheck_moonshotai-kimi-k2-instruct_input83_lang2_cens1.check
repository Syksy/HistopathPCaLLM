#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostataprov” (prostate specimen) and that it has been “undersökts i sin helhet i blok” (examined in its entirety in blocks), which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.).  

#3: No  
#4: The summary line “DIVERSE FYND, BEHÖVS YTTERLIGARE EXAMINATION” (various findings, further examination needed) explicitly indicates that no definitive benign or malignant conclusion has been reached. Therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy status is undetermined, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are domain-specific and acceptable.
