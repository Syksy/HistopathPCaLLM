#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes between “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, but it never explicitly states whether these samples come from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side is described as having “suspicious changes” and possible perineural invasion, but the wording “suspicious” and “might be” stops short of confirming malignancy. The right side is explicitly benign with PIN (high-grade PIN is not invasive carcinoma). Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: The summary explicitly states “UNABLE TO DECIDE MAXIMUM GLEASON SCORE AND GRADE GROUP”, so no Gleason pattern (major+minor=sum) can be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but the phrase “LEFT … infiltrated by some suspicious changes” is awkward; “infiltrated by” should be “show” or “contain”. “RIGHT sided PIN” should be “RIGHT-sided PIN”. These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension.
