#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “ETURAUHASBIOPSIAT” (prostate biopsies) and distinguishes between left and right sides, so the sample type is clearly identified as needle biopsies.

#3: Yes  
#4: Malignant findings are reported on the left side: “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) is stated, along with Gleason scores and additional malignant features such as perineural invasion. The right side is described as benign. Therefore, malignancy status is fully assessable.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “primääri Gleason arvo 3 ja sekundääri 3” and summarized as “Gleason score 6 (3+3)”. Thus, major + minor = sum (3+3=6) is explicitly provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in clear Finnish medical terminology. While some abbreviations (e.g., “T=77100, M=81403”) are cryptic to a layman, the core histopathological information is understandable and the grammar is correct.
