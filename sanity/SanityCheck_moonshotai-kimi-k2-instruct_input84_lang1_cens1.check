#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly refers to “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes between left and right sides, indicating that the material consists of prostate biopsies.

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side is described as having “epäilyttäviä löydöksiä” (suspicious findings) with possible perineural invasion, strongly suggesting malignancy, but the wording remains tentative (“saattaa olla”). The right side is explicitly benign with PIN changes. Because malignancy is not unequivocally confirmed, the assessment can only be partial.

#5: No  
#6: The summary explicitly states “EI VOIDA MÄÄRITTÄÄ MAKSIMI GLEASON SCOREA JA GRADE GROUPIA” (maximum Gleason score and grade group cannot be determined), so no valid Gleason pattern can be extracted.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable; minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “benign” instead of “benignit”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not impede comprehension.
