#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate specimen) and distinguishes between left and right sides, implying a bilateral biopsy or TURP-type sampling. However, the exact procedure (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: Partially  
#4: The left side is described as having “några suspekt fynd” (some suspicious findings) with possible perineural invasion, strongly suggesting malignancy, yet no definitive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is given. The right side is explicitly benign with PIN. Because malignancy is only suspected and not confirmed, the malignancy status can only be partially assessed.

#5: No  
#6: The summary explicitly states “KAN INTE BESTÄMMAS MAX GLEASON SCORE OCH GRADE GROUP” (maximum Gleason score and grade group cannot be determined). No Gleason pattern numbers are provided anywhere, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains grammatical oddities (e.g., “infiltrerades sig” should be “infiltrerades” or “visade infiltration”; “Hittas PIN-förändringar” should be “PIN-förändringar påträffades”). These issues are minor and do not prevent comprehension.
