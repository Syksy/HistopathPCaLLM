#3: Yes  
#4: The presence of “Acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma” is explicitly stated, along with extensive malignant features (extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, positive margins). Therefore, malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason pattern is given as 4, the secondary as 5, and the tertiary pattern (3) is explicitly excluded from grading. The Gleason score is stated as 9. Thus, the Gleason information is complete and directly inferable as 4 + 5 = 9.
