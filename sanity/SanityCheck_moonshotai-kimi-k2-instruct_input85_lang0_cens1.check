#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATE” and “SEPARATE LEFT SEMINAL VESICLE FRAGMENT”, which implies a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it never explicitly states the sample type. Therefore the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Tumour type: Unclear” and “Need further examination”. Because malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out, the malignancy status is not assessable.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern numbers or scores are provided; all relevant fields are left blank. Thus the Gleason score cannot be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is understandable despite some non-standard punctuation and capitalization. A lay reader could grasp that the findings are inconclusive and further work-up is needed.
