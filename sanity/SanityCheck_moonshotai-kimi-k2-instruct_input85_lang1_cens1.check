#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), which clearly indicates the organ examined, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Kasvaimen tyyppi: Epäselvä” (tumour type unclear) and “EI VOIDA VARMISTAA LÖYDÖKSIÄ” (findings cannot be confirmed). These phrases indicate that malignancy cannot be assessed from the information provided.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primäärinen, sekundäärinen, tertiäärinen, Gleason score) are left blank. No numerical or descriptive Gleason information is supplied, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but it contains inconsistent punctuation (e.g., “Ympärysmarginaali:,” with a trailing comma) and some abbreviations or shorthand that may confuse lay readers. The phrase “Vaatii lisätutkimuksia” is clear, yet the overall structure could be improved for readability.
