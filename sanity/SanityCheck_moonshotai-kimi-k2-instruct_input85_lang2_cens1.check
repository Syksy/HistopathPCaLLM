#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV”, which clearly points to a prostate specimen, but it never explicitly states whether this is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: No  
#4: The report repeatedly states that the tumour type is “Oklart” (unclear) and that the findings “KUNDE INTE BESTÄMMAS” (could not be determined). No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given; the case is inconclusive and requires further investigation. Hence malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, and total score) are left blank. No numerical or descriptive Gleason information is provided, so the Gleason score cannot be assessed.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and vocabulary are typical of Swedish pathology reports and are understandable to a professional reader. While lay readers might struggle with abbreviations like “UICC TNM 8th edition”, the language is otherwise appropriate for the domain.
