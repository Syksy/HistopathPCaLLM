#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which are standard terms for transurethral resection (TURP) specimens. Therefore the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “approximately 8 of 104 chips contain Gleason 4+3=7 prostatic adenocarcinoma” and the summary line confirms “ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 7 (4 + 3) GRADE GROUP 3.” Thus malignancy is unequivocally reported.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “4+3=7” in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum scores are fully available.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The wording is concise and understandable; minor stylistic choices such as “chippings” instead of “chips” are acceptable in pathology reports. No grammatical errors impede comprehension.
