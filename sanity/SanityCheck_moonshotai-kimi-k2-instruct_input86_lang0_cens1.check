#1: No  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” but never specifies whether these are needle biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. No operative procedure or specimen type is given.  

#3: No  
#4: The statement only says “suspicious changes” and “UNCLEAR FINDINGS.” It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; therefore the malignant status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy is not established, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The wording is understandable but slightly awkward (“approximately 8 samples contain some suspicious changes” could be clearer as “approximately 8 of the samples show suspicious changes”). The summary line “T=, M=” is cryptic and should be expanded or omitted.
