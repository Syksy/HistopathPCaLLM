#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), and the context (TUR-P codes T=77100, M=81403) confirms that the sample type is transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement clearly reports the presence of adenocarcinoma (“eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa”) in 8 of 104 chips and repeats this in the summary (“ADENOKARSINOOMA”).  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 4 + 3 = 7 (Grade Group 3) in both the narrative and the summary, so the major, minor and sum scores are directly inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is concise and domain-appropriate; minor Finnish abbreviations (e.g., “lastut”, “eli noin”) are acceptable in a pathology report and do not impede understanding.
