#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only says that “about 8 samples contain suspicious changes” and that the findings are “unclear / inconclusive” (“epäselvät löydökset”). There is no confirmation of malignancy, nor a definitive statement that the findings are benign. Hence malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy is neither confirmed nor denied, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and concise; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are domain-specific and acceptable in a pathology summary.
