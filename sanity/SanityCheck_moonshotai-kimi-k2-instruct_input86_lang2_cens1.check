#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate samples) and that “cirka 8 prov” are examined, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TUR-P chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore, the sample type is only partially inferable.

#3: No  
#4: The summary states “OKLARA FYND” (unclear findings) and “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) without confirming malignancy. Suspicion is not a definitive malignant diagnosis, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, and the findings are explicitly described as unclear, making Gleason assessment impossible.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable within a medical context. Minor stylistic choices like “Prov undersöks i sin helhet” are acceptable in pathology reports.
