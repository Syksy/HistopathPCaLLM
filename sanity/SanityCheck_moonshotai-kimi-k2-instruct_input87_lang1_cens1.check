#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and describes six samples from the left side and seven from the right side, clearly indicating that the material consists of prostate biopsies.  

#3: No  
#4: Although suspicious infiltrative changes are described, the report explicitly states that the findings are “epäselviä” (unclear) and that “lisäperehtyminen tarpeen” (further work-up is needed). No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is rendered; therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no definite adenocarcinoma is diagnosed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable, with only minor typographical issues (“maksimipiruus” likely intended “maksimipituus”). Overall it is appropriate for clinical communication.
