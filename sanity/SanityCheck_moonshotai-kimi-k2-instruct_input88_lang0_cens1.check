#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “PROSTATE” and “PROSTATE SAMPLES,” which clearly indicates that the material examined is prostatic tissue. Although the exact source (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is not specified, the context is unambiguous.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that the tumour type is “UNCLEAR” and that findings are “UNCLEAR AND SUSPICIOUS.” While malignancy is not confirmed, the use of the word “suspicious” implies that malignancy cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the malignancy status is not definitively assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary patterns and Gleason score) are marked with dashes (“-”), indicating that no Gleason information is provided or can be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are standard for a pathology report. While lay readers may need clarification on some terms (e.g., “UICC TNM 8th edition”), the overall language is appropriate for the intended medical audience.
