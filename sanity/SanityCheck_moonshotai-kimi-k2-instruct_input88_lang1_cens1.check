#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (margins, seminal-vesicle invasion, etc.), which implies the sample is prostate tissue. However, it never explicitly states whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be inferred, not definitively assessed.  

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Kasvaintyyppi: EPÄSELVÄ” (tumour type unclear) and “EI voida määrittää löydöksiä” (findings cannot be determined). Therefore malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings are inconclusive.  

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields are marked “-” (missing). Because no tumour was identified, no Gleason pattern or score can be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is standard medical Finnish and understandable to a layman with basic medical terminology knowledge. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., “PROSTATA” vs. “PROSTATANÄYTTEET”) do not impede comprehension.
