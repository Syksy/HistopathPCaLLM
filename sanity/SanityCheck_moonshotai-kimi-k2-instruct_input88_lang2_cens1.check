#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (capsule, seminal vesicles, margins, etc.), which strongly implies that the specimen is prostate tissue. However, the exact sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “Tumör typ: OKLAR” (tumour type: UNCLEAR) and “Kan inte bestämmas fynd” (findings cannot be determined). No malignant diagnosis is given; instead, the findings are described as “OKLARA OCH DIVERSE FYND” (unclear and miscellaneous findings). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grade and Gleason score) are marked “-” (missing). No numeric or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar and terminology are typical of a Swedish pathology report and are understandable to a clinician or informed layperson. Minor non-standard formatting (e.g., repeated dashes) is domain-appropriate and does not impede comprehension.
