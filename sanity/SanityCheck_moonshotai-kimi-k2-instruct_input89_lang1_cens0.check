#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “lastut” (chips) and that they were examined in 7 blocks, which clearly indicates the sample type is prostate needle biopsies.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that approximately 40 % of the chips contain “Gleason 5+5=10 eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa” (prostate adenocarcinoma), and the summary line repeats “ADENOKARSINOOMA”. Thus malignancy is unambiguously confirmed.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 5 + 5 = 10 in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum components are directly available.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in clear Finnish understandable to a layman; only minor stylistic choices (e.g., “nähdään” instead of “todetaan”) are domain-typical and do not impede comprehension.
