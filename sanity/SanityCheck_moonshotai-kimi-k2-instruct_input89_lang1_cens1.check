#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that the samples were examined “kokonaisuudessaan blokeissa” (in their entirety in blocks), which implies tissue blocks from a prostate specimen. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TUR-P, or radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report states that “noin 40 % nähdään epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (about 40 % show suspicious changes) and lists “PROSTATANÄYTTEET: EPÄILYTTÄVIÄ MUUTOKSIA”. The word “epäilyttäviä” (suspicious) indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed; the findings are equivocal rather than clearly benign or malignant. Therefore malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major + minor = sum) or any information from which Gleason grading could be inferred are provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic points (e.g., the empty “T=, M=”) are common in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
