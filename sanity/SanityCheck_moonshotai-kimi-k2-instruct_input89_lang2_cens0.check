#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips) examined in 7 blocks, which is the standard way TUR-P (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens are handled. Therefore the sample type is clearly identified as TUR-P chips.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that “prostatas adenocarcinoma” (prostate adenocarcinoma) is found in about 40 % of the chips. This unequivocally indicates a malignant finding.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is explicitly given as 5 + 5 = 10, satisfying the requirement for major + minor = sum.

#7: Appropriate
