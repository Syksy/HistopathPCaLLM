#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen) but does not specify whether the material is biopsies, TUR-P chips, or a radical prostatectomy. Therefore, the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: While “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) raises concern, the statement explicitly avoids confirming malignancy. It remains inconclusive, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason scores (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can they be inferred from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Prov undesökat” likely intended “Prov undersökt”; “suspekt förändringar” should be “suspekta förändringar”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
