#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly identifies sample 3 as “radical prostatectomy preparate” and samples 1–2 as lymph-node specimens, so the sample type is clearly stated.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that “tumor tissue is observed in both lobes” with “invasive properties,” confirming malignancy. The lymph nodes are explicitly described as “free from malignant findings,” which is also a clear malignancy status.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is given as “4+3=7,” satisfying the required format (major + minor = sum).  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is understandable despite minor non-standard phrasing (“preparate” instead of “specimen,” “grandular” instead of “glandular”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
