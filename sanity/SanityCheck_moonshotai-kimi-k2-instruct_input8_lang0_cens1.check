#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samples with indices 1 and 2” and “sample 3”, but it never explicitly states what type of specimens these are (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.

#3: Partially  
#4: The text explicitly says that samples 1 and 2 are “completely free of malignant findings”, so malignancy status for those two is clear. For sample 3, however, the wording is ambiguous: “potentially interesting properties”, “varying growth patterns”, “highest identified Gleason patterns appear missing”, “no grade score is reported”, and “suspicion of PIN-changes were discussed”. These phrases indicate that malignancy status for sample 3 is inconclusive rather than confirmed benign or malignant.

#5: No  
#6: The statement explicitly states that the Gleason fields are empty (“empty fields ? and ? indicating major and minor”) and that “no grade score is reported”. Hence no usable Gleason score (major + minor = sum) can be extracted.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but contains several awkward or non-standard phrases (“covers approx 10%”, “empty fields ? and ?”, “PIN-changes were discussed at a meeting to approach consensus”). These do not render it incomprehensible, yet they could be improved for clarity.
