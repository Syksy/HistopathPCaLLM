#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “radikaaliprostatomian preparaatin” (radical prostatectomy specimen) in sample 3, so the sample type is clearly identifiable. Samples 1 and 2 are described as lymph-node samples, which are additional but do not contradict the main specimen type.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that tumour tissue is found in both lobes of the radical prostatectomy specimen, invading glandular structures. This is a malignant finding. The lymph-node samples are reported to be free of malignancy, but the prostate specimen itself is malignant.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is given directly as “4+3=7”, with the minor pattern (3) comprising about 30 %. This is a complete and valid Gleason score presentation.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is written in clear, professional Finnish understandable to a pathologist or informed lay reader. Medical terminology is used correctly, and the structure is coherent.
