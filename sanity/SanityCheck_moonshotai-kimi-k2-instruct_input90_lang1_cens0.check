#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) and lists the specimen parts (anterior fat, prostate), so the sample type is clearly identifiable.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement unequivocally diagnoses “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) in both the anterior fat (metastatic focus) and the prostate itself, so malignancy is confirmed.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives the primary Gleason pattern 5 and secondary pattern 3, explicitly stating “Gleason score: 8” and “5+3”. Thus the major+minor=sum format (5+3=8) is directly provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology understandable to professionals; lay readers might need clarification for some terms, but overall it is clear and grammatically correct.
