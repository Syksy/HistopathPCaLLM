#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäyte” (prostate sample) and lists fields such as “apexmarginaali”, “basismarginaali” and “ympärysmarginaali”, which are typical of a radical prostatectomy report. However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The report explicitly states “epäselvä luokittelu” (classification unclear) and “luokittelu jää auki” (classification left open). No malignant diagnosis is given; only “joitakin epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (some suspicious changes) are mentioned. Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primäärinen, sekundäärinen, tertiäärinen Gleason arvo and Gleason score) are left blank. No valid way to infer the scores is provided.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable, but it mixes Finnish and English terms (e.g., “Gleason score”, “UICC TNM 8th edition”) and leaves several fields empty, which may confuse a lay reader. Minor grammatical issues such as missing punctuation and inconsistent capitalization are present.
