#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a “radikal prostatektomi” (radical prostatectomy) and separately mentions “prostatas fettvävnad” (periprostatic adipose tissue). These designations unambiguously indicate the sample type.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report explicitly states the presence of “acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” with extensive local spread (capsular penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, bladder-neck invasion, vascular/perineural invasion) and metastatic tumour in the adipose tissue. Thus malignancy is clearly confirmed.

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason grade is given as 5, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8 (5+3). No tertiary pattern is reported. Therefore the required Gleason information is fully present.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is medical but understandable; minor non-standard phrasing such as “vänster posteriorisk” instead of “vänster posteriort” and “precis ren” instead of “helt ren” are acceptable within the histopathology domain and do not impede comprehension.
