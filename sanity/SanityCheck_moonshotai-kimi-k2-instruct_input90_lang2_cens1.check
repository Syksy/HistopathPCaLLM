#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate specimen), which implies a prostate sample, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially assessable.

#3: No  
#4: The text repeatedly uses phrases such as “suspekt fynd”, “några förändringar”, and “oklar klassificering”. These indicate that malignancy has not been confirmed; the findings are suspicious but inconclusive. Thus malignancy cannot be assessed as present or absent.

#5: No  
#6: Although fields for primary, secondary, tertiary Gleason grade and Gleason score are listed, none of them are filled in. Consequently the Gleason score cannot be inferred or assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “Upptäcks några suspekt fynd” should be “Upptäckta några suspekta fynd”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
