#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly mentions “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) and separately lists “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “ANTERIORINEN RASVA” (anterior fat), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “adenokarsinooma” (adenocarcinoma) in both the anterior fat focus and the prostate itself, confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives “Primäärinen Gleason arvo: 5” and “Sekundäärinen Gleason arvo: 3”, and explicitly states “Gleason score: 8” and “Gleason score 8 (5+3)”, so the major + minor = sum format (5+3=8) is directly provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is professional and understandable; minor Finnish-specific abbreviations (e.g., “pT3b”, “pNx”) are standard in pathology reports and do not hinder comprehension.
