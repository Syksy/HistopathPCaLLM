#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “PROSTATA” and “PROSTATANÄYTE”, which clearly indicate the specimen is prostate tissue, but it does not explicitly state whether the material comes from biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. Therefore the sample type is only partially identifiable.

#3: No  
#4: Although the report lists fields for Gleason scores and tumour characteristics, every numeric field is left blank and the descriptive text repeatedly states “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and “epäselvä luokittelu” (classification unclear). No definitive statement of malignancy or benignity is provided, so the malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, total score) are explicitly empty. The text offers no numeric or descriptive information from which a Gleason score could be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The report is generally understandable, but the repeated use of empty fields and the phrase “epäselvä luokittelu” may confuse a lay reader. Minor grammatical issues include inconsistent capitalisation and the unfinished “T=,, M =’”.
