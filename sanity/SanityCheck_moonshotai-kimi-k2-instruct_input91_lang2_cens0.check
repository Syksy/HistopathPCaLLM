#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly states “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report repeatedly mentions “adenocarcinoma” and “malignant” findings, including extraprostatic extension, seminal-vesicle invasion, and metastasis to periprostatic fat. Thus malignancy is unequivocally confirmed.

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason grade is given as 5, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 8 (5+3). Therefore the major+minor=sum format is directly provided.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is understandable despite some non-standard Swedish phrasing (e.g. “vänster posteriorisk”, “precis ren”). Medical terminology is used correctly and the overall meaning is clear to a trained reader.
