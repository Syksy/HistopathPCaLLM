#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and lists fields typical of a radical-prostatectomy report (capsule penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, bladder-neck invasion, multiple margin sites, etc.). However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, so we can only partially infer it.

#3: No  
#4: Although the form lists “Tumör typ” and Gleason fields, every value is left blank and the summary explicitly says “några förändringar, oklar klassificering” (some changes, unclear classification). Therefore malignancy cannot be assessed from the text.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grades and total score) are empty; no numeric or descriptive information is provided that would allow inference of a Gleason score.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish text is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor omissions (e.g., blank fields) are acceptable in a template-style report; the overall grammar and clarity are appropriate.
