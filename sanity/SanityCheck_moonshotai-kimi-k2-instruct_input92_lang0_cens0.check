#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “chippings” and “prostate chips,” which are standard terms for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens. Therefore, the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “approximately 17 of 257 … chips contain Gleason 4+5=9 prostatic adenocarcinoma” and the summary line reads “ADENOCARCINOMA, GLEASON SCORE 9 (4 + 5) GRADE GROUP 5.” These phrases unambiguously indicate the presence of malignant prostate adenocarcinoma.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is explicitly given as “4+5=9,” satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The grammar is clear and concise. Minor domain-specific shorthand (e.g., “chippings,” “T=77100, M=81403”) is acceptable in pathology reports and does not impede understanding.
