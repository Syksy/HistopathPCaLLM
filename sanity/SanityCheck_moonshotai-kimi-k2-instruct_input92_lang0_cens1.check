#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. Therefore the exact sample type cannot be fully determined.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only refers to “suspicious changes” and explicitly says they are “unable to categorise.” No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information (major + minor = sum) is supplied or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but “SOMESUSPICIOUS” should be two words (“SOME SUSPICIOUS”) and “T=, M=” is cryptic without explanation.
