#1: Yes  
#2: The statement mentions “lastut” (chips) and “eturauhaslastut” (prostate chips), which clearly indicates that the material examined consists of prostate biopsy cores. No other sample type is suggested.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states that 17/257 chips contained “Gleason 4+5=9 eturauhasadenokarsinoomaa” (prostate adenocarcinoma). The summary section repeats “ADENOKARSINOMA”, confirming the malignant nature of the findings.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is given directly as 4+5=9, and the Grade Group 5 is also provided. This is sufficient to infer the major pattern (4), minor pattern (5), and sum (9).

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is standard medical terminology and is readily understandable to professionals and informed laypersons. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “lastut tutkittiin kokonaisuudessaan 14 blokissa”) are acceptable in pathology reports.
