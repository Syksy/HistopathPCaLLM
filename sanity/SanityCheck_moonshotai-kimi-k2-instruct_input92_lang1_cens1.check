#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they have been examined “kokonaisuudessaan blokeissa” (in their entirety in blocks), which implies a histopathology specimen. However, it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsies, TUR-P chips, or a radical prostatectomy, so the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only reports “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “kategorisointi mahdotonta” (categorisation impossible). It neither confirms malignancy nor confirms benignity. Therefore the malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since malignancy is neither confirmed nor denied, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are standard placeholders in pathology reports and do not impede comprehension.
