#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to TUR-P (transurethral resection of prostate) specimens. The phrase “spån har undersökt i sin helhet i 14 block” clearly identifies the sample type as TUR-P chips examined in 14 blocks.

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states that “i 17/257 … spån” prostate adenocarcinoma is found, and the summary line reads “PROSTATASPÅN: ADENOCARCINOMA”. This unambiguously indicates malignant findings.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is explicitly given as “4+5=9” in both the descriptive text and the summary line, so the major, minor and sum scores are directly available.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “spån har undersökt” could be “spån har undersökts”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
