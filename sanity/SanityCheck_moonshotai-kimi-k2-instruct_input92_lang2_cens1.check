#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “PROSTATA PROV” (prostate sample) and that the entire specimen is processed into blocks, which implies a biopsy set. However, the exact sample type (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy) is not explicitly stated, so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The report only states that “suspect changes” are seen in about 7 % of the samples and that it is “impossible to categorise” them. No definitive malignant or benign diagnosis is given, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is rendered, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and understandable. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “i cirka 7 % av proven ses suspekt förändringar” could read “i cirka 7 % av proven ses suspekta förändringar”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
