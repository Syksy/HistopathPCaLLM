#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes between “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be guessed, not definitively assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes “suspicious changes” and mentions infiltration, perineural and extraprostatic extension, yet it explicitly says the changes are “unclear” and avoids confirming malignancy. Without a clear declaration of cancer, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor can any be inferred from the vague description of “suspicious changes”.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains grammatical slips (“bee” instead of “be”, inconsistent punctuation, and abrupt fragments like “2. RIGHT .”). These are minor and do not impede overall comprehension, yet they could be polished for clarity.
