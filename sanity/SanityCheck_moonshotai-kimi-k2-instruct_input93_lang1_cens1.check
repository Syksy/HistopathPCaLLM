#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “eturauhasnäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes left vs right, so we know the material is prostate biopsies. However, the exact type (needle biopsy, TURP, etc.) is not specified.

#3: No  
#4: The report describes “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) whose nature is “epäselvä” (unclear). No explicit statement of malignancy or benignity is given; the findings are inconclusive.

#5: No  
#6: Because malignancy is not confirmed, no Gleason pattern or score is provided or inferable.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable, but the punctuation is inconsistent (e.g., “OIKEA .” with a space before the period) and the Gleason fields “T=, M=” are left blank. These are minor issues that do not impede comprehension.
