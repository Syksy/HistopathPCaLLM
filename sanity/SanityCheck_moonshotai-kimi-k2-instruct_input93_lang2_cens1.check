#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and distinguishes “vänster” (left) and “höger” (right), which implies a paired biopsy set. However, it never explicitly states the sample type (e.g., core biopsies, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes “infiltrerad med några förändringar, vars karaktär är oklara” (infiltrated with some changes of unclear nature) and labels them “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes). This indicates that malignancy cannot be ruled out, but it is not confirmed either. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or can be inferred from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “prostata prov” should preferably be “prostatabiopsi” or “prostatavävnad”; “Fynds maximal längd” should be “Fyndets maximala längd”). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
