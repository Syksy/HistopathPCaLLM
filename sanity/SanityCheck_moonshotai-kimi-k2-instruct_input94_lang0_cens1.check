#1: Yes  
#2: The statement repeatedly mentions “PROSTATE” and lists regional lymph-node groups (obturator, external/internal iliac) that are typically harvested during a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymph-node dissection. This clearly indicates the sample type is a radical prostatectomy specimen.

#3: Partially  
#4: The prostate section is described only as having “some suspicious changes” and “unclear Gleason pattern or not.” While this implies the possibility of malignancy, it does not explicitly confirm adenocarcinoma. The lymph nodes are all negative, but the prostate itself remains inconclusive.

#5: No  
#6: Although fields for primary, secondary and tertiary Gleason patterns and the overall Gleason score are listed, none of them are filled in. Therefore the Gleason score (major+minor=sum) cannot be determined from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is generally understandable, but contains minor typographical issues such as “SUSPCIOUS” instead of “suspicious,” inconsistent spacing, and incomplete data fields. These do not render the statement incomprehensible, but they slightly reduce clarity.
