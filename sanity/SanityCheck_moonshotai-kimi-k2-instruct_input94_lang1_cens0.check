#1: Yes  
#2: The report explicitly states “RADIKAALI PROSTATEKTOMIA” (radical prostatectomy) in the summary, so the sample type is clearly identified.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report identifies “Asinaarinen eturauhasadenokarsinooma” (acinar prostate adenocarcinoma) and provides staging (pT2 pN0 M0), confirming malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The report gives the primary Gleason 4 and secondary Gleason 3, and explicitly states “Gleason score 7 (4+3)”, from which the major+minor=sum format (4+3=7) is directly inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is written in standard Finnish medical terminology and is understandable to a layman with minimal domain knowledge. Minor non-standard capitalization (e.g., “ANTERIORINEN RASVA”) does not impede comprehension.
