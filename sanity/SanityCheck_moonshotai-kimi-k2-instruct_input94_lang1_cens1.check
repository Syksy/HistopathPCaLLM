#1: Partially  
#2: The report mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and “PROSTATANÄYTTEET” (prostate samples), so the organ is clear. However, it does not explicitly state whether the specimen is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy. The presence of lymph-node dissection (obturator and iliac nodes) strongly implies a radical prostatectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy, but this is not spelled out.

#3: Partially  
#4: The prostate tissue shows “joitain epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (some suspicious changes) and “epäselvä Gleason luokitus” (unclear Gleason grading). This wording indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or excluded; the findings are inconclusive. All lymph nodes are negative, but the primary prostate specimen itself is not declared benign.

#5: No  
#6: The report explicitly states that Gleason grading is unclear (“epäselvä Gleason luokitus”) and leaves the Gleason score fields blank. Therefore, no valid major + minor = sum score can be extracted.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish text is understandable and uses standard medical terminology. Minor stylistic inconsistencies (e.g., missing spaces after colons) do not impede comprehension.
