#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATA” and “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI” (radical prostatectomy), so the sample type is clearly identifiable as a radical prostatectomy specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The report states “Tumörtyp: Acinar prostatas adenocarcinoma” and later “RADIKAL PROSTATEKTOMI - PROSTATAS ADENOCARCINOMA”, confirming the presence of malignant findings.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The primary Gleason grade is given as 4, the secondary as 3, and the Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7. Therefore the pattern 4+3=7 is directly provided.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is written in Swedish medical terminology that is clear and understandable to professionals. Minor non-standard phrasing (e.g., “ledig av tumör” instead of “fria från tumör”) is common in Swedish pathology reports and does not impede comprehension.
