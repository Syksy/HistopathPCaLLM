#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “PROSTATA” and lists several prostate-specific parameters (capsule penetration, seminal-vesicle invasion, margins, etc.), so the specimen is clearly from the prostate. However, the exact type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy) is never explicitly stated. The presence of regional lymph-node packets suggests a radical prostatectomy, but this is only inferred.

#3: Partially  
#4: The prostate section is described as having “några suspekt förändringar” (some suspicious changes) and an “oklart Gleason score” (unclear Gleason score). This indicates that malignancy cannot be ruled out, yet it is not confirmed either. The lymph-node packets are explicitly negative for tumour. Thus malignancy status is only partially assessable.

#5: No  
#6: Neither primary, secondary nor tertiary Gleason grades are provided, and the Gleason score field is left blank. The summary explicitly states “oklart Gleason score klassificering”. Therefore the Gleason score in the required format cannot be determined.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish text is generally understandable, but contains minor grammatical oddities such as “alla ledig av tumör” (should be “alla fria från tumör”) and inconsistent punctuation. These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
