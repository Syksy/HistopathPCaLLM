#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” but does not specify whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The phrase “samples have been entirely examined in blocks” hints at a biopsy set, yet this is not stated explicitly.

#3: No  
#4: The report only states “suspicious changes” and “need further examination.” It neither confirms nor rules out malignancy; therefore malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grades (major, minor, or sum) are provided, nor is there any information from which they could be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues: “10%of” should be “10 % of,” and the empty “T=, M=” line is superfluous.
