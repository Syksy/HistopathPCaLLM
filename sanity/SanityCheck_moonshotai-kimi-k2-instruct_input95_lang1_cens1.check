#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostanäytteet” (prostate samples) and that they were examined “kokonaisuudessaan blokeissa” (in their entirety in blocks), which implies tissue blocks from a prostate specimen. However, it does not explicitly state the sample type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), so the information is only partial.

#3: No  
#4: The statement only reports “epäilyttäviä muutoksia” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “vaatii jatkotutkimuksia” (requires further investigations). It neither confirms malignancy nor benignity, so the malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is given, no Gleason grading information is provided or inferable.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is understandable and domain-appropriate; minor shorthand like “T=, M=” is common in pathology reports.
