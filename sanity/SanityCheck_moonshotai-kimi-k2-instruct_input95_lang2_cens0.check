#1: Yes  
#2: The text explicitly mentions “spån” (chips), which in Swedish pathology reports refers to transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) chips. This clearly identifies the sample type.

#3: Yes  
#4: The statement unequivocally reports the presence of prostate adenocarcinoma in 15 of 153 chips, so malignancy is confirmed.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason score is given directly as 3 + 5 = 8, satisfying the requirement for major, minor, and sum scores.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish wording is concise and standard for a pathology report. Minor stylistic points (e.g., “spån har undersökt” could read “spån har undersökts”) do not impede understanding for a lay reader.
