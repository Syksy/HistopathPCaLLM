#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate sample) and that the entire specimen is examined in blocks, which implies a tissue sample, but it does not explicitly state whether the material is biopsy, TUR-P, or radical-prostatectomy tissue.  

#3: No  
#4: The report only states “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) and explicitly says “kräver ytterligare undersökning” (requires further examination). This indicates that malignancy has neither been confirmed nor excluded; therefore the malignant status cannot be assessed.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading is provided or inferable.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is concise and understandable; the abbreviations “T=, M=” are left empty, which is acceptable in a preliminary report.
