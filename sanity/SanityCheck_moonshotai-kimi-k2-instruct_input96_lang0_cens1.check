#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostate samples” and distinguishes “LEFT” and “RIGHT”, which implies that the material is prostate tissue, but it never explicitly states the specimen type (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore the sample type can only be partially inferred.

#3: No  
#4: The report repeatedly uses the phrases “suspicious changes which is unclear” and “suspicious findings”. These expressions indicate that malignancy has not been confirmed; the findings are equivocal and require further study. Hence the malignant status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because malignancy has not been confirmed, no Gleason grading has been provided, nor can it be inferred. Consequently, Gleason scores in the format major+minor=sum cannot be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains several grammatical issues: “changes which is unclear” should be “changes that are unclear”; “some prostate samples infiltrated by some suspicious findings” is awkward; “T=, M=” is incomplete. These are minor and do not prevent comprehension, but they could be improved for clarity.
