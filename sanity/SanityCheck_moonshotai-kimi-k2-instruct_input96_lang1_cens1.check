#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostatanäytteet” (prostate samples) and distinguishes left and right sides, but it never explicitly states whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy specimens. Therefore the sample type can only be inferred as “some form of prostate tissue” rather than clearly identified.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes “infiltrated by suspicious changes whose nature is unclear” and notes perineural invasion on the left side. These features strongly suggest malignancy, yet the pathologist deliberately labels the findings “unclear” and ends with “requires additional studies.” Thus malignancy is strongly implied but not formally declared.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major, minor, or sum) is provided, nor can one be reliably inferred from the descriptive text.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish wording is understandable and uses standard medical phrasing. Minor stylistic choices (e.g., “15 m” instead of “15 mm”) are evident but do not impede comprehension.
