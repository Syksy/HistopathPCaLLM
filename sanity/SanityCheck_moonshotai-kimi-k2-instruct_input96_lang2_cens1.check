#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “prostata prov” (prostate samples) twice, which implies that the material examined consists of prostate biopsies. However, the exact type of specimen (needle biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.) is not explicitly stated, so the assessment can only be partial.

#3: Partially  
#4: The report describes “suspekt förändringar” (suspicious changes) and uses terms such as “infiltrerad” and “perineural invasion,” which strongly suggest malignancy. Nevertheless, the wording stops short of a definitive malignant diagnosis (“KRÄVER YTTERLIGARE UNDERSÖKNING” – requires further investigation). Therefore malignancy status cannot be fully confirmed from the statement alone.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason pattern (major + minor = sum) or any equivalent grading information is provided. The suspicious findings are described qualitatively, but no numerical Gleason scores are mentioned or can be inferred.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish text is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “några prostata prov” should probably be “några prostata-prov” or “några prostatabiopsier”; “Fynds maximal längd” should be “Fyndets maximala längd”). These do not impede overall comprehension but are noticeable.
