#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly lists “PROSTATE” as one of the six examined specimen groups, indicating that the sample type is a radical prostatectomy (prostate with regional lymph-node dissection).  

#3: Partially  
#4: While the lymph-node sections describe “suspicious findings” and “some changes,” the prostate section itself is left almost entirely blank (no tumour type, Gleason score, or invasion status filled in). The summary merely states “SOME SUSPICIUS CHANGES, UNABLE TO DETERMINE.” Thus malignancy cannot be fully confirmed or excluded for the prostate tissue itself.  

#5: No  
#6: The Gleason fields (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary pattern and Gleason score) are all empty; no numerical or descriptive data are provided from which a Gleason score could be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The text is understandable despite the spelling error “SUSPICIUS” instead of “suspicious.” The structure and terminology are otherwise clear to a lay reader.
