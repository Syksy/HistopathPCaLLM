#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions “ETURAUHANEN” (prostate) and lists several prostate-specific parameters (Gleason fields, margins, extraprostatic extension, etc.), so we can infer the specimen is a radical prostatectomy. However, the actual specimen type is never explicitly stated, hence only “Partially”.

#3: No  
#4: The prostate section is completely blank—no tumour type, no Gleason scores, no size, no extension. The summary line says “JOITAIN EPÄILYTTÄVIÄ MUUTOKSIA, EI MÄÄRITELTÄVISSÄ” (“some suspicious changes, not definable, further studies needed”). This explicitly indicates that malignancy cannot be confirmed or ruled out; the findings are inconclusive.

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason-related fields (primary, secondary, tertiary, total score) are left empty. Because malignancy itself is not established, no Gleason score can be inferred.

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Finnish is clear and understandable. Minor stylistic choices such as capitalisation and spacing are acceptable in pathology reports. The lay reader can grasp that the prostate specimen shows uncertain changes requiring further work-up, while lymph-node and fat tissues appear benign.
