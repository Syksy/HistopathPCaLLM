#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clearly identifies the specimen as a radical prostatectomy (prostate + regional lymph-node dissection). The presence of prostate tissue, bilateral obturator and iliac lymph nodes, and seminal vesicles is explicitly listed, so the sample type is unequivocally assessable.  

#3: Partially  
#4: While the lymph-node stations are reported as mostly tumour-free, the prostate section itself is left blank for all tumour-related fields and is summarised as “några suspekt fynd, kan inte bestämmas” (“some suspicious findings, cannot be determined”). Thus malignancy status for the prostate is inconclusive; only the lymph-node status is clearly benign.  

#5: No  
#6: All Gleason fields (primary, secondary, tertiary grade and Gleason score) are empty. No numerical or descriptive information is provided from which a Gleason pattern could be inferred.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The Swedish text is grammatically correct and understandable, although it uses some non-standard abbreviations and formatting common in pathology reports. A lay reader might need clarification on terms like “ledig av tumör” (“free of tumour”), but overall the language is appropriate for its domain.
