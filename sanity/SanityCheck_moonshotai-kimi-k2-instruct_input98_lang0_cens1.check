#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “samples totalling 10 g” and refers to “post-BPH treatment consultation,” which implies a TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) specimen. However, the exact specimen type is never explicitly stated, so the assessment is only partial.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text explicitly states “suspicious of GLEASON pattern” and describes malignant-appearing components occupying ~40 % of the area, confirming that malignancy is present.

#5: Partially  
#6: The major component is described as ~40 % and the minor component as ~10 %, which allows an inferred Gleason pattern of 4 + 3 = 7. However, the actual Gleason grades (e.g., pattern 4 vs. pattern 3) are not explicitly given, so the assessment is only partial.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable but contains awkward phrasing such as “suspicious of GLEASON pattern” (should be “suspicious for Gleason pattern”) and “totalling around 10% of the area” (better as “comprising approximately 10 % of the area”). These are minor grammatical issues that do not impede comprehension.
