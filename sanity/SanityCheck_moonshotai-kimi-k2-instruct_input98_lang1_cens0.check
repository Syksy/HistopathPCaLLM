#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “virtsaputken kautta tehty resektio” (resection via the urethra), which corresponds to a TURP (transurethral resection of prostate) sample. Therefore, the sample type is clearly identifiable.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “löytyi todisteita adenokarsinoomasta” (evidence of adenocarcinoma was found), confirming the presence of malignancy.

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “major 4 ja minor 3”, allowing the sum to be inferred as 4+3=7. Thus, the Gleason score in the required format can be assessed.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but it contains a few grammatical or stylistic issues (e.g., “kasvaimettomalla alueella nähtävissä benign hyperplasiaa” mixes Finnish and English terminology, and “kasvaimettomalla” is slightly awkward). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but minor corrections would improve clarity.
