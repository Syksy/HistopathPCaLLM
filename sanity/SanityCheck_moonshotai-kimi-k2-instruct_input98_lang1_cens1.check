#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “näytteet” (samples) weighing 10 g, but it does not explicitly state whether these are biopsies, TURP chips, or radical-prostatectomy tissue. The weight alone is compatible with TURP or multiple biopsies, so the sample type can only be inferred, not unambiguously determined.

#3: Yes  
#4: The text clearly describes “epäilyttävistä muutoksista” (suspicious changes) with “epäily GLEASON patternista” (suspicion of Gleason pattern), mentions both major and minor components, and refers to cribriform structures. These phrases unequivocally indicate malignant findings.

#5: Partially  
#6: The major component is said to cover ~40 % of the tissue and the minor component ~10 %. However, no explicit Gleason pattern numbers (e.g., 3, 4, or 5) are given for either component, so the exact major+minor=sum cannot be derived. Only the relative proportions are provided.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable, but some phrasing is awkward or non-standard (e.g., “epäily GLEASON patternista” instead of “epäily Gleason-kuviosta”, “minor komponentit” instead of “minor-komponentit”). These are minor domain-specific quirks and do not impede comprehension.
