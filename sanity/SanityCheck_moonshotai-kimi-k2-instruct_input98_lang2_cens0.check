#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “Resektion genom urinrör” (transurethral resection) and that it yielded 10 g of chips, which clearly identifies the sample as a TUR-P (TURP) specimen.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states that “tecken av adenocarcinoma” (signs of adenocarcinoma) were found, confirming a malignant diagnosis.  

#5: Yes  
#6: The Gleason pattern is given directly as “major 4 och minor 3”, so the score can be expressed as 4 + 3 = 7.  

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall message is understandable, but there are several awkward or non-standard phrases (“vid undervisning” should probably be “vid undersökning”, “invänt av” likely means “invented by/observed by”, “cribriform-strukturer var invänt” is ungrammatical). These do not prevent comprehension but would benefit from correction for clarity.
