#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly mentions “electrosection shavings” and gives the weight of the material, which clearly identifies the specimen as TURP (transurethral resection) chips.  

#3: Yes  
#4: The text states “No malignant findings are observed” and concludes that the findings “fit the expected benign hyperplasia,” so the absence of malignancy is unambiguous.  

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Because no carcinoma is present, Gleason grading is not relevant; therefore it cannot and need not be assessed.  

#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is understandable and largely correct. Minor wording issues (“grandular” should be “glandular,” “fits” should be “fit”) do not impede comprehension for a lay reader.
