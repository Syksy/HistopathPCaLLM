#1: No  
#2: The text mentions “gram-level” material and “histological examination,” but it never specifies the source (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type cannot be assessed.

#3: No  
#4: The statement describes “large amounts of prostate tissue” and “epithelial borders appear normal,” but it explicitly states that “no definite conclusions can be drawn” and “erroneous sample handling is suspected.” No malignant or benign diagnosis is provided, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: No  
#6: No Gleason grading information (major, minor, or sum) is mentioned or inferable from the text.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Finnish is understandable but contains minor grammatical issues (e.g., “gramman verran näytemateriaalia” is awkward; “ajot tehtiin 8:ssa stepissä” is colloquial; “vaikuttaa normaalilta” should be “vaikuttaa normaalilta” or “vaikuttaa normaalilta” depending on intended nuance). These do not impede comprehension for a lay reader, but they are noticeable.
