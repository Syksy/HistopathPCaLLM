#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions “prostatavävnad” (prostate tissue) and describes handling of “provmaterial” (specimen material), but it never explicitly states the type of specimen (biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy, etc.). Therefore, the sample type can only be inferred as prostate tissue, not the specific clinical context.

#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly says “epitelets rand ser ut normal” (epithelial edge looks normal) and “man kan inte dra säker slutsats” (no reliable conclusion can be drawn). No mention of malignancy is made; instead, it emphasizes inconclusive findings and possible technical artefacts. Thus, malignancy status cannot be assessed.

#5: Not applicable  
#6: Since no malignant diagnosis is provided, Gleason grading is irrelevant. The statement neither gives nor implies any Gleason scores.

#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish is understandable but contains awkward phrasing (“andra halv kastas bort oanvänt”, “körning av prov görs i 8 steg”). Minor grammatical adjustments (e.g., “andra halvan kastas bort oanvänd”, “bearbetning av provet sker i åtta steg”) would improve clarity for a lay reader.
