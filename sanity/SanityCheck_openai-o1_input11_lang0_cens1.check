#1: No
#2: The text does not specify the exact sample type (e.g. biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy), only that multiple prostate regions were examined.
#3: No
#4: The statement remains inconclusive about malignancy; it neither confirms malignant findings nor states clearly that the tissue is benign.
#5: No
#6: Although Gleason grades 3 and 4 are mentioned, the final Gleason scoring (major+minor=sum) cannot be assessed because only 5% of the material was investigated and evaluation is inconclusive.
#7: Appropriate
#8: The statement is understandable and uses consistent grammar, with no major missteps in conveying the histopathological description.
