#1: Partially  
#2: The text implies examination of the entire prostate from base to apex, but it does not explicitly state whether it is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement does not confirm any malignancy or benign status; it only implies that Gleason grading might be assessed but does not state the final finding.  
#5: No  
#6: While the text mentions Gleason grades (3 to 5), it does not provide a concrete major+minor=sum format.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but it contains some grammatical and phrasing issues (e.g. “märkas på ett annan sätt,” “finns det alls eller är materialet helt normal”) that could be improved for clarity.
