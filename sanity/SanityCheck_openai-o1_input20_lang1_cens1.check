#1: Partially  
#2: The text specifies that prostate tissue samples have been obtained and divided into regions (apex to base), but does not explicitly clarify whether these are biopsies, a TURP specimen, or a radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly states that assessment of possible adenocarcinoma is impossible due to altered tissue from local treatments, so no definitive malignancy assessment can be made.  
#5: No  
#6: While it hypothetically mentions “3+4,” it is only a conjectured example and not presented as an actual Gleason score finding.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable and generally coherent but uses slightly informal or non-standard terms (e.g., “shiftailu”). Overall, it remains readable with only minor issues.
