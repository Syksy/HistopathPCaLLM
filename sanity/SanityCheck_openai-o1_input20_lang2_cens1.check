#1: Partially
#2: The text mentions “prostatavävnads prov” divided into six sets but does not clarify if they are biopsies, TURP, or a radical prostatectomy specimen.
#3: No
#4: It explicitly states that evaluating potential adenocarcinoma is impossible due to altered tissue, so malignancy cannot be definitively assessed.
#5: No
#6: A hypothetical “3+4” is mentioned but not confirmed, and no definitive Gleason sum or actual scoring is provided.
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The text is generally understandable, though it includes some unusual word choices and grammatical structures that could be improved for clarity.
