#1: Partially
#2: The text indicates prostate-derived tissue but does not specify whether it was from biopsies, TURP, or radical surgery.
#3: Partially
#4: There is uncertainty in the statement: it suggests a possible Gleason 3 pattern but does not conclusively confirm malignancy.
#5: No
#6: Only a possible Gleason 3 is mentioned, without major/minor or total score.
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The text is understandable but contains typographical/grammatical issues (e.g., "oelvaa" instead of "olevaa").
