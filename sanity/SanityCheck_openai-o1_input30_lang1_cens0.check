#1: Partially
#2: The text does not explicitly name the procedure (e.g. TURP, biopsy, prostatectomy) but implies involvement of resection chips (“lastuista”), suggesting a TUR-type sample without stating so definitively.
#3: Yes
#4: The text clearly upgrades a prior “epävarma” (3+3) diagnosis to adenocarcinoma, indicating malignancy.
#5: Yes
#6: The statement specifies a dominant pattern 4, a minor pattern 3, and a tertiary pattern 5, which implies a Gleason score of 4+3=7 with tertiary 5.
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The Finnish text is cohesive and understandable overall but contains a few possible typos (e.g. “todelle” could be “todella”).
