#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions macroscopic sections from the primary prostate and also discusses lymph nodes and seminal vesicles, which suggests a surgical specimen. However, it is not explicitly stated whether this is a radical prostatectomy specimen, biopsies, or another procedure.  
#3: No  
#4: There is no definitive statement about malignancy or benign disease. Mentioning that lymph nodes and seminal vesicles are “clean” only indicates no involvement there; it does not confirm or exclude a tumor in the prostate.  
#5: Not applicable  
#6: The statement does not mention or imply any Gleason score, and as malignancy cannot be assessed, Gleason scoring does not apply.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The Swedish text is mostly understandable but has some grammatical slips (“skiljar” should be “skiljer,” “ställer” should be “ställen”), though these errors do not make the statement incomprehensible.
