#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions a prostate-related sample with a weight but does not specify whether it is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: Yes  
#4: The statement shows only benign hyperplastic changes and chronic inflammation, indicating no malignancy.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention or format of a Gleason score.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable but has some awkward phrasing (e.g. “Findings do not indicate prostatic”) that may be missing a clarifying term such as “carcinoma.”
