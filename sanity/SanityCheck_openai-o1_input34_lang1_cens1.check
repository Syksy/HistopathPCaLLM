#1: No  
#2: The text does not explicitly state whether it is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: Yes  
#4: The statement describes benign hyperplastic prostate tissue with chronic inflammation and does not indicate malignancy.  
#5: Not applicable  
#6: Gleason scoring is irrelevant because there is no malignancy.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is mostly understandable, but “Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhasen” seems incomplete; it likely meant “Löydökset eivät viittaa eturauhaskarsinoomaan.”
