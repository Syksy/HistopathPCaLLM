#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions a prostate specimen but does not clarify if it is from a biopsy, TURP, or prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement explicitly says it cannot be determined if the finding is cancer or inflammation, so malignancy status cannot be assessed.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no reference to Gleason score, so it cannot be assessed.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable despite slightly unclear wording (e.g., “8?” and “en liten område”) and would benefit from minor grammatical clarification.
