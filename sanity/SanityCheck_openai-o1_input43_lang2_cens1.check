#1: Partially  
#2: A 30g prostate sample is mentioned, but the exact procedure type (e.g., TURP vs. radical vs. biopsy) is not explicitly stated.  
#3: No  
#4: The text explicitly states that no conclusion about cancer-related changes can be drawn, so malignancy cannot be definitively assessed.  
#5: No  
#6: No Gleason score is provided or inferable from the information given.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but contains some non-standard phrasing (e.g., “Material satts i kasetter och burken”), which could be improved for clarity.
