#1: Partially  
#2: The description includes capsule, margins, and seminal vesicles, which strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen, but it is not explicitly stated.  
#3: No  
#4: The text does not confirm whether the lesion is malignant or benign; it remains suspicious and requires further analysis.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention of any Gleason grading or pattern scores in the statement.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is generally understandable though some wording and phrasing (e.g., “körtelstrukturer och kanaler separerar,” “Krävar noggrannare undersökning”) are slightly non-standard.
