#1: Yes  
#2: The statement clarifies that the material is “obtained from multiple autopsies,” so the sample type is identifiable as autopsy-based.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement does not specify whether any of the observed changes are definitively malignant, so malignancy cannot be determined.  
#5: No  
#6: It is explicitly stated that due to the demonstration nature, no Gleason scoring is derived.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The overall text is understandable, though the parenthetical “(?)” and slightly fragmented structure could be improved for clarity.
