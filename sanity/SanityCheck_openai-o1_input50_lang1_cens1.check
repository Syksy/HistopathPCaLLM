#1: Yes
#2: The mention of different slides (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) and measured segments strongly suggests prostate biopsy specimens. 
#3: No
#4: The text mentions changes and “not definable” findings on the right side but no clear malignant or benign conclusion, thus malignancy cannot be definitively assessed. 
#5: No
#6: There is no mention or indication of Gleason scoring in the text. 
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The statement is understandable overall, but it has minor wording or grammatical issues (e.g., “Löydökset ei määritettävissä” instead of a more formal phrase).
