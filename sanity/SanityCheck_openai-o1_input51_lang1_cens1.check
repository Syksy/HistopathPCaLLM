#1: No  
#2: The text only mentions that “Näytteet valmistellaan kasetteihin” but does not clarify whether these are biopsies, TURP, or radical prostatectomy samples.  
#3: Partially  
#4: There is mention of infiltration (“Pääasiassa invasoi…”), suggesting something possibly malignant, but the statement concludes the nature is ‘määrittelemätön’ (indefinite) due to contamination, so a definitive malignancy assessment cannot be made.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention of Gleason patterns or any scoring information.  
#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is grammatically coherent and understandable, with appropriate domain language use.
