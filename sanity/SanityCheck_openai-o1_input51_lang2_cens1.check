#1: No  
#2: The text does not clarify if the material is from biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: While infiltration is described, the final verdict is uncertain due to contamination, so malignancy cannot be definitively assessed.  
#5: No  
#6: No Gleason details are provided.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: Although largely understandable, there are some linguistic inaccuracies (e.g. “mikroskopisk undervisning” likely meant “mikroskopisk undersökning”), but the text remains coherent overall.
