#1: Partially  
#2: The statement mentions samples from the right and left lobes but does not clearly specify if these are biopsies, TURP chips, or another sample type.  
#3: Partially  
#4: The presence of cribriform structures suggests malignancy, but the text does not explicitly confirm a malignant diagnosis.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no Gleason score reported, nor is there a clear means to infer it from the statement alone.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: Overall understandable, but lacks clarity regarding units (e.g., “60” likely mm), and some wording (e.g., “ei pystytä erottamaan erilaistumista”) is ambiguous.
