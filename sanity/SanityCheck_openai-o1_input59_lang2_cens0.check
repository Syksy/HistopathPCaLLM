#1: Yes  
#2: The statement explicitly indicates these are representative core needle biopsies from different prostatic lobes.  
#3: Yes  
#4: A malignant finding is stated (“cancer”), so the presence of adenocarcinoma can be assessed.  
#5: Partially  
#6: The text states “enbart Gleason 3” but also mentions cribriform structures (often considered Gleason pattern 4), creating a discrepancy. Thus, a clear 3+3=6 sum is not definitively confirmed.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable with small typographical errors (e.g. “repsentativa” instead of “representativa”) and slightly unusual phrasing (“Totala längds”); otherwise the meaning is coherent.
