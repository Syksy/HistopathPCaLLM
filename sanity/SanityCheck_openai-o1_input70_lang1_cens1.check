#1: Partially  
#2: The text mentions a prostate sample (“eturauhasnäyte”) and anterior fat tissue, but does not specify the exact procedure (e.g., biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy).  
#3: No  
#4: The findings are described as “epävarmoja” (uncertain) and there is no clear statement about malignancy or benignity.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention of Gleason grading or any scoring that could be interpreted as Gleason.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is understandable but somewhat terse, and it would benefit from clearer explanations and conclusions for a lay audience.
