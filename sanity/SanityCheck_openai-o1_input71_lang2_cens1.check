#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only indicates that the examined material originates from the prostate (“prostataprov”) without specifying whether it is, for example, a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The text describes inflammation and unspecified “other findings” with difficulty in determining them, so malignancy status cannot be concluded.  
#5: No  
#6: No Gleason score or any grading format is mentioned in the statement.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is largely comprehensible, though it includes some misspellings (“prostastaprov” vs. “prostataprov”) and truncated staging (T=, M=) without full explanation. Otherwise, it is generally understandable.
