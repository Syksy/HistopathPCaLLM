#1: Partially  
The text strongly suggests a prostate specimen, possibly a radical prostatectomy, given mentions of margins and extraprostatic extension, but it is never explicitly stated as such.  

#2: No  
Although the report format implies a tumor-related examination, it does not clearly confirm the presence of malignancy or a benign result. Key fields (like Gleason patterns) are blank.  

#3: No  
There are placeholders for Gleason patterns and score, but no actual values or definite statement of malignancy versus benign status.  

#4: No  
Because there are no numeric Gleason components provided, one cannot construct the major+minor=sum format.  

#5: Minor mistakes  
The statement is mostly understandable, but it contains a few errors (e.g., "determin," "RPOSTATE").  

#6: The text has small spelling errors but remains workable overall; spelling corrections (“determine,” “prostate”) would improve clarity.
