#1: Yes  
#2: The text describes prostate tissue with details on capsule penetration, margins, and other parameters typically reported in a radical prostatectomy, so it strongly suggests that the entire prostate specimen is examined.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement gives no definitive conclusion on whether the findings are malignant or benign; it only provides placeholders for Gleason but does not specify any final cancer diagnosis.  
#5: No  
#6: Although Gleason grades and score are referenced, no numeric values are provided, so the specific Gleason pattern cannot be assessed.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is mostly understandable though incomplete, with placeholder-like areas and some missing data; overall comprehensible but not fully standard.
