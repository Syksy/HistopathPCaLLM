#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only mentions a “prostate sample” (prostataprov) without clarifying if it is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: Yes  
#4: From the text, only PIN is identified and “kan inte avslutas typ av invasiv sjukdom,” meaning no invasive malignancy is confirmed.  
#5: Not applicable  
#6: Gleason grading is not relevant here because malignant (invasive) disease is not diagnosed, only PIN.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: There are minor grammatical issues in phrasing (“som mottagit”) but overall it is understandable.
