#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only mentions “prostate samples” in a general sense but does not specify the exact procedure (e.g. biopsy, TURP, radical prostatectomy).  
#3: Yes  
#4: The description of glandular and stromal hyperplasia and absence of any mention of carcinoma indicates benign changes, so malignancy can be excluded.  
#5: Not applicable  
#6: As there is no malignancy, Gleason scoring is irrelevant in this context.  
#7: Appropriate  
#8: The language is clear and comprehensible for a pathology report, with no significant grammatical issues.
