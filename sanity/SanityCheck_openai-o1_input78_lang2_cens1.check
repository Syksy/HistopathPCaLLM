#1: Partially  
#2: The text clarifies that samples come from the prostate (left and right), but it does not explicitly state if these are biopsies, a TURP sample, or a prostatectomy.  
#3: Partially  
#4: The text describes a suspicious 0.3 mm cluster without definitive conclusion on malignancy; thus, the presence of malignant findings cannot be conclusively determined.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention or indication of Gleason scoring, so it cannot be assessed from the statement.  
#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement is understandable and coherent, using expected terminology; no major language issues are apparent.
