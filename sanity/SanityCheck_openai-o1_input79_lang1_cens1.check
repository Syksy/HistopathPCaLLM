#1: Partially
#2: The statement mentions “anterior fat” and “prostate samples” but does not clearly specify whether this is a radical prostatectomy, biopsy, or another procedure. Hence only partial determination of the sample type is possible.
#3: No
#4: The report states that tumor type could not be identified and that the sample was contaminated, so malignancy versus benign cannot be conclusively assessed.
#5: Not applicable
#6: Since there is no confirmed malignancy, Gleason scoring does not apply and is not provided.
#7: Appropriate
#8: The statement, though technical and partly in Finnish, is understandable and follows standard pathology reporting format.
