#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only specifies “prostataprov” (prostate sample) but does not clarify if it is a biopsy, TURP, or radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The report describes suspicious findings and contamination but does not confirm or exclude malignancy.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention of Gleason grading.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is understandable overall but includes some awkward phrasing, e.g., "undersökningar kunde inte fortsatts vidare" could be phrased more clearly.
