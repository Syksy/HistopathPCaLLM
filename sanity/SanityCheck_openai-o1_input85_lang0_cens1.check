#1: Yes
#2: The mention of prostate margins (apex, base, circumferential) and a separate seminal vesicle fragment strongly suggests a radical prostatectomy specimen rather than biopsies or other sample types
#3: No
#4: While there are suspicious findings beyond the prostate edge, the report explicitly states “Tumour type: Unclear” and no definitive malignancy is confirmed
#5: No
#6: The Gleason pattern and score fields are left blank, so no definitive Gleason grading is provided
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The statement is generally understandable, though some phrases (e.g. “Need more examination”) are incomplete and could be clarified with standard grammar and phrasing
