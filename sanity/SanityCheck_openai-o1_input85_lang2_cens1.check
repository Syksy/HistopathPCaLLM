#2: The text clearly indicates that prostate tissue (plus anterior fat and a seminal vesicle fragment) was examined, suggesting a radical prostatectomy specimen or similar resection.

#6: Although Gleason grades are listed, they are all blank, so the exact Gleason pattern or sum cannot be determined.  
#7: Appropriate  
#8: The statement uses typical pathology notations in Swedish; despite being technical, it is coherent enough to be understood, and thus the grammar and style are acceptable.
