#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only specifies “prostate samples” without clarifying whether they are biopsies, TURP, or from a radical prostatectomy.  
#3: No  
#4: The term “suspicious changes” does not confirm malignancy or definitively rule it out, so malignancy cannot be assessed.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no mention or inference of Gleason scoring in the statement.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: There is a misspelling (“SUSPIOUCE”) but otherwise the content is largely understandable.
