#1: No  
#2: The text does not clarify if the material is from biopsies, TURP chips, or a radical prostatectomy; it only references “samples” without specifying the type.  
#3: Partially  
#4: While samples 1 and 2 are said to lack malignancy entirely, the status of sample 3 is inconclusive (mention of possible PIN-changes but no definitive cancer diagnosis).

#6: A Gleason score is referenced but no actual major+minor=sum is provided, indicating missing data.  
#7: Appropriate
