#1: Partially  
#2: The text indicates that samples 1 and 2, and a third sample exist, with at least the third containing prostate tissue, but it does not clearly specify whether these are biopsies, TURP material, or resection specimens.  
#3: Partially  
#4: Samples 1 and 2 are stated to be free of malignancy, but the third sample’s malignant status is uncertain due to suspected PIN and incomplete data.  
#5: No  
#6: A specific Gleason score is not reported; places for major and minor are marked with question marks, preventing assessment.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is largely understandable, but some grammatical constructs (e.g., “värkas att sakna,” “ögonskenlig”) appear nonstandard or incomplete.
