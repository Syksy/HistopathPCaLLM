#1: Yes  
#2: The mention of margins (apex, base) and extraprostatic extension indicates this is most likely a radical prostatectomy specimen, so the sample type can be identified.  
#3: No  
#4: Although the text refers to “tumour,” it remains suspicious/unclear, and there is no definitive statement declaring malignancy or benignancy.  
#5: No  
#6: Gleason patterns or a Gleason sum are not provided; only placeholders are present.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The statement is mostly understandable but contains typos (“suspioce”), and minor grammar issues (“changes is observed”).
