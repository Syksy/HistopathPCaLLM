#1: Yes  
#2: The report describes multiple surgical specimens (prostate and lymph nodes), so the sample type is identifiable.  
#3: Partially  
#4: The text mentions suspicious changes in the prostate but does not definitively establish malignancy or benignity.  
#5: No  
#6: The Gleason details are listed only as placeholders without actual numerical values.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is largely comprehensible, but some expressions (“ledig av tumör” instead of “fri från tumör”) and incomplete sections introduce minor grammatical or clarity issues.
