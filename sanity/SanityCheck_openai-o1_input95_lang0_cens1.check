#1: Partially  
#2: The statement only mentions “Prostate samples” without indicating whether these are biopsies, a TURP sample, or a radical prostatectomy specimen.  
#3: No  
#4: The statement mentions “suspicious changes” but does not confirm or refute malignancy.  
#5: No  
#6: There is no definitive mention of a Gleason score in the statement.  
#7: Minor mistakes  
#8: The text is largely understandable but some details (e.g., “T=,” “M=”) are incomplete, and the phrasing around “10% of samples are suspicious” could be clarified.
