#1: Yes
#2: The text describes prostate tissue (with margins) and multiple lymph node samples, consistent with a radical prostatectomy specimen and lymph node dissection.  
#3: Partially
#4: There are suspicious findings in some lymph nodes and in the prostate, but no definitive statement confirming malignancy.  
#5: No
#6: Gleason grad/score fields are only placeholders, so they cannot be determined from the text.  
#7: Minor mistakes
#8: The text is understandable overall but contains a few typographical or phrasing issues (e.g., “MARIGNALER”).
